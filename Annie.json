All of the drugs we have now were made possible by patients who were brave enough to try those drugs. The words  clinical trial  have always been surrounded by mystery  anxiety and even a hint of desperation   at least for me. Like many people  I thought of clinical trials as a last ditch Hail Mary to save my life when all other options had been exhausted. During the course of my treatment for stage 4 ovarian cancer I ve learned differently. I m currently in a phase 1 clinical trial  so I thought sharing my experience might be useful in dispelling some of the myths as other patients with cancer consider whether to participate in a trial.  My oncologist recommended trying a clinical trial while I still had standard of care options available. While this isn t an option for every patient with cancer   depending on number of available',

What are clinical trials? Doctors and scientists are always looking for better ways to care for people with ovarian/fallopian tube cancer. To make scientific advances  doctors create research studies involving volunteers  called clinical trials. Every drug that is now approved by the FDA was tested in clinical trials. Clinical trials are used for all types and stages of ovarian  fallopian tube  and peritoneal cancer. Many focus on new treatments to learn if a new treatment is safe  effective  and possibly better than the existing treatments. These types of studies evaluate new drugs  different combinations of treatments  new approaches to radiation therapy or surgery  and new methods of treatment. People who participate in clinical trials can be some of the first to get a treatment before it is available to the public. However  there are some risks with a clinical trial  including possible side effects and the chance that the new treatment may not work. Clinical trials do',

I first wrote about my clinical trial experiences eight months ago  shortly after I enrolled in my first study in hopes of stopping the progression of my stage 4 ovarian cancer. Now seems like a good time to give an update that might help other cancer patients who are considering a similar path. My first clinical trial went well for six months. The drug had few side effects. I disliked taking oral steroids for three days every three weeks and I gained six pounds in six months. But my tumor markers were dropping steadily so I was willing to pay that price. The week my first CT scan was scheduled  my markers dropped just within the normal range for the first time. At that point I wasn t even nervous about the scan. Rookie mistake. The scan showed progression  not a lot  but enough that I had to withdraw from the study.',

For anyone who chooses to join a clinical trial  they will receive the best care available and help themselves as well as others by contributing to research.         What is an ovarian cancer clinical trial? Why should I consider participating? Clinical trials are research studies designed to find ways to improve health  answer scientific questions and find better ways to prevent  diagnose or treat cancer. For many women with ovarian cancer  investigational treatments may offer new hope. Through participation in these trials  patients may receive access to new therapy options that are not available beyond the clinical trial setting.
