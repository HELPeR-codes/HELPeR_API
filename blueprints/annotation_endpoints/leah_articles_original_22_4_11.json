        "text": "What Is Ovarian Cancer?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n \n \n  \n \n   Cancer starts when cells in the body begin to grow out of control. Cells in nearly any part of the body can become cancer and can spread. To learn more about how cancers start and spread, see What Is Cancer?\n \n   Ovarian cancers were previously believed to begin only in the ovaries, but recent evidence suggests that many ovarian cancers may actually start in the cells in the far (distal) end of the fallopian tubes.\n    \n \n   What are the ovaries?\n \n   Ovaries are reproductive glands found only in females (women). The ovaries produce eggs (ova) for reproduction. The eggs travel from the ovaries through the fallopian tubes into the uterus where the fertilized egg settles in and develops into a fetus. The ovaries are also the main source of the female hormones estrogen and progesterone. One ovary is on each side of the uterus.\n \n  \n \n \n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n \n \n  \nThe ovaries are mainly made up of 3  kinds of cells. Each type of cell can develop into a different type of tumor:\n \n   \n   Epithelial tumors start from the cells that cover the outer surface of the ovary. Most ovarian tumors are epithelial cell tumors.\n \n   Germ cell tumors start from the cells that produce the eggs (ova).\n \n   Stromal tumors start from structural tissue cells that hold the ovary together and produce the female hormones estrogen and progesterone.\n \n  \n \n  Some of these tumors are benign (non-cancerous) and never spread beyond the ovary. Malignant (cancerous) or borderline (low malignant potential) ovarian tumors can spread (metastasize) to other parts of the body and can be fatal. \n  \n  Epithelial ovarian tumors\n \n  Epithelial ovarian tumors start in the outer surface of the ovaries. These tumors can be benign (not cancer), borderline (low malignant potential), or malignant (cancer).\n \n  Benign epithelial ovarian tumors\n \n   Epithelial ovarian tumors that are benign don’t spread and usually don’t lead to serious illness. There are several types of benign epithelial tumors including serous cystadenomas, mucinous cystadenomas, and Brenner tumors.\n \n  Borderline Epithelial Tumors \n \n  When looked at in the lab, some ovarian epithelial tumors don’t clearly appear to be cancerous and are known as borderline epithelial ovarian cancer\n. The two most common types are \n    atypical proliferative serous carcinoma and atypical proliferative mucinous carcinoma. These tumors were previously called tumors of low malignant potential (LMP tumors)\n. These are different from typical ovarian cancers because they don’t grow into the supporting tissue of the ovary (called the ovarian stroma\n). If they do spread outside the ovary, for example, into the abdominal cavity (belly), they might grow on the lining of the abdomen but not into it.\n \n  Borderline tumors tend to affect younger women than the typical ovarian cancers. These tumors grow slowly and are less life-threatening than most ovarian cancers. \n \n  Malignant epithelial ovarian tumors\n \n  Cancerous epithelial tumors are called carcinomas\n. About 85% to 90% of malignant ovarian cancers are epithelial ovarian carcinomas. These tumor cells have several features (when looked at in the lab) that can be used to classify epithelial ovarian carcinomas into different types. The serous\n type is by far the most common, and can include high grade and low grade tumors. The other main types include mucinous\n, endometrioid\n, and clear cell\n.\n \n   \n   Serous carcinomas (52%)\n \n   Clear cell carcinoma (6%)\n \n   Mucinous carcinoma(6%) \n \n   Endometrioid carcinoma (10%) \n \n  \n \n  Each ovarian cancer is given a grade, based on how much the tumor cells look like normal tissue: \n \n   \n   Grade 1 epithelial ovarian carcinomas look more like normal tissue and tend to have a better prognosis (outlook). \n \n   Grade 3 epithelial ovarian carcinomas look less like normal tissue and usually have a worse outlook. \n     \n \n  \n  \n  Other traits are also taken into account, such as how fast the cancer cells grow and how well they respond to chemotherapy, to come up with the tumor's type:\n \n \n   \n   Type I tumors tend to grow slowly and cause fewer symptoms. These tumors also seem not to respond well to chemotherapy. Low grade (grade 1) serous carcinoma, clear cell carcinoma, mucinous carcinoma and endometrioid carcinoma are examples of type I tumors.\n \n   Type II tumors grow fast and tend to spread sooner. These tumors tend to respond better to chemotherapy. High grade (grade 3) serous carcinoma is an example of a type II tumor.\n \n  \n    \n  Other cancers that are similar to epithelial ovarian cancer\n \n  Primary peritoneal carcinoma\n \n  Primary peritoneal carcinoma (PPC) is a rare cancer closely related to epithelial ovarian cancer. At surgery, it looks the same as an epithelial ovarian cancer that has spread through the abdomen. In the lab, PPC also looks just like epithelial ovarian cancer. Other names for this cancer include extra-ovarian\n (meaning outside the ovary) primary peritoneal carcinoma\n (EOPPC) and serous surface papillary carcinoma\n.\n \n  PPC appears to start in the cells lining the inside of the fallopian tubes.\n \n  Like ovarian cancer, PPC tends to spread along the surfaces of the pelvis and abdomen, so it is often difficult to tell exactly where the cancer first started. This type of cancer can occur in women who still have their ovaries, but it is of more concern for women who have had their ovaries removed to prevent ovarian cancer. This cancer does rarely occur in men.\n \n  Symptoms of PPC are similar to those of ovarian cancer, including abdominal pain or bloating, nausea, vomiting, indigestion, and a change in bowel habits. Also, like ovarian cancer, PPC may elevate the blood level of a tumor marker called CA-125.\n \n  Women with PPC usually get the same treatment as those with widespread ovarian cancer. This could include surgery to remove as much of the cancer as possible (a process called debulking that is discussed in the section about surgery), followed by chemotherapy like that given for ovarian cancer. Its outlook is likely to be similar to widespread ovarian cancer.\n \n  Fallopian tube cancer\n \n  This is another rare cancer that is similar to epithelial ovarian cancer. It begins in the tube that carries an egg from the ovary to the uterus (the fallopian tube). Like PPC, fallopian tube cancer and ovarian cancer have similar symptoms. The treatment for fallopian tube cancer is much like that for ovarian cancer, but the outlook (prognosis) is slightly better.\n \n  Ovarian germ cell tumors\n \n  Germ cells usually form the ova or eggs in females and the sperm in males. Most ovarian germ cell tumors are benign, but some are cancerous and may be life threatening. Less than 2% of ovarian cancers are germ cell tumors. Overall, they have a good outlook, with more than 9 out of 10 patients surviving at least 5 years after diagnosis. There are several subtypes of germ cell tumors. The most common germ cell tumors are teratomas\n, dysgerminomas\n, endodermal sinus tumors\n, and choriocarcinomas\n. Germ cell tumors can also be a mix of more than a single subtype.\n \n  Teratoma\n \n  Teratomas are germ cell tumors with areas that, when seen under the microscope, look like each of the 3 layers of a developing embryo: the endoderm\n (innermost layer), mesoderm\n (middle layer), and ectoderm\n (outer layer). This germ cell tumor has a benign form called mature \nteratoma and a cancerous form called immature\n teratoma.\n \n  The mature teratoma is by far the most common ovarian germ cell tumor. It is a benign tumor that usually affects women of reproductive age (teens through forties). It is often called a dermoid cyst\n because its lining is made up of tissue similar to skin (dermis). These tumors or cysts can contain different kinds of benign tissues including, bone, hair, and teeth. The patient is cured by surgical removal of the cyst, but sometimes a new cyst develops later in the other ovary.\n \n  Immature teratomas are a type of cancer. They occur in girls and young women, usually younger than 18. These are rare cancers that contain cells that look like those from embryonic or fetal tissues such as connective tissue, respiratory passages, and brain. Tumors that are relatively more mature (called grade 1 immature teratoma\n) and haven’t spread beyond the ovary are treated by surgical removal of the ovary. When they have spread beyond the ovary and/or much of the tumor has a very immature appearance (grade 2 or 3 immature teratomas), chemotherapy is recommended in addition to surgery.\n \n  Dysgerminoma\n \n  This type of cancer is rare, but it is the most common ovarian germ cell cancer It usually affects women in their teens and twenties. Dysgerminomas are considered malignant (cancerous), but most don’t grow or spread very rapidly. When they are limited to the ovary, more than 75% of patients are cured by surgically removing the ovary, without any further treatment. Even when the tumor has spread further (or if it comes back later), surgery, radiation therapy, and/or chemotherapy are effective in controlling or curing the disease in about 90% of patients.\n \n  Endodermal sinus tumor (yolk sac tumor) and choriocarcinoma\n \n  These very rare tumors typically affect girls and young women. They tend to grow and spread rapidly but are usually very sensitive to chemotherapy. Choriocarcinoma that starts in the placenta (during pregnancy) is more common than the kind that starts in the ovary. Placental choriocarcinomas usually respond better to chemotherapy than ovarian choriocarcinomas do.\n \n  Ovarian stromal tumors\n \n  About 1% of ovarian cancers are ovarian stromal cell tumors. More than half of stromal tumors are found in women older than 50, but about 5% of stromal tumors occur in young girls.\n \n  The most common symptom of these tumors is abnormal vaginal bleeding. This happens because many of these tumors produce female hormones (estrogen). These hormones can cause vaginal bleeding (like a period) to start again after menopause. In young girls, these tumors can also cause menstrual periods and breast development to occur before puberty.\n \n  Less often, stromal tumors make male hormones (like testosterone). If male hormones are produced, the tumors can cause normal menstrual periods to stop. They can also make facial and body hair grow. If the stromal tumor starts to bleed, it can cause sudden, severe abdominal pain.\n \n  Types of malignant (cancerous) stromal tumors include granulosa cell\n tumors (the most common type), granulosa-theca\n tumors, and Sertoli-Leydig cell\n tumors, which are usually considered low-grade cancers. Thecomas \nand fibromas\n are benign stromal tumors. Cancerous stromal tumors are often found at an early stage and have a good outlook, with more than 75% of patients surviving long-term.\n \n  Ovarian cysts\n \n  An ovarian cyst is a collection of fluid inside an ovary. Most ovarian cysts occur as a normal part of the process of ovulation (egg release) -- these are called functional cysts\n. These cysts usually go away within a few months without any treatment. If you develop a cyst, your doctor may want to check it again after your next menstrual cycle (period) to see if it has gotten smaller.\n \n  An ovarian cyst can be more concerning in a female who isn't ovulating (like a woman after menopause or a girl who hasn't started her periods), and the doctor may want to do more tests. The doctor may also order other tests if the cyst is large or if it does not go away in a few months. Even though most of these cysts are benign (not cancer), a small number of them could be cancer. Sometimes the only way to know for sure if the cyst is cancer is to take it out with surgery. Cysts that appear to be benign (based on how they look on imaging tests) can be observed (with repeated physical exams and imaging tests), or removed with surgery.\n"

        "text": "What's New in Ovarian Cancer Research?\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n \n \n  \n \n   Risk factors and causes\n \n   Scientists continue to study the genes responsible for familial ovarian cancer. This research is beginning to yield clues about how these genes normally work and how disrupting their action can lead to cancer. This information eventually is expected to lead to new drugs for preventing and treating familial ovarian cancer.\n \n   Research in this area has already led to better ways to detect high-risk genes and assess a woman's ovarian cancer risk. A better understanding of how genetic and hormonal factors (such as oral contraceptive use) interact may also lead to better ways to prevent ovarian cancer.\n \n   Prevention\n \n   New information about how much BRCA1 \nand BRCA2\n gene mutations increase ovarian cancer risk is helping women make practical decisions about prevention. For example, mathematical models have been developed that help estimate how many years of life an average woman with a BRCA\n mutation might gain by having both ovaries and fallopian tubes removed to prevent a cancer from developing. Studies have shown that fallopian tube cancers develop in women with BRCA\n gene mutations more often than doctors had previously suspected. However, it is important to remember that although doctors can predict the average outcome of a group of many women, it is still impossible to accurately predict the outcome for any individual woman.\n \n   Studies suggest that many primary peritoneal cancers and some ovarian cancers (such as high-grade serous carcinomas) actually start in the fallopian tubes. According to this theory, the early changes of these cancers can start in the fallopian tubes. Cells from these very early fallopian tube cancers can become detached and then stick to the surface of the peritoneum or the ovaries. For reasons that are still not understood, these cancer cells may grow more rapidly in their new locations.\n \n   This theory has important implications for preventing ovarian cancer because having the ovaries removed early can cause problems from lack of estrogen, such as bone loss, cardiovascular disease, and menopause symptoms. Some experts have suggested recently that some women who are concerned about their ovarian cancer risk (especially those with a strong family history and/or BRCA\n gene mutations) consider having just their fallopian tubes removed first. They then can have their ovaries removed when they are older. This approach lets women keep their ovaries functioning for longer, but because of that, it might not help breast cancer risk as much. This is an active area of research.\n \n   Other studies are testing new drugs for ovarian cancer risk reduction.\n \n   Researchers are constantly looking for clues such as lifestyle, diet, and medicines that may alter the risk of ovarian cancer.\n \n   Early detection\n \n   Being able to find ovarian cancer early could have a great impact on the cure rate. Researchers are testing new ways to screen women for ovarian cancer. One method being tested is looking at the pattern of proteins in the blood (called proteomics\n) to find ovarian cancer early.\n \n   Imaging\n \n   The use of new imaging techniques such as Functional MRI are being evaluated in ovarian cancers. PET/CT scans are also being studied  to see where they may be best used for ovarian cancer. \n     \n   \n   Diagnosis\n \n   For women who have an ovarian tumor, a test called OVA1 can measure the levels of 5 proteins in the blood. The levels of these proteins, when looked at together, are used to determine whether a woman's tumor should be considered low risk or high risk. If the tumor is labeled \"low risk\" based on this test, the woman is not likely to have cancer. If the tumor is considered \"high risk,\" the woman is more likely to have a cancer, and should see a specialist (a gynecologic oncologist). This test is NOT a screening test and it is NOT a test to decide if you should have surgery or not. It is meant for women who have an ovarian tumor where surgery has been decided but have not yet been referred to a gynecologic oncologist.\n \n   Treatment\n \n   Treatment research includes testing the value of currently available methods as well as developing new approaches to treatment.\n \n   Chemotherapy\n \n   New chemotherapy (chemo) drugs and drug combinations are being tested. \n \n   When the drugs cisplatin and carboplatin stop working, the cancer is said to be platinum resistant\n. Studies are looking for many ways to make these cancers sensitive to these drugs again. Different strategies include:\n \n    \n    Looking closely at what specific mechanisms and proteins are involved in the making ovarian cancer cells resistant.\n \n    Developing drugs that can keep the cancer cells from becoming resistant to the chemo by blocking channels that pump chemotherapy out of the cancer cell.\n  \n    Trying to determine the details of certain cancer cells where the DNA is not damaged by chemotherapy which allows it to keep growing. \n      \n \n   \n \n   Although carboplatin is preferred over cisplatin in treating ovarian cancer if the drug is to be given IV, cisplatin is used in intraperitoneal (IP) chemotherapy. Studies are looking at giving carboplatin for IP chemo.\n \n   Another approach is to give IP chemo during surgery using heated drugs. This, known as heated intraperitoneal chemotherapy or HIPEC, can be effective. More studies are showing this to be beneficial and may improve how long a woman lives. \n     \n \n   Targeted therapy\n \n   Targeted therapy is a newer type of cancer treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack cancer cells while doing little damage to normal cells. Each type of targeted therapy works differently, but they all attack the cancer cells' inner workings − the programming that makes them different from normal, healthy cells. Bevacizumab (Avastin) is the targeted therapy that has been studied best in ovarian cancer, but other similar drugs, like pembrolizumab, are being looked at, as well. \n \n    Catumaxomab is a drug being studied specifically for people with malignant ascites (fluid buildup in the abdomen [belly] caused by cancer cells). It works by targeting 3 different cell types including tumor cells and white blood cells called T-cells. \n \n   Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARPs) are enzymes that have been recently recognized as key regulators of cell survival and cell death. Drugs that inhibit PARP-1 (called PARP inhibitors) have been approved for patients with ovarian cancer caused by mutations in BRCA1\n and BRCA2\n. New evidence shows that ovarian cancers can also become resistant to treatment with PARP inhibitors. Research is trying to find ways to counteract this process. \n     \n  \n   Genetic therapies\n  \n   For ovarian and breast cancers that are caused by the BRCA 1 mutation, it has been shown that low levels of the BRCA 1 mutation are associated with good responses to PARP inhibitors and platinum drugs, like cisplatin and carboplatin. New research shows that microRNA, very small pieces of RNA (substances that carry genetic messages for DNA), can also lower levels of BRCA1 mutations. New drugs that can target these tiny pieces of RNA are being investigated as possible ways to treat these cancers. \n     \n"

        "topic": "General Information:Causes, Risk Factors and Prevention",
        "text": "A risk factor is anything that increases your chance of getting a disease like cancer. Different cancers have different risk factors. Some risk factors, like smoking, can be changed. Others, like a person’s age or family history, can’t be changed.\n \n  But having a risk factor, or even many, does not mean that you will get the disease. And some people who get the disease may not have any known risk factors. Researchers have discovered several risk factors that might increase a woman's chance of developing  ovarian cancer. These risk factors don’t apply to other less common types of ovarian cancer like germ cell tumors and stromal tumors.\n \n  Factors that increase your risk of ovarian cancers\n \n  Getting older\n \n  The risk of developing ovarian cancer gets higher with age. Ovarian cancer is rare in women younger than 40. Most ovarian cancers develop after menopause. Half of all ovarian cancers are found in women 63 years of age or older.\n \n  Being overweight or obese\n \n  Obesity has been linked to a higher risk of developing many cancers. The current information available for ovarian cancer risk and obesity is not clear. \n   Obese women (those with a body mass index [BMI] of at least 30) probably have a higher risk of developing ovarian cancer, but not necessarily the most aggressive types, such as high-grade serous cancers.\n    Obesity may also negatively affect the overall survival of a woman with ovarian cancer.\n   \n \n  Having children later or never having a full-term pregnancy\n   \n \n  Women who have their first full-term pregnancy after age 35 or who never carried a pregnancy to term have a higher risk of ovarian cancer.\n \n  \n   \n \n  Taking hormone therapy after menopause\n \n  Women using estrogens alone or with progesterone after menopause have an increased risk of developing ovarian cancer compared to women who have never used hormones. \n   \n \n  Having a family history of ovarian cancer, breast cancer, or colorectal cancer\n \n  Ovarian cancer can run in families. Your \novarian cancer risk is increased if your mother, sister, or daughter has (or has had) ovarian cancer. The risk also gets higher the more relatives you have with ovarian cancer. Increased risk for ovarian cancer can also come from your father's side.\n \n  A family history of some other types of cancer such as colorectal and breast cancer is linked to an increased risk of ovarian cancer. This is because these cancers can be caused by an inherited mutation (change) in certain genes that cause a family cancer syndrome that increases the risk of ovarian cancer.\n \n  Having a family cancer syndrome\n \n  Up to 25%\n    of ovarian cancers are a part of family cancer syndromes resulting from inherited changes (mutations) \nin certain genes.\n \n  Hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome (HBOC)\n \n  This syndrome is caused by inherited mutations in the genes BRCA1\n and BRCA2\n, as well as possibly some other genes that have not yet been found. This syndrome is linked to a high risk of breast cancer as well as ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancers. The risk of some other cancers, such as pancreatic cancer and prostate cancer, are also increased.\n \n  Mutations in BRCA1\n and BRCA2\n are also responsible for most inherited ovarian cancers. Mutations in BRCA1\n and BRCA2\n are about 10 times more common in those who are Ashkenazi Jewish than those in the general U.S. population.\n   \n \n  The lifetime ovarian cancer risk for women with a BRCA1\n mutation is estimated to be between 35% and 70%. This means that if 100 women had a BRCA1\n mutation, between 35 and 70 of them would get ovarian cancer. For women with BRCA2\n mutations the risk has been estimated to be between 10% and 30% by age 70. These mutations also increase the risks for primary peritoneal carcinoma and fallopian tube carcinoma.\n \n  In comparison, the ovarian cancer lifetime risk for the women in the general population is less than 2%.\n   \n \n   \n \n  Hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer (HNPCC)\n \n  Women with this syndrome have a very high risk of colon cancer and also have an increased risk of developing cancer of the uterus (endometrial cancer) and ovarian cancer. Many different genes can cause this syndrome. They include MLH1\n, MSH2\n, MSH6\n, PMS2, \nand EPCAM.\n The lifetime risk of ovarian cancer in women with hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer is about 10%. Up to 1% of all ovarian epithelial cancers occur in women with this syndrome. Another name for HNPCC is Lynch syndrome.\n \n  Peutz-Jeghers syndrome\n \n  People with this rare genetic syndrome develop polyps in the stomach and intestine while they are teenagers. They also have a high risk of cancer, particularly cancers of the digestive tract (esophagus, stomach, small intestine, colon). Women with this syndrome have an increased risk of ovarian cancer, including both epithelial ovarian cancer and a type of stromal tumor called  (SCTAT). This syndrome is caused by mutations in the gene STK11\n.\n \n  MUTYH-associated polyposis\n \n  People with this syndrome develop polyps in the colon and small intestine and have a high risk of colon cancer. They are also more likely to develop other cancers, including cancers of the ovary and bladder. This syndrome is caused by mutations in the gene MUTYH\n.\n \n  Other genes associated with hereditary ovarian cancer\n \n  Besides the gene mutations mentioned above, there are other genes linked to ovarian cancer. These include ATM, BRIP1, RAD51C, RAD51D\n, and PALB2\n. Some of these genes are also associated with cancers such as breast and pancreas.\n \n  Using fertility treatment\n \n  Fertility treatment with in vitro fertilization (IVF) seems to increase the risk of the type of ovarian tumors known as \"borderline\" or \"low malignant potential\"\n    (described in What Is Ovarian Cancer?). Other studies, however, have not shown an increased risk of invasive ovarian cancer with fertility drugs.\n    If you are taking fertility drugs, you should discuss the potential risks with your doctor.\n \n  Having had breast cancer\n \n  If you have had breast cancer, you might also have an increased risk of developing ovarian cancer. There are several reasons for this. Some of the reproductive risk factors for ovarian cancer may also affect breast cancer risk. The risk of ovarian cancer after breast cancer is highest\n    in those women with a family history of breast cancer. A strong family history of breast cancer may be caused by an inherited mutation in the BRCA1\n or BRCA2\n genes and hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome, which is linked to an increased risk of ovarian cancer.\n \n  Smoking\n \n  Smoking doesn’t increase the risk of ovarian cancer overall, but it is linked to an increased risk for the mucinous type.\n \n  Factors with unclear effects on ovarian cancer risk\n \n  Androgens\n \n  Androgens, such as testosterone, are male hormones. There appears to be a link between certain androgens and specific types of ovarian cancer, \n   but further studies of the role of androgens in ovarian cancer are needed.\n \n  Talcum powder\n \n  It has been suggested that talcum powder might cause cancer in the ovaries if the powder particles (applied to the genital area or on sanitary napkins, diaphragms, or condoms) were to travel through the vagina, uterus, and fallopian tubes to the ovary.\n \n  Many studies in women have looked at the possible link between talcum powder and cancer of the ovary. Findings have been mixed, with some studies reporting a slightly increased risk and some reporting no increase. Many case-control studies have found a small increase in risk. But these types of studies can be biased because they often rely on a person’s memory of talc use many years earlier.  One prospective cohort study, which would not have the same type of potential bias, has not found an increased risk. A second found a modest increase in risk of one type of ovarian cancer.\n \n  For any individual woman, if there is an increased risk, the overall increase is likely to very be small. Still, talc is widely used in many products, so it is important to determine if the increased risk is real. Research in this area continues.\n \n  Diet\n \n  Some studies have shown a reduced rate of ovarian cancer in women who ate a diet high in vegetables or a low fat diet, but other studies disagree. The American Cancer Society recommends following a healthy eating pattern that includes plenty of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, and that limits or avoids red and processed meats, sugary drinks, and highly processed foods. \n    Even though the effect of these dietary recommendations on ovarian cancer risk remains uncertain, following them can help prevent several other diseases, including some other types of cancer.\n \n  Factors that can lower risk of ovarian cancer\n \n  Pregnancy and breastfeeding\n \n  Women who have been pregnant and carried it to term before age 26 have a lower risk of ovarian cancer than women who have not. The risk goes down with each full-term pregnancy. Breastfeeding may lower the risk even further.\n \n  Birth control\n \n  Women who have used oral contraceptives (also known as  or ) have a lower risk of ovarian cancer. The risk is lower the longer the pills are used. This lower risk continues for many years after the pill is stopped. Other forms of birth control such as tubal ligation (having fallopian tubes tied) and short use of IUDs (intrauterine devices) have also been associated with a lower risk of ovarian cancer.\n \n  A hysterectomy (removing the uterus without removing the ovaries) also seems to reduce the risk of getting ovarian cancer by about one-third.\n   \n",

        "text": "What Causes Ovarian Cancer?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n \n \n  \nWe don’t yet know exactly what causes most ovarian cancers. As discussed in Ovarian Cancer Risk Factors, we do know some factors that make a woman more likely to develop epithelial ovarian cancer. Much less is known about risk factors for germ cell and stromal tumors of the ovaries.\n \n  The most recent and important finding about the cause of ovarian cancer is that it starts in cells at the tail ends of the fallopian tubes and not necessarily in the ovary itself. This new information may open more research studies looking at preventing and screening for this type of cancer. \n    \n \n  There are many theories about the causes of ovarian cancer. Some of them came from looking at the things that change the risk of ovarian cancer. For example, pregnancy and taking birth control pills both lower the risk of ovarian cancer. Since both of these things reduce the number of times the ovary releases an egg (ovulation), some researchers think that there may be some relationship between ovulation and the risk of developing ovarian cancer.\n \n  Also, we know that tubal ligation and hysterectomy lower the risk of ovarian cancer. One theory to explain this is that some cancer-causing substances may enter the body through the vagina and pass through the uterus and fallopian tubes to reach the ovaries. This would explain how removing the uterus or blocking the fallopian tubes affects ovarian cancer risk.\n \n  Another theory is that male hormones (androgens) can cause ovarian cancer.\n \n  Gene changes related to ovarian cancer\n \n  Researchers have made great progress in understanding how certain mutations (changes) in DNA can cause normal cells to become cancerous. DNA is the chemical that carries the instructions for nearly everything our cells do. We usually look like our parents because they are the source of our DNA. However, DNA affects more than the way we look. Some genes (parts of our DNA) contain instructions for controlling when our cells grow and divide. Mutations in these genes can lead to the development of cancer.\n \n  Inherited genetic mutations\n \n  A small portion of ovarian cancers occur in women with inherited  mutations linked to an increased risk of ovarian cancer. These include mutations in the BRCA1\n and BRCA2\n genes, as well as the genes related to other family cancer syndromes linked to an increased risk of ovarian cancer, such as PTEN \n(PTEN tumor hamartoma syndrome), STK11\n (Peutz-Jeghers syndrome), MUTYH\n (MUTYH-associated polyposis, and the many genes that can cause hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer (MLH1\n, MLH3\n, MSH2\n, MSH6\n, TGFBR2\n, PMS1\n, and PMS2).\n \n \n  Genetic tests can detect  mutations associated with these inherited syndromes. If you have a family history of cancers linked to these syndromes, such as breast and ovarian cancers, thyroid and ovarian cancer, and/or colorectal and endometrial (uterine) cancer, you might want to ask your doctor about genetic counseling and testing. The American Cancer Society recommends discussing genetic testing with a qualified cancer genetics professional before any genetic testing is done. For more on this, see Genetics and Cancer.\n \n  Acquired genetic changes\n \n  Most mutations related to ovarian cancer are not inherited but instead occur during a woman's life and are called acquired mutations. In some cancers, these types of mutations  leading to the development of cancer may result from radiation or cancer-causing chemicals, but there is no evidence for this in ovarian cancer. So far, studies haven’t been able to specifically link any single chemical in the environment or in our diets to mutations that cause ovarian cancer. The cause of most acquired mutations remains unknown.\n \n  Most ovarian cancers have several acquired mutations. Research has suggested that tests to identify acquired mutations in ovarian cancers, like theTP53 tumor suppressor geneor theHER2 oncogene,can help predict a woman's prognosis. The role of these tests is still not certain, and more research is needed.\n"

So far, what is known about risk factors has not translated into practical ways to prevent most cases of ovarian cancer.\n \n  There are several ways you can reduce your risk of developing the most common type of ovarian cancer, epithelial ovarian cancer. Much less is known about ways to lower the risk of developing germ cell and stromal tumors of the ovaries, so this information does not apply to those types. It is important to realize that some of these strategies lower your risk only slightly, while others lower it much more. Some strategies are easily followed, and others require surgery. If you are concerned about your risk of ovarian cancer, talk to your health care professionals. They can help you consider these ideas as they apply to your own situation.\n \n  Avoiding certain risk factors\n \n  Some risk factors for ovarian cancer, like getting older or having a family history, cannot be changed. But women might be able to lower their risk slightly by avoiding other risk factors, for example, by staying at a healthy weight, or not taking hormone replacement therapy after menopause. See Risk Factors for Ovarian Cancer to learn more.\n \n  Oral contraceptives\n \n  Using oral contraceptives (birth control pills) decreases the risk of developing ovarian cancer for average risk women and BRCA mutation carriers\n   , especially among women who use them for several years. Women who used oral contraceptives for 5 or more years have about a 50% lower risk of developing ovarian cancer compared with women who never used oral contraceptives. Still, birth control pills do have some serious risks and side effects such as slightly increasing breast cancer risk. Women considering taking these drugs for any reason should first discuss the possible risks and benefits with their doctor.\n \n  Gynecologic surgery\n \n  Both tubal ligation and hysterectomy may reduce the chance of developing certain types of ovarian cancer, but experts agree that these operations should only be done for valid medical reasons -- not for their effect on ovarian cancer risk.\n \n  If you are going to have a hysterectomy for a valid medical reason and you have a strong family history of ovarian or breast cancer, you may want to consider having both ovaries and fallopian tubes removed (called a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy\n) as part of that procedure.\n \n  Even if you don’t have an increased risk of ovarian cancer, some doctors recommend that the ovaries be removed with the uterus if a woman has already gone through menopause or is close to menopause. If you are older than 40 and you are going to have a hysterectomy, you should discuss the potential risks and benefits of having your ovaries removed with your doctor.\n \n  Another option for average risk women who do not wish to have their ovaries removed because they don’t want to lose ovarian function (and go through menopause early) is to have just the fallopian tubes removed (a bilateral salpingectomy) along with the uterus (a hysterectomy). They may choose to have their ovaries removed later. This has not been studied as well as removing both the ovaries and fallopian tubes at the same time, but there is enough information that it may be considered an option to reduce ovarian cancer risk in average risk women. \n    \n \n  Prevention strategies for women with a family history of ovarian cancer or BRCA mutation\n \n  If your family history suggests that you (or a close relative) might have a syndrome linked with a high risk of ovarian cancer, you might want to consider genetic counseling and testing. During genetic counseling (by a genetic counselor or other health care professional with training in genetic risk evaluation), your personal medical and family history is reviewed. This can help predict whether you are likely to have one of the gene mutations associated with an increased ovarian cancer risk.\n \n  The counselor will also discuss the benefits and potential drawbacks of genetic testing with you. Genetic testing can help determine if you or members of your family carry certain gene mutations that cause a high risk of ovarian cancer. Still, the results are not always clear, and a genetic counselor can help you sort out what the results mean to you.\n \n  For some women with a strong family history of ovarian cancer, knowing they do not have a mutation that increases their ovarian cancer risk can be a great relief for them and their children. Knowing that you do have such a mutation can be stressful, but many women find this information very helpful in making important decisions about certain prevention strategies for them and their children. See Genetics and Cancer to learn more.\n \n  Using oral contraceptives is one way that high risk women (women with BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations) can reduce their risk of developing ovarian cancer.  But birth control pills can increase breast cancer risk in women with or without these mutations.\n    This increased risk appears highest while women are actively taking birth control pills but can continue even after stopping them.  Research is continuing to find out more about the risks and benefits of oral contraceptives for women at high ovarian and breast cancer risk.\n \n  Tubal ligation may also effectively reduce the risk of ovarian cancer in women who have BRCA1\n or BRCA2\n mutations.  Usually this type of surgery is not done alone and is typically done for reasons other than ovarian cancer prevention. \n \n  Sometimes a woman may want to consider having both ovaries and fallopian tubes removed (called a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy) to reduce her risk of ovarian cancer before cancer is even suspected. If the ovaries are removed to prevent ovarian cancer, the surgery is called risk-reducing\n or prophylactic\n. Generally, salpingo-oophorectomy may be recommended  for  high-risk women after they have finished having children. This operation lowers ovarian cancer risk a great deal but does not entirely eliminate it. That’s because some women who have a high risk of ovarian cancer already have a cancer at the time of surgery. These cancers can be so small that they are only found when the ovaries and fallopian tubes are looked at in the lab after they are removed. Also, women with BRCA1\n or BRCA2\n gene mutations have an increased risk of primary peritoneal carcinoma. Although the risk is low, this cancer can still develop after the ovaries and fallopian tubes are removed.\n \n  The risk of fallopian tube cancer is also increased in women with mutations in BRCA1\n or BRCA2.\n Sometimes early fallopian tube cancers are found unexpectedly when the fallopian tubes are removed as a part of a risk-reducing surgery. In fact, some cancers that were thought to be ovarian or primary peritoneal cancers may have actually started in the fallopian tubes. That is why experts recommend that women at high risk of ovarian cancer who are having their ovaries removed should have their fallopian tubes completely removed as well (salpingo-oophorectomy).\n \n  Research has shown that premenopausal women who have BRCA\n gene mutations and have had their ovaries removed reduce their risk of breast cancer as well as their risk of ovarian cancer. The risk of ovarian cancer is reduced by 85% to 95%, and the risk of breast cancer cut by 50% or more.\n  \n  Some women who have a high risk of ovarian cancer due to BRCA\n gene mutations feel that having their ovaries and fallopian tubes removed is not right for them. Often doctors recommend that those women have screening tests to try to find ovarian cancer early. \n \n \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            Written by\n        \n\n    \n        \n            References\n        \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n    \n            \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n            \n\n            The American Cancer Society medical and editorial content team\nOur team is made up of doctors and oncology certified nurses with deep knowledge of cancer care as well as journalists, editors, and translators with extensive experience in medical writing.\n\n        \n\n    \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n            \n        \n\n    \n        \n    \n            \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n        \n            \n            Brohet RM, Goldgar DE, Easton DF, et al.

        "text": "Can Ovarian Cancer Be Found Early?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n \n \n  \nOnly about 20% of ovarian cancers are found at an early stage. When ovarian cancer is found early, about 94% of patients live longer than 5 years after diagnosis.  \n \n  Ways to find ovarian cancer early\n \n  Regular women's health exams\n \n  During a pelvic exam, the health care professional feels the ovaries and uterus for size, shape, and consistency. A pelvic exam can be useful because it can find some female cancers at an early stage, but most early ovarian tumors are difficult or impossible  to feel. Pelvic exams may, however, help find other cancers or female conditions. Women should discuss the need for these exams with their doctor.\n \n  Screening tests used for cervical cancer, such as a Pap test or HPV (human papillomavirus) test aren’t effective tests for ovarian cancer. Rarely, ovarian cancers are found through Pap tests, but usually they are at an advanced stage.\n \n  See a doctor if you have symptoms\n \n  Early cancers of the ovaries often cause no symptoms. Symptoms of ovarian cancer can also be caused by other, less serious conditions.  By the time ovarian cancer is considered as a possible cause of these symptoms, it usually has already spread. Also, some types of ovarian cancer can rapidly spread to nearby organs. Prompt attention to symptoms may improve the odds of early diagnosis and successful treatment. If you have symptoms similar to those of ovarian cancer almost daily for more than a few weeks, report them right away to your health care professional.\n \n  Screening tests for ovarian cancer\n \n  Screening tests and exams are used to detect a disease, like cancer, in people who don’t have any symptoms. (For example, a mammogram can often detect breast cancer in its earliest stage, even before a doctor can feel the cancer.) \n \n  There has been a lot of research to develop a screening test for ovarian cancer, but there hasn’t been much success so far. The 2 tests used most often (in addition to a complete pelvic exam) to screen for ovarian cancer are transvaginal ultrasound\n (TVUS) and the CA-125\n blood test. \n \n   \n    is a test that uses sound waves to look at the uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries by putting an ultrasound wand into the vagina. It can help find a mass (tumor) in the ovary, but it can't actually tell if a mass is cancer or benign. When it is used for screening, most of the masses found are not cancer.\n \n   TheCA-125 blood testmeasures the amount of a protein called CA-125 in the blood. Many women with ovarian cancer have high levels of CA-125. This test can be useful as a tumor marker to help guide treatment in women known to have ovarian cancer, because a high level often goes down if treatment is working. But checking CA-125 levels has not been found to be as useful as a screening test for ovarian cancer. The problem with using this test for ovarian cancer screening is that high levels of CA-125 is more often caused by common conditions such as endometriosis and pelvic inflammatory disease. Also, not everyone who has ovarian cancer has a high CA-125 level. When someone who is not known to have ovarian cancer has an abnormal CA-125 level, the doctor might repeat the test (to make sure the result is correct) and may consider ordering a transvaginal ultrasound test.\n \n  \n \n  Better ways to screen for ovarian cancer are being researched but currently there are no reliable screening tests. Hopefully, improvements in screening tests will eventually lead to fewer deaths from ovarian cancer. \n \n  If you're at average risk\n \n   There are no recommended screening tests for ovarian cancer for women who do not have symptoms and are not at high risk of developing ovarian cancer. In studies of women at average risk of ovarian cancer, using TVUS and CA-125 for screening led to more testing and sometimes more surgeries, but did not lower the number of deaths caused by ovarian cancer. For that reason, no major medical or professional organization recommends the routine use of TVUS or the CA-125 blood test to screen for ovarian cancer in women at average risk.\n     \n \n  If you're at high risk \n      \n  Some organizations state that TVUS and CA-125 may be offered to screen women who have a high risk of ovarian cancer due to an inherited genetic syndrome such as Lynch syndrome, BRCA gene mutations or a strong family history of breast and ovarian cancer. Still, even in these women, it has not been proven that using these tests for screening lowers their chances of dying from ovarian cancer.\n    \n  \n  Screening tests for germ cell tumors/stromal tumors\n \n  There are no recommended screening tests for germ cell tumors or stromal tumors. Some germ cell cancers release certain protein markers such as human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) into the blood. After these tumors have been treated by surgery and chemotherapy, blood tests for these markers can be used to see if treatment is working and to determine if the cancer is coming back.\n"

        "text": "Tests for Ovarian Cancer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n \n \n  \n If your doctor finds something suspicious during a pelvic exam, or if you have symptoms that might be due to ovarian cancer, your doctor will recommend exams and tests to find the cause.\n \n  Medical history and physical exam\n \n  Your doctor will ask about your medical history to learn about possible risk factors, including your family history. You will also be asked if you’re having any symptoms, when they started, and how long you've had them. Your doctor will likely do a pelvic exam to check for an enlarged ovary or signs of fluid in the abdomen (which is called ascites\n).\n \n  If there is reason to suspect you have ovarian cancer based on your symptoms and/or physical exam, your doctor will order some tests to check further.\n \n  Consultation with a specialist\n \n  If the results of your pelvic exam or other tests suggest that you have ovarian cancer, you will need a doctor or surgeon who specializes in treating women with this type of cancer. A  is an obstetrician/gynecologist who is specially trained in treating cancers of the female reproductive system. Treatment by a gynecologic oncologist helps ensure that you get the best kind of surgery for your cancer. It has also has been shown to help patients with ovarian cancer live longer. Anyone suspected of having ovarian cancer should see this type of specialist before having surgery.\n \n  Imaging tests\n \n  Doctors use imaging tests to take pictures of the inside of your body. Imaging tests can show whether a pelvic mass is present, but they cannot confirm that the mass is a cancer. These tests are also useful if your doctor is looking to see if ovarian cancer has spread (metastasized) to other tissues and organs.\n \n  Ultrasound\n \n  Ultrasound (ultrasonography) uses sound waves to create an image on a video screen. Sound waves are released from a small probe placed in the woman's vagina and a small microphone-like instrument called a transducer gives off sound waves and picks up the echoes as they bounce off organs. A computer turns these echoes into an image on the screen.\n \n  Ultrasound is often the first test done if a problem with the ovaries is suspected. It can be used to find an ovarian tumor and to check if it is a solid mass (tumor) or a fluid-filled cyst. It can also be used to get a better look at the ovary to see how big it is and how it looks inside. This helps the doctor decide which masses or cysts are more worrisome.\n \n  Computed tomography (CT) scans\n \n  The CT scan is an x-ray test that makes detailed cross-sectional images of your body. The test can help tell if ovarian cancer has spread to other organs. \n  \n  CT scans do not show small ovarian tumors well, but they can see larger tumors, and may be able to see if the tumor is growing into nearby structures. A CT scan may also find enlarged lymph nodes, signs of cancer spread to liver or other organs, or signs that an ovarian tumor is affecting your kidneys or bladder.\n   \n  CT scans are not usually used to biopsy an ovarian tumor (see biopsy in the section \"Other tests\"), but they can be used to biopsy a suspected metastasis (area of spread). For this procedure, called a CT-guided needle biopsy\n, the patient stays on the CT scanning table, while a radiologist moves a biopsy needle toward  the mass. CT scans are repeated until the doctors are confident that the needle is in the mass. A fine needle biopsy sample (tiny fragment of tissue) or a core needle biopsy sample (a thin cylinder of tissue about ½ inch long and less than 1/8 inch in diameter) is removed and examined in the lab.\n \n  Barium enema x-ray\n \n  A barium enema is a test to see if the cancer has invaded the colon (large intestine) or rectum. This test is rarely used for women with ovarian cancer. Colonoscopy may be done instead.\n \n  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans\n \n  MRI scans also create cross-section pictures of your insides. But MRI uses strong magnets to make the images – not x-rays. A contrast material called gadolinium may be injected into a vein before the scan to see details better.\n \n  MRI scans are not used often to look for ovarian cancer, but they are particularly helpful to examine the brain and spinal cord where cancer could spread. \n \n  Chest x-ray\n \n  An x-ray might be done to determine whether ovarian cancer has spread (metastasized) to the lungs. This spread may cause one or more tumors in the lungs and more often causes fluid to collect around the lungs. This fluid, called a pleural effusion\n, can be seen with chest x-rays as well as other types of scans.\n \n  Positron emission tomography (PET) scan\n \n  For a PET scan, radioactive glucose (sugar) is given to look for the cancer. Body cells take in different amounts of the sugar, depending on how fast they are growing. Cancer cells, which grow quickly, are more likely to take up larger amounts of the sugar than normal cells. A special camera is used to create a picture of areas of radioactivity in the body. \n \n  The picture from a PET scan is not as detailed as a CT or MRI scan, but it provides helpful information about whether abnormal areas seen on these other tests are likely to be cancer or not.\n \n  If you have already been diagnosed with cancer, your doctor may use this test to see if the cancer has spread to lymph nodes or other parts of the body. A PET scan can also be useful if your doctor thinks the cancer may have spread but doesn’t know where. \n \n   Some machines can do both a PET and CT scan at the same time. This lets the doctor compare areas of higher radioactivity on the PET scan with the more detailed picture of that area on the CT scan. \n \n  PET scans can help find cancer when it has spread, but are not used often to look for ovarian cancer. \n \n  Other tests\n \n  Laparoscopy\n \n  This procedure uses a thin, lighted tube through which a doctor can look at the ovaries and other pelvic organs and tissues in the area. The tube is inserted through a small incision (cut) in the lower abdomen and sends the images of the pelvis or abdomen to a video monitor. Laparoscopy provides a view of organs that can help plan surgery or other treatments and can help doctors confirm the stage (how far the tumor has spread) of the cancer. Also, doctors can manipulate small instruments through the laparoscopic incision(s) to perform biopsies.\n \n  Colonoscopy\n \n  A colonoscopy is a way to examine the inside of the large intestine (colon). The doctor looks at the entire length of the colon and rectum with a colonoscope, a thin, flexible, lighted tube with a small video camera on the end. It is inserted through the anus and into the rectum and the colon. Any abnormal areas seen can by biopsied. This procedure is more commonly used to look for colorectal cancer.\n   \n  Biopsy\n \n  The only way to determine for certain if a growth is cancer is to remove a piece of it and examine it in the lab. This procedure is called a biopsy\n. For ovarian cancer, the biopsy is most commonly done by removing the tumor during surgery.\n \n  In rare cases, a suspected ovarian cancer may be biopsied during a laparoscopy procedure or with a needle placed directly into the tumor through the skin of the abdomen. Usually the needle will be guided by either ultrasound or CT scan. This is only done if you cannot have surgery because of advanced cancer or some other serious medical condition, because there is concern that a biopsy could spread the cancer.\n \n  If you have ascites (fluid buildup inside the abdomen), samples of the fluid can also be used to diagnose the cancer. In this procedure, called paracentesis\n, the skin of the abdomen is numbed and a needle attached to a syringe is passed through the abdominal wall into the fluid in the abdominal cavity. Ultrasound may be used to guide the needle. The fluid is taken up into the syringe and then sent for analysis to see if it contains cancer cells.\n \n  In all these procedures, the tissue or fluid obtained is sent to the lab. There it is examined by a pathologist,\n a doctor who specialize in diagnosing and classifying diseases by examining cells under a microscope and using other lab tests.\n \n  Blood tests\n \n  Your doctor will order blood count tests to make sure you have enough red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets (cells that help stop bleeding). There will also be tests to measure your kidney and liver function as well as your general health. \n \n  The doctor will also order a CA-125 test. Women who have a highCA-125 levelare often referred to a gynecologic oncologist, but any woman with suspected ovarian cancer should see a gynecologic oncologist, as well.\n \n  Some germ cell cancers can cause elevated blood levels of the tumor markers human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG), alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), and/or lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). These may be checked if your doctor suspects that your ovarian tumor could be a germ cell tumor.\n \n  Some ovarian stromal tumors cause the blood levels of a substance called inhibin\n and hormones such as estrogen and testosterone to go up. These levels may be checked if your doctor suspects that you have this type of tumor.\n \n  Genetic counseling and testing if you have ovarian cancer\n \n  If you have been diagnosed with an epithelial ovarian cancer, your doctor will likely recommend that you get genetic counseling and genetic testing for certain inherited gene changes,  even if you do not have a family history of cancer. The most common mutations found are in the BRCA1\n and BRCA2\n genes, but some ovarian cancers are linked to mutations in other genes, such as ATM\n, BRIP1, RAD51C/RAD51D, MSH2, MLH1, MSH6\n, or PMS6\n. \n  \n  Genetic testing to look for inherited mutations can be helpful in several ways \n \n   \n   If you are found to have a gene mutation, you might be more likely to get other types of cancer as well. You might benefit from doing what you can to lower your risk of these cancers, as well as having tests to find them early.\n \n   If you have a gene mutation, your family members (blood relatives) might also have it, so they can decide if they want to be tested to learn more about their cancer risk.\n \n   If you have a BRCA1\n or BRCA2\n mutation, at some point you might benefit from treatment with targeted drugs called .\n \n   Even if you do not have any of the gene mutations listed above, your tumor might be tested for some of these abnormal genes because it might give you more options for treatment.\n \n  \n \n  You may have heard about some home-based genetic tests. There is a concern that these tests are promoted by companies without giving full information. For example, a test for a small number of BRCA1\n and BRCA2\n gene mutations has been approved by the FDA. However, there are more than 1,000 known BRCA\n mutations, and the ones included in the approved test are not the most common ones. This means there are many BRCA\n mutations that would not be detected by this test. \n \n  A genetic counselor or other qualified medical professional can help you understand the risks, benefits, and possible limits of what genetic testing can tell you. This can help you decide if testing is right for you, and which testing is best. \n \n  To learn more about genetic testing, see Should I Get Genetic Testing for Cancer Risk?\n \n  Molecular tests for gene changes\n \n  In some cases of ovarian cancer, doctors might look for specific gene changes in the cancer cells (not from samples of your blood or saliva) that could mean certain targeted or immunotherapy drugs might help treat the cancer. These molecular tests can be done on a piece of the cancer taken during a biopsy or surgery for ovarian cancer.\n \n  BRCA genes are normally involved in DNA repair and mutations in these genes can keep DNA broken and the cells unable to work correctly. This can cause cells to grow out of control and turn into cancer. Some\n     ovarian cancers have BRCA gene mutations.\n \n   Women who have clear cell, endometrioid, or mucinous ovarian cancer might have their tumor tested to see if it shows high levels of gene changes called (MSI). Testing might also be done to see if the cancer cells have changes in any of the mismatch repair (MMR) genes (MLH1\n, MSH2\n, MSH6\n, and PMS2\n).  \n \n  Changes in MSI or in MMR genes (or both) are often seen in people with Lynch syndrome (HNPCC). Up to 10%\n     of all ovarian epithelial cancers have changes in these genes.\n \n  There are 2 possible reasons to test ovarian cancers for MSI or for MMR gene changes:\n \n   \n   To identify patients who should be tested for Lynch syndrome. A diagnosis of Lynch syndrome can help schedule other cancer screenings for the patient such as for endometrial or colon cancer. Also, if a patient has Lynch syndrome, their relatives could also have it, and may want to be tested for it.\n \n   To determine treatment options for ovarian cancer. Ovarian cancers that have certain MSI or MMR gene changes might be treated with immunotherapy drugs. \n \n  \n \n  : Some ovarian cancers might be tested for changes in one of the NTRK genes. Cells with these gene changes can lead to abnormal cell growth and cancer. Larotrectinib (Vitrakvi) and entrectinib (Rozlytrek) are targeted drugs that stop the proteins made by the abnormal NTRK genes. The number of ovarian cancers that have this mutation is very small, but this may be an option for some women.\n    \n"

        "text": "Ovarian Cancer Stages\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n \n \n  \nAfter a woman is diagnosed with ovarian cancer, doctors will try to figure out if it has spread, and if so, how far. This process is called staging\n. The stage of a cancer describes how much cancer is in the body. It helps determine how serious the cancer is and how best to treat it. Doctors also use a cancer's stage when talking about survival statistics.\n \n  Ovarian cancer stages range from stage I (1) through IV (4). As a rule, the lower the number, the less the cancer has spread. A higher number, such as stage IV, means cancer has spread more.  Although each person’s cancer experience is unique, cancers with similar stages tend to have a similar outlook and are often treated in much the same way.\n \n  One of the goals of surgery for ovarian cancer is to take tissue samples for diagnosis and staging. To stage the cancer, samples of tissues are taken from different parts of the pelvis and abdomen and examined in the lab.\n \n  How is the stage determined?\n \n  The 2 systems used for staging ovarian cancer, the \nand the (are basically the same.\n \n  They both use 3 factors to stage (classify) this cancer :\n \n   \n   The extent (size) of thetumorHas the cancer spread outside the ovary or fallopian tube?  Has the cancer reached nearby pelvic organs like the uterus or bladder?\n \n   The spread to nearby lymph nodes Has the cancer spread to the lymph nodes in the pelvis or around the aorta (the main artery that runs from the heart down along the back of the abdomen and pelvis)? Also called para-aortic lymph nodes.\n \n   The spread (metastasis)to distant sites Has the cancer spread to fluid around the lungs (malignant pleural effusion) or to distant organs such as the liver or bones?\n \n  \n \n  Numbers or letters after T, N, and M provide more details about each of these factors. Higher numbers mean the cancer is more advanced. Once a person’s T, N, and M categories have been determined, this information is combined in a process called stage grouping\n to assign an overall stage. \n \n  The staging system in the table below uses the pathologic stage (also called the \nsurgical stage). It is determined by examining tissue removed during an operation. This is also known as . Sometimes, if surgery is not possible right away, the cancer will be given a clinical stage instead. This is based on the results of a physical exam, biopsy, and imaging tests done  surgery. For more information see Cancer Staging. \n \n  The system described below is the most recent AJCC system effective January 2018. It is the staging system for ovarian cancer, fallopian tube cancer, and primary peritoneal cancer. \n \n  Cancer staging can be complex, so ask your doctor to explain it to you in a way you understand.  \n \n  \n \n  * The following additional categories are not described in the table above:\n \n   \n    Main tumor cannot be assessed due to lack of information\n \n    No evidence of a primary tumor.\n \n    Regional lymph nodes cannot be assessed due to lack of information. \n"

        "text": "Surgery for Ovarian Cancer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n \n \n  \nSurgery is the main treatment for most ovarian cancers. How much surgery you have depends on how far your cancer has spread and on your general health. For women of childbearing age who have certain kinds of tumors and whose cancer is in the earliest stage, it may be possible to treat the disease without removing both ovaries and the uterus.\n \n  Surgery for epithelial ovarian cancer\n \n  For epithelial ovarian cancer, surgery has 2 main goals: staging and debulking. If your cancer isn’t properly staged and debulked, you may need to have more surgery later, so it’s important that this surgery is done by a specialist who’s trained and experienced in ovarian cancer surgery, like a gynecologic oncologist. \n   \n  Staging epithelial ovarian cancer\n \n  The first goal of ovarian cancer surgery is to stage\n the cancer − to see how far the cancer has spread from the ovary. Usually this means removing the uterus (this operation is called a hysterectomy\n), along with both ovaries and fallopian tubes (this is called a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy\n or BSO). In addition, the omentum is also removed (an omentectomy\n). The omentum is a layer of fatty tissue that covers the abdominal contents like an apron, and ovarian cancer sometimes spreads to this area. Some lymph nodes in the pelvis and abdomen might also be biopsied (taken out to see if the cancer has spread from the ovary).\n \n  If there is fluid in the pelvis or abdominal cavity, it will be removed for testing. The surgeon may \"wash\" the abdominal cavity with salt water (saline) and send that fluid to the lab for testing. He or she may also take biopsies from different areas inside the abdomen and pelvis. All the tissue and fluid samples taken during the operation are sent to a lab to look for cancer cells. Staging is very important because ovarian cancers at different stages are treated differently. If the staging isn't done correctly, the doctor may not be able to decide on the best treatment.\n \n  Debulking epithelial ovarian cancer\n \n  The other important goal of ovarian cancer surgery is to remove as much of the tumor as possible − this is called debulking.\n Debulking is very important when ovarian cancer has already spread  throughout the abdomen (belly) at the time of surgery. The aim of debulking surgery is to leave behind no visible cancer or no tumors larger than 1 cm (less than 1/2 an inch). This is called optimally debulked\n. \n \n  In some cases, other organs might be affected by debulking:\n \n   \n   Sometimes the surgeon will need to remove a piece of colon to debulk the cancer properly. In some cases, a piece of colon is removed and then the 2 ends that remain are sewn back together. In other cases, though, the ends can’t be sewn back together right away. Instead, the top end of the colon is attached to an opening (stoma) in the skin of the abdomen to allow body wastes to get out. This is known as a colostomy. \nMost often, this is only temporary, and the ends of the colon can be reattached later in another operation. For more information, see Colostomy Guide.\n \n   Sometimes, a part of the small intestine may need to be removed. Just like with the colon, the small intestine can either be reconnected (which is most common) or an \nileostomy might be made. This is usually temporary, but will need special care, so ask your doctor if this is a possibility before having surgery. See Ileostomy Guide to learn more.\n \n   Debulking surgery might also mean removing a piece of the bladder. If this happens, a catheter (to empty the bladder) will be placed during surgery. This will be left in place until the bladder recovers enough to be able to empty on its own. Then, the catheter can be removed.\n \n   Debulking might also require removing the spleen and/or the gallbladder, as well as part of the stomach, liver, and/or pancreas.\n \n  \n \n  If both ovaries and/or the uterus are removed, you will not be able to become pregnant. It also means that you will go into menopause if you haven’t done so already. Most women will stay in the hospital for 3 to 7 days after the operation and can resume their usual activities within 4 to 6 weeks.\n \n  Intraoperative imaging\n \n  To know where the ovarian cancer is in your body to remove it, the surgeon typically uses your imaging tests done before surgery as well as a bright light and feeling for the tumors during the operation. Sometimes, tumors that are not easily seen or felt by hand might be missed. To help find these tumors,  might be used. Intraoperative imaging uses a special imaging machine in the operating room during the surgery. For women with ovarian cancer, a florescent drug called pafolacianine (Cytalux) will be injected into your body a few hours before surgery and will attach to a specific protein found on ovarian cancer cells. During surgery, the imaging machine will give off near-infrared florescent light that will cause the \"hidden\" tumors, where the florescent drug has attached, to light up so the surgeon can see them. This procedure can help make sure all the cancer was removed. \n \n  The most common side effects from pafolacianine (Cytalux) are belly pain, heartburn, itching, chest pain, nausea, vomiting, and flushing. \n \n  Your doctor will probably ask you to avoid taking any supplements that have folic acid in them for a few days before the procedure so they don’t disturb the test. \n \n  Surgery for ovarian germ cell tumors and ovarian stromal tumors\n \n  For germ cell tumors and stromal tumors, the main goal of surgery is to remove the cancer.\n \n  Most ovarian germ cell tumors are treated with a hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. If the cancer is in only one ovary and you still want to be able to have children, only the ovary containing the cancer and the fallopian tube on the same side are removed (leaving behind the other ovary and fallopian tube and the uterus).\n \n  Ovarian stromal tumors are often confined to just one ovary, so surgery may just remove that ovary. If the cancer has spread, more tissue may need to be removed. This could mean a hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and even debulking surgery.\n \n  Sometimes, after child bearing is finished, surgery to remove the other ovary, the other fallopian tube, and the uterus may be recommended, for both germ cell and stromal ovarian tumors. \n     \n \n \n\n\n\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n\n    \n    \n    \n\n    \n        More information about Surgery\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n    \n    \n    \n\n    \n        For more general information about  surgery as a treatment for cancer, see Cancer Surgery\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n    \n    \n    \n\n    \n        To learn about some of the side effects listed here and how to manage them, see Managing Cancer-related Side Effects.\n"

        "text": "Chemotherapy (chemo) is the use of drugs to treat cancer. Most often, chemo is a systemic treatment, meaning the drugs enter the bloodstream and reach almost all areas of the body. Chemo can be useful to kill very small amounts of cancer cells that may still be around after surgery, for cancers that have metastasized (spread), or to shrink very large tumors to make surgery easier. Most of the time, chemo uses drugs that are injected into a vein (IV) or given by mouth. In some cases, chemotherapy may also be injected through a catheter (thin tube) directly into the abdominal cavity. This is called intraperitoneal (IP) chemotherapy\n. \n \n  Chemotherapy for epithelial ovarian cancer\n \n  Chemo for ovarian cancer usually involves getting two different types of drugs together. Getting a combination of drugs instead of just one drug alone seems to work better as a first treatment for ovarian cancer. Usually, the combination includes a type of chemo drug called a platinum compound\n (usually cisplatin or carboplatin), and another type of chemo drug called a taxane\n, such as paclitaxel (Taxol) or docetaxel (Taxotere). These drugs are usually given as an IV (put into a vein) every 3 to 4 weeks. \n   \n  The typical course of chemo for epithelial ovarian cancer involves 3 to 6 cycles of treatment, depending on the stage and type of ovarian cancer. A cycle is a schedule of regular doses of a drug, followed by a rest period. Different drugs have varying cycles; your doctor will let you know what schedule is planned for your chemo.\n \n  Epithelial ovarian cancer often shrinks or even seems to go away with chemo, but the cancer cells may eventually begin to grow again. If the first chemo seemed to work well and the cancer stayed away for at least 6 to 12 months, it can be treated with the same chemotherapy used the first time. In some cases, different drugs may be used.\n \n  Some of the other chemo drugs that are helpful in treating ovarian cancer include:\n \n   \n   Albumin bound paclitaxel (nab-paclitaxel, Abraxane)\n \n   Altretamine (Hexalen)\n \n   Capecitabine (Xeloda)\n \n   Cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan)\n \n   Etoposide (VP-16)\n \n   Gemcitabine (Gemzar)\n \n   Ifosfamide (Ifex)\n \n   Irinotecan (CPT-11, Camptosar)\n \n   Liposomal doxorubicin (Doxil)\n \n   Melphalan\n \n   Pemetrexed (Alimta)\n \n   Topotecan\n \n   Vinorelbine (Navelbine)\n",

        "text": "Intraperitoneal (IP) chemotherapy\n \n  For women who have stage III ovarian cancer (cancer that has not spread outside the abdomen) and whose cancers were optimally debulked (no tumors larger than 1 cm after surgery), intraperitoneal (IP) chemotherapy might be given in addition to systemic chemo (paclitaxel given in a vein). \n \n  In IP chemotherapy, the drugs cisplatin and paclitaxel are injected into the abdominal cavity through a catheter (thin tube). The tube can be placed during the staging/debulking surgery, but sometimes it is placed later. If it is done later, it can be placed by a surgeon using laparoscopy, or by an interventional radiologist under x-ray guidance. The catheter is usually connected to a port, a half dollar-sized disk topped with a pliable diaphragm. The port is placed under the skin against a bony structure of the abdominal wall, such as a rib or pelvic bone. A needle can be placed through the skin and into the port to give chemo and other drugs. Over time, problems may occur with the catheter (for example, it might become plugged or infected), but this is rare. .\n \n  Giving chemo this way gives the most concentrated dose of the drugs directly to the cancer cells in the abdominal cavity. This chemo also gets absorbed into the bloodstream and so can reach cancer cells outside the abdominal cavity. IP chemotherapy seems to help some women live longer than IV chemo alone, but the side effects are often more severe. Women getting  IP chemotherapy might have more abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and other side effects, which might make some women stop their treatment early. \n    The risk of side effects also means a woman must have normal kidney function and be in good overall heath before starting IP chemo. Women also cannot have a lot of adhesions or scar tissue inside their abdomen (belly) because this can keep the chemo from reaching all the exposed cancer cells.\n",

Some of the most common possible side effects include:\n \n   \n   Nausea and vomiting\n \n   Loss of appetite\n \n   Loss of hair\n \n   Hand and foot rashes\n \n   Mouth sores\n \n  \n \n  Chemo can also affect the blood-forming cells of the bone marrow, which can lead to:\n \n   \n   Increased chance of infections (from low white blood cell counts, also called leukopenia\n)\n \n   Easy bruising or bleeding (from low blood platelet counts. also called thrombocytopenia\n)\n \n   Fatigue (from low red blood cell counts and other reasons, also called anemia\n)\n \n  \n \n  These side effects usually go away after treatment is finished. While you are in treatment, tell your cancer care team about any side effects you are having. There are often ways to lessen these side effects. For example, drugs can be given to help prevent or reduce nausea and vomiting.\n \n  Some chemo drugs may have long-term or even permanent side effects:\n \n   \n   Cisplatin can cause kidney damage. To help prevent this, doctors give lots of IV fluid before and after this drug is given.\n \n   Both cisplatin and the taxanes can cause nerve damage (called neuropathy\n). This can lead to problems with numbness, tingling, or even pain in the hands and feet.\n \n   Cisplatin can also damage the nerves to the ear, which can lead to hearing loss (called ototoxicity\n).\n \n   Chemo can also cause early menopause and infertility (being unable to become pregnant), which may be permanent. This is rarely an issue in the treatment of epithelial ovarian cancer, since most women have both ovaries removed as a part of treatment.\n \n   Rarely, some chemo drugs can permanently damage bone marrow. This can later cause abone marrow cancer such asmyelodysplastic syndromeor evenacute myeloid leukemia.This is called asecond cancer.Your health care team knows which drugs can cause this problem and will discuss this possibility with you. Their positive effects against ovarian cancer offset the small chance that any of these drugs will cause another cancer.\n \n   Ifosfamide can cause irritation and bleeding of the bladder lining (hemorrhagic cystitis). This can usually be prevented by giving the drug mesna with the ifosfamide.\n \n  \n \n  Other drugs can have other side effects, so ask your doctor what side effects to expect from the drugs that you will receive. Most side effects improve once treatment is stopped, but some can last a long time and may never go away completely.\n",

        "text": "Targeted Therapy for Ovarian Cancer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n \n \n  \nTargeted therapy is a  type of cancer treatment that uses drugs  to identify and attack cancer cells while doing little damage to normal cells. These therapies attack the cancer cells' inner workings − the programming that makes them different from normal, healthy cells. Each type of targeted therapy works differently, but they all change the way a cancer cell grows, divides, repairs itself, or interacts with other cells.\n \n  Bevacizumab\n \n  Bevacizumab (Avastin) belongs to a class of drugs called angiogenesis inhibitors\n. For cancers to grow and spread, they need to make new blood vessels to nourish themselves (called angiogenesis). This drug attaches to a protein called VEGF (that signals new blood vessels to form) and slows or stops cancer growth.\n   \n \n  Bevacizumab has been shown to shrink or slow the growth of advanced epithelial ovarian cancers. Bevacizumab appears to work even better when given along with chemotherapy having shown good results in terms of shrinking (or stopping the growth of) tumors. But it doesn’t seem to help women live longer.\n \n  Bevacizumab can also be given with olaparib (see below) as maintenance treatment in women whose cancers have the BRCA mutation or genomic instability (see below) and have shrunk quite a bit with chemotherapy containing carboplatin or cisplatin. \n \n  This drug is given as an infusion into the vein (IV) every 2 to 3 weeks.\n \n  Side effects of bevacizumab\n \n  Common side effects include high blood pressure, tiredness, bleeding, low white blood cell counts, headaches, mouth sores, loss of appetite, and diarrhea. Rare but possibly serious side effects include blood clots, severe bleeding, slow wound healing, holes forming in the colon (called perforations), and the formation of abnormal connections between the bowel and the skin or bladder (fistulas). If a perforation or fistula occurs it can lead to severe infection and may require surgery to correct.\n \n  PARP inhibitors\n \n  Olaparib (Lynparza), rucaparib (Rubraca), and niraparib (Zejula) are drugs known as a PARP (poly(ADP)-ribose polymerase) inhibitors\n. PARP enzymes are normally involved in one pathway to help repair damaged DNA inside cells. TheBRCA genes (BRCA1 and BRCA2)are also normally involved in a different pathway of DNA repair, and mutations in those genes can block that pathway. By blocking the PARP pathway, these drugs make it very hard for tumor cells with an abnormal BRCA\n gene to repair damaged DNA, which often leads to the death of these cells.If you are not known to have a BRCA\n mutation, your doctor might test your blood or saliva and your tumor to be sure you have one before starting treatment with one of these drugs.\n \n  All of these drugs are taken daily by mouth, as pills or capsules.\n \n  and are used to treat advanced ovarian cancer, typically after chemotherapy has been tried. These drugs can be used  in patients with or without mutations in one of the BRCA\n genes.\n \n  In women with a BRCA mutation:\n \n   \n   Olaparib can be used to treat advanced ovarian cancer that has gotten smaller in response to first treatment with chemotherapy containing cisplatin or carboplatin. \n \n   Olaparib and rucaparib can be used to treat advanced ovarian cancer that has previously been treated with 2 or 3 chemotherapy drugs.  \n \n   Olaparib can be used with bevacizumab (see above) as maintenance treatment in women whose cancers have shrunk quite a bit with chemotherapy containing carboplatin or cisplatin.\n \n  \n \n  In women without a BRCA mutation:\n \n   \n   If the tumor has a high genomic instability score (a test measuring the amount of abnormal genes in cancer cells), olaparib can be used with bevacizumab as maintenance treatment in women whose cancers have shrunk quite a bit with chemotherapy containing carboplatin or cisplatin.\n \n  \n \n  In women with or without a BRCA mutation:\n \n   \n   Olaparib and rucaparib can be used to treat advanced ovarian cancer that has come back after treatment, and then shrank in response to chemotherapy containing cisplatin or carboplatin.\n \n  \n \n  Olaparib and rucaparib can help extend the time before the cancer comes back or starts growing again.\n \n  These drugs have been shown to help shrink or slow the growth of some advanced ovarian cancers for a time. So far, though, it's not clear if they can help women live longer.\n \n   may be used in different situations to treat  ovarian cancer.\n \n  In women with or without a BRCA\n gene mutation:\n  \n   \n   Niraparib might be used as maintenance treatment for ovarian cancer, where the cancer has shrunk with chemotherapy containing cisplatin or carboplatin\n \n  \n \n  In women with a BRCA mutation:\n \n   \n   Niraparib might be used to treat advanced ovarian cancer after several chemotherapy drugs have been tried\n \n  \n \n  In women without a BRCA mutation but whose tumor has a high genomic instability score (a test measuring the amount of abnormal genes in cancer cells): \n \n   \n   Niraparib might be used to treat advanced ovarian cancer after several chemotherapy drugs have been tried and if the cancer started growing 6 months or more after the last chemo was given\n \n  \n \n  These drugs have been shown to help shrink or slow the growth of some advanced ovarian cancers for a time. So far, though, it's not clear if they can help women live longer.\n \n  Side effects of PARP inhibitors\n  \n  Side effects of these drugs can include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fatigue, loss of appetite, taste changes, low red blood cell counts (anemia), belly pain, and muscle and joint pain. Rarely, some patients treated with these drugs have developed a blood cancer, such as myelodysplastic syndrome or acute myeloid leukemia. \n \n  Drugs that target cells with NTRK gene changes\n \n  A very small number of ovarian cancers have changes in one of the NTRK\n genes. Cells with these gene changes can lead to abnormal cell growth and cancer.  and  are targeted drugs that stop the proteins made by the abnormal NTRK\n genes. These drugs can be used in people with advanced ovarian cancer whose tumor has an NTRK\n gene change and is still growing despite other treatments.\n \n  These drugs are taken as pills, once or twice a day.\n \n  Side effects of drugs that target NTRK gene changes\n \n  Common side effects include dizziness, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, constipation, weight gain, and diarrhea.\n \n  Less common but serious side effects can include abnormal liver tests, heart problems, and confusion.\n   \n \n\n\n\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n\n    \n    \n    \n\n    \n        More information about targeted therapy\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n    \n    \n    \n\n    \n        To learn more about how targeted drugs are used to treat cancer, see Targeted Cancer Therapy.\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n    \n    \n    \n\n    \n        To learn about some of the side effects listed here and how to manage them, see Managing Cancer-related Side Effects.\n"

        "text": "Hormone therapy is the use of hormones or hormone-blocking drugs to fight cancer. This type of systemic therapy is rarely used to treat epithelial ovarian cancer, but is more often used to treat ovarian stromal tumors.\n \n  Luteinizing-hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists\n \n  LHRH agonists (sometimes called GnRH agonists\n) switch off estrogen production by the ovaries. These drugs are used to lower estrogen levels in women who are premenopausal. Examples of LHRH agonists include goserelin (Zoladex) and leuprolide (Lupron). These drugs are injected every 1 to 3 months. Side effects can include any of the symptoms of menopause, such as hot flashes and vaginal dryness. If they are taken for a long time (years), these drugs can weaken bones (sometimes leading to osteoporosis).\n \n  Tamoxifen\n \n  Tamoxifen is a drug that is often used to treat breast cancer. It can also be used to treat ovarian stromal tumors and is rarely used to treat advanced epithelial ovarian cancer. Tamoxifen acts as an anti-estrogen in many tissues in the body, but as a weak estrogen in others. The goal of tamoxifen therapy is to keep any estrogens circulating in the woman’s body from stimulating cancer cell growth. The anti-estrogen activity of this drug can lead to side effects like hot flashes and vaginal dryness. Because tamoxifen acts like a weak estrogen in some areas of the body, it does not cause bone loss but can increase the risk of serious blood clots in the legs.\n \n  Aromatase inhibitors\n \n  Aromatase inhibitors are drugs that block an enzyme (called aromatase\n) that turns other hormones into estrogen in post-menopausal women. They don’t stop the ovaries from making estrogen, so they are only helpful in lowering estrogen levels in women after menopause. These drugs are mainly used to treat breast cancer, but can also be used to treat some ovarian stromal tumors that have come back after treatment as well as low grade serous carcinomas. They include letrozole (Femara), anastrozole (Arimidex), and exemestane (Aromasin). These drugs are taken as pills once a day.\n \n  Common side effects of aromatase inhibitors include hot flashes, joint and muscle pain, and bone thinning. The bone thinning can lead to osteoporosis and bones that break easily.\n",

        "text": "Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays or particles to kill cancer cells. These x-rays may be given in a procedure that is much like having a regular  x-ray.  Aggressive chemotherapy is usually more effective, so radiation therapy is rarely used in this country as the main treatment for ovarian cancer. However, it can be useful in treating areas where the cancer has spread, either near the main tumor or in a distant organ, like the brain or spinal cord.\n \n  External beam radiation therapy\n \n  This is the most common type of radiation therapy for women with ovarian cancer. External radiation therapy is much like getting an x-ray, but the radiation is stronger. A machine focuses the radiation on the area affected by the cancer. The procedure itself is painless. Each treatment lasts only a few minutes, but the setup time—getting you into place for treatment—usually takes longer. Treatments are given 5 days a week for several weeks.\n  \n  Some common side effects include:\n \n   \n   Skin changes– the skin in the treated area may look and feel sunburned or even blister and peel\n \n   Fatigue (tiredness)\n \n   Nausea and vomiting\n \n   Diarrhea\n \n   Vaginal irritation, sometimes with a discharge (if the pelvis is being treated)\n \n  \n \n  These side effects improve after treatment is stopped. Skin changes gradually fade, and the skin returns to normal in 6 to 12 months.\n \n  If you are having side effects from radiation, tell your cancer care team. There may be ways to manage them.\n \n  Brachytherapy\n \n  Brachytherapy, also known asinternal radiation,is another way to deliver radiation therapy. Instead of aiming radiation beams from outside the body, a device containing radioactive seeds or pellets is placed inside the body, near the cancer.  This is rarely done for ovarian cancer.\n    \n \n",

The uterus, both fallopian tubes, both ovaries, and omentum (fatty tissue from the upper abdomen near the stomach and intestines) are removed. The surgeon will also try to remove as much tumor as possible. The goal is to leave behind no visible tumor or no tumor larger than 1 cm. When this goal is reached, the cancer is said to have been optimally debulked\n. Sometimes tumor is growing on the intestines, and in order to remove the cancer, part of the intestine will have to be removed. Sometimes pieces of other organs (like the bladder or liver) may also have to be removed to take out  the cancer. The smaller the remaining tumor, the better the outlook will be.\n \n  After recovery from surgery, combination chemois given. The combination used most often is carboplatin (or cisplatin) and a taxane, such as paclitaxel (Taxol), given IV (into a vein) for 6 cycles. Thetargeted drugbevacizumab (Avastin) might be given along with chemo as well. (If it is, it’s typically continued alone after chemo for up to about a year.) \n \n  Another option is to give intra-abdominal(intraperitoneal or IP) chemoalong withintravenous (IV) chemo, after surgery.  IP chemo is usually only considered if the cancer was optimally debulked − it may not work as well if a lot of tumor is left in the abdomen. \n \n  After surgery, and during and after chemo, blood tests checking for the CA-125 tumor marker will be done to see how well the treatment is working. A CT scan, PET-CT scan, or MRI might also be done.\n \n  For women who are not healthy enough to have full staging and debulking surgery, chemo might be given as the first treatment. If the chemo works and the woman becomes stronger, surgery to debulk the cancer may be done, often followed by more chemo. Most often, 3 cycles of chemo are given before surgery, with at least 3 more after surgery (for a total of at least 6 cycles). Giving chemo before surgery is also sometimes an option for some women with advanced cancers that aren’t likely to be optimally debulked if surgery is done first.\n    \n   If the cancer shrinks a lot or appears to be gone after chemotherapy with a platinum drug (cisplatin or carboplatin), doctors might recommend additional treatment for some women. This is called maintenance\n therapy.\n It is aimed at killing any cancer cells that were left behind after treatment but are too small to be seen on tests. The goal of maintenance therapy is to keep the cancer from coming back after platinum chemotherapy. Drugs that might be used include bevacizumab, niraparib, rucaparib, and olaparib. But since the studies so far show that maintenance therapy does not necessarily help a woman live longer and may cause more side effects, this is still being studied in clinical trials.\n   \n",

Recurrence can be local (in or near the same place it started) or distant (spread to organs like the lungs or bone). \nPersistent tumors are those that never went away completely after treatment. Advanced epithelial ovarian cancer often comes back months or years after the initial treatment.\n \n  Sometimes, moresurgeryis recommended. Most women with recurrent or persistent ovarian cancer are treated with some form ofchemo. Which chemo drugs are used depends on what was used the first time and how well it worked (how long the cancer stayed away). The longer it takes for the cancer to come back after treatment, the better the chance that additional chemo will work. If it has been at least 6 months since any chemo,  carboplatin and paclitaxel are often used (even if these drugs were given before). Giving carboplatin with another drug is also an option.\n \n  If the cancer comes back in less than 6 months (or if it never went away at all), different chemo drugs usually will be tried. There are many different chemo drugs that can be used to treat ovarian cancer, so some women may receive several different chemo regimens over several years.\n \n  Treatment withtargeted drugsmight also be helpful. For example, bevacizumab (Avastin) may be given with chemo. A PARP inhibitor drug such as olaparib (Lynparza), rucaparib (Rubraca), or niraparib (Zejula) may also be an option at some point. In addition, some women benefit fromhormonal treatmentwith drugs like anastrozole, letrozole, or tamoxifen. Someone who didn't initially receive chemo can be treated with the same drugs that are used for newly diagnosed cancer − usually carboplatin and paclitaxel.\n \n  Aclinical trialfor new treatments might provide important advantages for women with recurrent or persistent ovarian cancer.

This is called ascites\n. It can be very uncomfortable but can be treated with a procedure called paracentesis\n. After the skin is numbed, a needle is used to withdraw the fluid, often several quarts, into a bottle. Often, ultrasound is used to guide the needle. Often the fluid builds up again, and this procedure needs to be repeated. Sometimes a catheter (a thin flexible tube) is placed into the abdomen and left there so that fluid can be removed as often as is needed without using a needle. Another option is to inject chemo directly into the abdomen to slow the buildup of fluid. Treatment with bevacizumab(Avastin) may also help slow fluid buildup. These treatments can relieve symptoms for some women and, rarely, might help some women live longer. Often, however, their effects are temporary, and the cancer returns or persists.\n \n  Ovarian cancer can also block the intestinal tract. This is called obstruction\n, and can cause abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. Dealing with an intestinal blockage can be difficult. There are several procedures that might be done, depending on the type of obstruction and your overall health:\n \n   \n   Doctors may place a tube through the skin and into the stomach to allow the stomach juices to drain, so that the digestive tract isn’t completely blocked.\n \n   Sometimes a stent (a stiff tube) can be put into the large intestine to relieve a blockage. Since this option has a high risk of complications, you should discuss the risks and benefits with your doctor first.\n    \n \n   For some women, surgerycan be done to relieve intestinal obstruction. This is usually only done if you are well enough to get additional treatments (like chemo) after surgery. Often, however, the cancer has grown so much in the abdomen that surgery to unblock the intestine doesn't work.\n",

These tumors look the same as invasive epithelial ovarian cancers when seen on an ultrasound or CT scan. Doctors can't be sure whether a tumor is invasive or borderline until a biopsy sample has been taken (usually during surgery) and checked in a lab. \n \n  Surgery for borderline tumors is similar to the surgery for invasive ovarian cancer, with the goals of removing the tumor along with full \n \n   \n   For women who have finished having children, the uterus, both fallopian tubes, and both ovaries are removed. Surgical staging is done to see if the tumor has spread outside the ovary or pelvis. Sometimes, this means removing the omentum and some lymph nodes, and doing washings of the abdomen and pelvis.\n \n   For women who want to be able to become pregnant in the future, only the ovary with the tumor and the fallopian tube on that side is removed. Rarely, just the part of the ovary containing  the tumor is removed. These women still should have surgical staging to see if the tumor has spread. If the tumor is only in one ovary, the woman is usually observed without further treatment and monitored with ultrasound exams. \n \n  \n \n  For tumors that haven't spread outside the ovary,Chemotherapy(chemo) andradiation therapyare not generally the first treatments used. Observation is often recommended for borderline tumors because they grow very slowly and even when they spread they are rarely fatal.\n \n  If the tumor has spread outside the ovary when it is first diagnosed, the surgeon will remove as much of it as possible (debulking). Treatment after surgery depends on whether the spread is invasive\n or not. When borderline tumors spread, the can form tumor implants (deposits) on the peritoneum (lining of the abdomen) and on the surface of organs in the abdomen and pelvis. Most often, these implants are non-invasive, meaning they haven't grown into the abdominal lining or organs. \n \n   \n   For women with non-invasive spread from a borderline tumor, chemo has not been shown to be helpful after debulking surgery. These women are usually watched closely without further treatment.\n \n   For women whose tumor implants are invasive, chemo may be an option, but the benefit from chemo for these cancers is unclear. When chemo is used, it is usually the same as chemo given for invasive ovarian cancer.\n \n  \n   \n  If the tumor comes back after initial surgery, further debulking surgery might be considered. Chemo and, rarely, radiation therapy are also options for recurrent borderline tumors. \n"

        "text": "Treatment for Germ Cell Tumors of the Ovary\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n \n \n  \nTreating benign germ cell tumors\n \n  Women with benign (non-cancerous) germ cell tumors such as mature teratomas (dermoid cysts) are cured by removing the part of the ovary that has the tumor (ovarian cystectomy) or by removing the entire ovary.\n \n  Treating malignant germ cell tumors\n \n  As with epithelial ovarian cancers, it is a good idea to consult with a gynecologic oncologist for treating malignant germ cell tumors, especially because these are so uncommon. About 2-3% of all ovarian cancers are germ cell tumors.\n \n  For most types and stages of germ cell cancers\n \n  Most types and stages of germ cell cancers of the ovary are treated the same way, withsurgeryandchemotherapy(chemo). \n \n   In general, all women with malignant germ cell tumors will have the same staging surgery that is done for epithelial ovarian cancer. For women who still want to be able to have  children, the cancerous ovary and the fallopian tube on the same side are removed, but the uterus, the ovary, and the fallopian tube on the opposite side are left behind. This isn’t an option when the cancer is in both ovaries. If preserving fertility is not a concern, complete staging including removing both ovaries, both fallopian tubes, and the uterus is generally recommended.\n \n  Sometimes, the doctor might consider removing only a part of one ovary to allow a woman to keep her ovarian function. Even when both ovaries need to be removed, a woman may wish to keep her uterus to allow future pregnancy through the use of in-vitro fertilization. \n \n  If cancer has spread beyond the ovaries , debulking surgery may be done as a part of the initial surgery. This removes as much cancer as possible without damaging or removing essential organs.\n  \n   \nMost women with germ cell cancer will need to be treated with combination chemo for at least 3 cycles. The combination used most often is PEB (or BEP), and includes the chemo drugs cisplatin, etoposide, and bleomycin. Dysgerminomas are usually very sensitive to chemo, and can sometimes be treated with the less toxic combination of carboplatin and etoposide. Other drug combinations may be used to treat cancer that has recurred (come back) or hasn't responded to treatment.\n \n  Germ cell cancers can raise blood levels of the tumor markers human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG), alpha-fetoprotein(AFP), and/or lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). If the blood levels of these are high before treatment starts, they are rechecked during chemo (usually before each cycle). If the chemo is working, the levels will go downl. If the levels stay up, it might be a sign that a different treatment is needed.\n \n  Stage IA dysgerminoma\n \n  If dysgerminoma is limited to one ovary, surgery to remove that ovary and the fallopian tube on the same side might be the only treatment needed, without chemo after surgery. This approach requires close follow-up so that if the cancer comes back it can be found early and treated. Most women in this stage are cured with surgery and never need chemo.\n \n  Grade 1 immature teratoma\n \n  A grade 1 immature teratoma is made up mostly of non-cancerous tissue, and only a few cancerous areas are seen. These tumors rarely come back after being removed. If careful staging has determined that a grade 1 immature teratoma is limited to one or both ovaries, surgery to remove the ovary or ovaries containing the cancer and the fallopian tube or tubes might be the only treatment needed. \n \n  Treating recurrent or persistent germ cell tumors\n \n  Recurrent tumors are those that come back after initial treatment. Persistent tumors are those that never disappeared even after treatment. Sometimes increased blood levels of the tumor markers HCG and AFP will be the only sign that a germ cell cancer is still there (or has come back). Other times a definite tumor might be seen and removed by surgery. \n \n  Treatment for recurrent or persistent germ cell tumors might include surgery, chemo or, rarely, radiation therapy. For chemo, a combination of drugs is used most often. PEB (cisplatin, etoposide, and bleomycin) may be used if  this combination of drugs was not used before. For women who have already been treated with PEB, other drug combinations are used.\n \n  For recurrent or persistent germ cell cancer, a clinical trialfor new treatments may provide important advantages. Ask your cancer care team for information about clinical trials for your type of cancer.\n"

However, some stage I tumors are more likely to come back after surgery, for example: \n \n   \n   Very large tumors\n \n   Tumors where the cyst broke open (ruptured)\n \n   Poorly-differentiated tumors (also called high grade − the cancer cells don’t look  like normal tissue when examined in the lab).\n \n  \n \n  These cancers are said to be at high risk\n for recurrence. Women with high-risk stage I stromal cancers have 2 options after surgery: observation (being watched closely) orchemotherapy(chemo).\n \n  Stages II, III, and IV\n \n  These cancers are treated with surgery to remove the ovary with the tumor. Surgery is also used to stage and debulk the cancer, as needed. This may be followed by chemo or  Often, the chemo used is the same type used to treat germ cell tumors (PEB: cisplatin, etoposide, and bleomycin). The combination of carboplatin and paclitaxel (Taxol) may also be used.Hormone treatmentis most often used to treat advanced stromal tumors in women who cannot tolerate chemo, but who want to try treatment. This may mean treatment with a drug such as leuprolide (Lupron) and goserelin (Zoladex), the drug tamoxifen, or an aromatase inhibitor. Rarely,radiation therapymay be an option.\n \n  Recurrent stromal tumors\n \n  Cancer that comes back after treatment is said to be recurrent\n. This can happen many years later for stromal tumors. Even so, the prognosis (outlook) might still be good because they grow so slowly. Surgery may be repeated. Any of the chemo regimens used initially can also be used to treat a relapse. Hormone therapy is also an option to treat recurrence. There really isn't a standard treatment for recurrent stromal cancer, so treatment as part of a clinical trial is also a good option. Radiation therapy might also sometimes be helpful.\n \n  For tumors that produce hormones, the hormone blood levels may be checked regularly after surgery to check for increased levels that could suggest the tumor has returned. The level of a hormone called inhibin can also go up with some stromal tumors and might be useful to check for  recurrence. \n"

        "text": "Living as an Ovarian Cancer Survivor\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n \n \n  \nFor some people with ovarian cancer, treatment may remove or destroy the cancer. Completing treatment can be both stressful and exciting. You will be relieved to finish treatment, yet it is hard not to worry about cancer coming back. (When cancer returns, it is called recurrence\n.) This is  very common if you've  had cancer.\n  \n  For other people, ovarian cancer never goes away completely. Some women may be treated with chemotherapy on and off for years. Learning to live with cancer that does not go away can be difficult and very stressful. \n \n  Life after ovarian cancer means returning to some familiar things and also making some new choices.\n \n  Follow up care\n \n  Ask your doctor for a survivorship care plan\n \n  Talk with your doctor about developing a survivorship care plan for you. This plan might include:\n \n   \n   A suggested schedule for follow-up exams and tests\n \n   A schedule for other tests you might need in the future, such as early detection (screening) tests for other types of cancer, or tests to look for long-term health effects from your cancer or its treatment\n \n   A list of possible late- or long-term side effectsfrom your treatment, including what to watch for and when you should contact your doctor\n \n   Diet and physical activity suggestions\n \n   Reminders to keep your appointments with your primary care provider (PCP) who will monitor your general health care, including your cancer screening tests. \n \n  \n \n  Typical follow-up schedules after ovarian cancer\n \n  Even if you have completed treatment, you will likely have follow-up visits with your doctor for many years. It is very important to go to all of your follow-up appointments. During these visits, your doctors will ask questions about any problems you may have and may do exams and lab tests or x-rays and scans to look for signs of cancer or treatment side effects.\n \n  Some cancer treatment side effects may last a long time or might not even show up until years after you have finished treatment. Your doctor visits are a good time to ask questions and talk about any changes or problems you notice or concerns you have.\n \n  To some extent, the frequency of follow up visits and tests will depend on the stage of your cancer and the chance of it coming back.\n \n  Doctor visits\n \n  Your doctor will probably recommend you have a physical exam and pelvic exam every 2 to 4 months for the first couple of years after treatment, then every 3-6 months or so for the next few years. \n \n  Imaging tests\n \n  Whether or not your doctor recommends imaging tests will depend on the stage of your cancer and other factors. CT scans, MRIs or PET scans may be done depending on any symptoms or other concerning signs. \n \n  Blood tests for tumor markers\n  \n  Follow-up for ovarian cancer usually includes  blood tests for tumor markers or hormones that help recognize recurrence. The choice of which blood tests to do depends on the type of cancer a woman has. \n \n   \n   For epithelial ovarian cancer, CA-125 is the tumor marker used most often to check for recurrence. But it is not clear if checking for CA-125 levels and treating you before you have symptoms will help you live longer. Treatment based only on CA-125 levels and not symptoms can increase side effects, so it is important to discuss the pros and cons of CA-125 monitoring and quality of life with your doctor. Tests for other tumor markers, such as CA 19-9, CEA, and HE-4, are used most often for women whose CA-125 levels never went up.\n \n   For germ cell tumors, blood is tested for alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and/or human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG).\n \n   For stromal cancers, checking levels of hormones like estrogen, testosterone, and inhibin is sometimes helpful.\n \n  \n     \n  Keeping health insurance and copies of your medical records\n \n  Even after treatment, it’s very important to keep health insurance. Tests and doctor visits cost a lot, and even though no one wants to think of their cancer coming back, this could happen.\n \n  At some point after your cancer treatment, you might find yourself seeing a new doctor who doesn’t know about your medical history. It’s important to keep copies of your medical records to give your new doctor the details of your diagnosis and treatment. Learn more in Keeping Copies of Important Medical Records.\n            \n  Can I lower my risk of the ovariancancer progressing or coming back?\n \n  If you have (or have had) ovarian cancer, you probably want to know if there are things you can do that might lower your risk of the cancer growing or coming back, such as exercising, eating a certain type of diet, or taking nutritional supplements. Unfortunately, it’s not yet clear if there are things you can do that will help.\n \n  Adopting healthy behaviors such as not smoking, eating well, getting regular physical activity, and staying at a healthy weight might help, but no one knows for sure. However, we do know that these types of changes can have positive effects on your health that can extend beyond your risk of ovariancancer or other cancers.\n \n  About dietary supplements\n \n  So far, no dietary supplements (including vitamins, minerals, and herbal products) have been shown to clearly help lower the risk of ovariancancer progressing or coming back. This doesn’t mean that no supplements will help, but it’s important to know that none have been proven to do so.\n \n  Dietary supplements are not regulated like medicines in the United States – they do not have to be proven effective (or even safe) before being sold, although there are limits on what they’re allowed to claim they can do. If you’re thinking about taking any type of nutritional supplement, talk to your health care team. They can help you decide which ones you can use safely while avoiding those that might be harmful.\n                                     \n  If the cancer comes back\n \n  If the cancer does recur at some point, your treatment options will depend on where the cancer is located, what treatments you’ve had before, and your health.\n \n  For more general information on recurrence, you may also want to see Understanding Recurrence.\n \n  Could I get a second cancer after ovarian cancer treatment?\n \n  People who’ve had ovarian cancer can still get other cancers, Ovarian cancer survivors are at higher risk for getting some other types of cancer. Learn more in Second Cancers After Ovarian Cancer.\n   \n  Getting emotional support\n \n  Some amount of feeling depressed, anxious, or worried is normal when cancer is a part of your life. Some people are affected more than others. But everyone can benefit from help and support from other people, whether friends and family, religious groups, support groups, professional counselors, or others. Learn more in Life After Cancer.\n"

        "text": "Second Cancers After Ovarian Cancer\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n \n \n  \n \n   Cancer survivors can be affected by a number of health problems, but often their greatest concern is facing cancer again. If a cancer comes back after treatment it is called a “recurrence.” But some cancer survivors may develop a new, unrelated cancer later. This is called a “second cancer.” No matter what type of cancer you have had, it is still possible to get another (new) cancer, even after surviving the first.\n \n   Unfortunately, being treated for cancer doesn’t mean you can’t get another cancer. People who have had cancer can still get the same types of cancers that other people get. In fact, certain types of cancer and cancer treatments can be linked to a higher risk of certain second cancers.\n \n   Survivorsof ovarian cancer can get any type of second cancer, but they have an increased risk of:\n \n    \n    \n \n    \n \n    \n \n    Cancer of the renal pelvis (part of the kidney)\n \n    \n \n    \n \n    \n \n    \n \n    \n \n   \n \n   Women treated with radiation therapy also have an increased risk of soft tissue cancer and possibly pancreas cancer.\n \n   The increased risk of leukemia is linked to treatment with chemotherapy. The main drugs linked with leukemia risk are platinum agents (like cisplatin and carboplatin) and alkylating agents (like cyclophosphamide and ifosfamide). The risk increases as the total dose of these drugs increases, but the overall risk is still low.\n \n   Genetic factors that may have caused ovarian cancer in the first place may also add to the risk of breast and colorectal cancers. For example, women with mutations in theBRCA geneshave a high risk of both ovarian and breast cancer, as well as some other cancers. Women with the inherited disorder called hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC, also called Lynch syndrome), have a high risk of colon, rectum, small intestine, and renal pelvis cancers, as well as ovarian and other cancers.\n \n   Other risk factors for ovarian and breast cancer that overlap may also help explain some of the increased risk of breast cancer in ovarian cancer survivors.\n \n   Studies have shown that the risk of developing solid tumors is higher during all follow-up periods after ovarian cancer.\n \n   Can I lower my risk of getting a second cancer?\n \n   There are steps you can take to lower your risk of getting another cancer and stay as healthy as possible. For example, it’s important to stay away from tobacco products. Smoking increases the risk of many cancers.\n \n   To help maintain good health, ovarian cancer survivors should also:\n \n    \n    Get to and stay at a healthy weight\n \n    Keep physically active and limit sitting or lying down time \n \n    Follow a healthy eating pattern that includes plenty of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, and that limits or avoids red and processed meats, sugary drinks, and highly processed foods.\n \n    It’s best not to drink alcohol. If you do drink, have no more than 1 drink per day for women or 2 drinks per day for men.\n \n   \n \n   These steps may also lower the risk of some other health problems.\n \n   See Second Cancers in Adults for more information about causes of second cancers.\n"

Some ovarian cancers can also start in the fallopian tubes - tubes that connect the ovary to the uterus. \n \n  Women have 2 ovaries. They are where eggs are made, and also where most of women’s hormones are made.\n \n  Cancer cells can spread to other parts of the body. Cancer cells in the ovary can sometimes travel to the liver and grow there. When cancer cells do this, it’s called metastasis. To doctors, the cancer cells in the new place look just like the ones from the ovary.\n \n  Cancer is always named for the place where it starts. So when ovarian cancer spreads to the liver (or any other place), it’s still called ovarian cancer. It’s not called liver cancer.\n \n \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n \n \n  \n.\n \n  Are there different kinds of ovarian cancer?\n \n  There are many types of ovarian cancer. Your doctor can tell you more about the type you have. Below are the medical names for the most common types of ovarian cancer.\n \n  Epithelial cancers\n \n  These cancers start from the cells that cover the outside of the ovary.\n \n  Germ cell cancers\n \n  These start from the ovarian cells that make the eggs.\n \n  Stromal cancers\n \n  These start from cells that hold the ovary together and make female hormones.\n \n  Questions to ask the doctor\n \n   \n   Why do you think I have cancer?\n \n   Is there a chance I don’t have cancer?\n \n   Would you please write down the kind of ovarian cancer you think I might have?\n \n   What will happen next?\n",

Here are some of the tests you may need:\n \n   \n    For this test a small probe is put into the vagina or on the skin over the belly (abdomen). It gives off sound waves and picks up the echoes as they bounce off tissues. The sound waves make a picture of the ovaries on a video screen.\n \n    This is also called a “CAT scan.” It’s a kind of x-ray that takes clear pictures of the ovaries and other body parts to see if the cancer has spread.\n \n    \nX-rays of your chest may be done to see if your cancer has spread to your lungs.\n \n   This is a type of surgery that uses a thin, lighted tube so that a doctor can look at the ovaries and other body parts in the area. This helps the doctor tell if the tumor has spread and plan surgery or other treatments\n \n    The doctor may check your blood to see if it has high levels of some proteins. Levels of these proteins can go up if certain cancers are there.\n \n  \n \n  Ovarian biopsy\n \n  In a biopsy, the doctor takes out a little bit of tissue to check it for cancer cells. A biopsy is the only way to tell for sure if you have cancer. For ovarian cancer, the biopsy is most often done when you have surgery to take out the cancer.\n \n  Questions to ask the doctor\n \n   \n   What tests will I need to have?\n \n   Who will do these tests?\n \n   Where will they be done?\n \n   Who can explain them to me?\n \n   How and when will I get the results?\n \n   Who will explain the results to me?\n \n   What do I need to do next?\n",

The treatment plan that’s best for you will depend on:\n \n   \n   The type of ovarian cancer you have\n \n   The stage of the cancer\n \n   Your overall health\n \n   Your feelings about the treatment and the side effects that may come with it\n \n  \n \n  Surgery\n \n  Surgery is the main treatment for most ovarian cancers. The goals of surgery are to see how far the ovarian cancer has spread and to take out as much of the cancer as the doctor can. How much and what type of surgery you have depends on how far the cancer has spread, your health (other than the cancer), and if you still hope to have children. Since ovarian cancer often spreads to nearby areas, the doctor may also need to take out other parts of the body affected by the cancer. Ask your doctor what kind of surgery you will have and what to expect.\n \n  Chemotherapy\n \n  Chemo is the short word for chemotherapy – the use of drugs to fight cancer. Chemo is the use of drugs to kill cancer cells or shrink tumors. Most cancer doctors believe that using more than one drug works better in treating ovarian cancer than using one drug alone.\n \n  Targeted therapy\n \n  Targeted therapy is a newer type of cancer treatment that uses drugs to find and attack cancer cells while doing little harm to normal cells. Not all types of targeted therapy work the same, but they all change the way a cancer cell grows, divides, heals itself, or acts.\n \n  Hormone therapy\n \n  Hormone therapy is the use of hormones or hormone-blocking drugs to fight cancer. It is used more often to treat ovarian stromal cancers. There are many kinds of hormone therapy. Ask your doctor which one you will get and what to expect.\n \n  Radiation therapy\n \n  Radiation uses high-energy rays (like x-rays) to kill cancer cells or shrink tumors. Radiation is rarely, if ever, used as the main treatment for ovarian cancer. It is sometimes used to treat areas where cancer has spread.\n \n  Clinical trials\n \n  Clinical trials are research studies that test new drugs or other treatments in people. They compare standard treatments with others that may be better.\n  \n  Clinical trials are one way to get the newest cancer treatment. They are the best way for doctors to find better ways to treat cancer. If your doctor can find one that’s studying the kind of ovarian cancer you have, it’s up to you whether to take part. And, if you do sign up for a clinical trial, you can always stop at any time.\n \n  If you would like to learn more about clinical trials that might be right for you, start by asking your doctor if your clinic or hospital conducts clinical trials. See Clinical Trials to learn more.\n \n  What about other treatments that I hear about?\n \n  When you have cancer you might hear about other ways to treat the cancer or treat your symptoms. These may not always be standard medical treatments. These treatments may be vitamins, herbs, special diets, and other things. You may wonder about these treatments.\n \n  Some of these are known to help, but many have not been tested. Some have been shown not to help. A few have even been found to be harmful. Talk to your doctor about anything you’re thinking about using, whether it’s a vitamin, a diet, or anything else.\n \n  Questions to ask the doctor\n \n   \n   What treatment do you think is best for me?\n \n   What’s the goal of this treatment? Do you think it could cure the cancer?\n \n   Will treatment include surgery? If so, who will do the surgery?\n \n   What will the surgery be like?\n \n   Will I need other types of treatment too?\n \n   What side effects could I have from these treatments?\n \n   What can I do about side effects that I might have?\n \n   Is there a clinical trial that might be right for me?\n \n   What about special vitamins or diets that friends tell me about? How will I know if they are safe?\n \n   How soon do I need to start treatment?\n \n   What should I do to be ready for treatment?\n \n   Is there anything I can do to help the treatment work better?\n \n   What’s the next step?\n",

        "text": "About the ovaries\nThe ovaries are part of a woman’s reproductive system. There are 2 ovaries, with 1 located on each side of the uterus. In premenopausal women, they are almond-shaped and about 1.5 inches long. These glands contain germ cells, also called eggs. Ovaries are the primary source of estrogen and progesterone. These hormones influence breast growth, body shape, body hair, and regulate the menstrual cycle and pregnancy. During and after menopause, the ovaries stop releasing eggs and producing certain hormones.\nAbout the fallopian tubes\nThe fallopian tubes are part of a woman’s reproductive system. They are small ducts that connect the ovaries to the uterus. Typically, every woman has 2 fallopian tubes, with 1 located on each side of the uterus. During a woman’s monthly ovulation, usually an egg is released from 1 ovary and travels through a fallopian tube to the uterus.\nAbout the peritoneum\nThe peritoneum is a tissue that lines the abdomen and most of the organs in the abdomen. The tissue covers the uterus, bladder, rectum, and the ovaries and fallopian tubes. A liquid called peritoneal fluid covers the tissue’s surface. This liquid helps the organs move within the abdomen and prevents them from sticking together.\nAbout ovarian, fallopian tube, and peritoneal cancers\nIn general, the term “ovarian cancer” is often used to describe cancers that begin in the cells in the ovary, fallopian tube, or peritoneum. The cancers are closely related and are generally treated the same way. \nThese types of cancer begin when healthy cells in these areas change and grow out of control, forming a mass called a tumor. A tumor can be cancerous or benign. A cancerous tumor is malignant, meaning it can grow and spread to other parts of the body. A benign tumor means the tumor can grow but will not spread.\nAn ovarian cyst is an abnormal growth of tissue that forms on the surface of the ovary. It can occur during a woman’s normal menstrual cycle and usually goes away without treatment. Simple ovarian cysts are not cancerous.\nRecent research studies suggest that most ovarian/fallopian tube cancers are high-grade serous cancers (HGSC) (see below), and in most cases, the cancer actually starts in the distal, or outer, end of the fallopian tubes. Then, it spreads to the surface of the ovaries and beyond. Based on this new knowledge, some doctors recommend removal of the fallopian tubes rather than tying or banding the tubes for the purposes of contraception (to avoid future pregnancy). Some doctors also recommend fallopian tube removal when a woman is undergoing surgery for benign disease and does not want to get pregnant in the future. This strategy could prevent the development of these cancers in the future. Talk with your doctor about whether this may be an option for you.\nBecause the surfaces of the ovaries, the lining of the fallopian tubes, and the covering cells of the peritoneum are made up of the same types of cells, most of these diseases look alike under a microscope. Peritoneal cancer can rarely develop after ovaries and fallopian tubes have been removed. Just as with ovarian cancer, some peritoneal cancers may begin in the fallopian tubes and spread from the end of the fallopian tube into the peritoneal cavity.\nTypes of ovarian and fallopian tube cancer\nEpithelial carcinoma makes up 85% to 90% of ovarian/fallopian tube cancers. The main types of epithelial tumors include serous, endometrioid, clear cell, mucinous, mixed tumors, and several rare malignancies, including Brenner tumors. These types describe how these different ovarian/fallopian tube cancers are classified based on how they look under the microscope. There can be differences in how these cancers behave and which treatments will work best.\nThe vast majority of epithelial cancers are high-grade serous, meaning they resemble the cells lining the fallopian tube. These cancers are eitherHGSC (see above) or low-grade serous carcinoma (LGSC). HGSCs make up the vast majority of ovarian/fallopian tube cancer, most of which arise from the fallopian tube. LGSC is less common and may arise from the ovaries.\n This uncommon type of ovarian cancer develops in the egg-producing cells of the ovaries. Germ cell malignancies typically occur in females 10 to 29 years old.\nTypes of germ cell tumors include dysgerminomas, immature teratoma, endodermal sinus tumors (called EST and yolk sac tumors), and embryonal carcinomas.\nThis rare form of ovarian tumor develops in the connective tissue cells, called granulosa and theca cells, that hold the ovaries together. This tissue sometimes makes the female hormones estrogen and progesterone. Over 90% of these stromal tumors are called granulosa cell tumors, either adult or childhood types.\nGranulosa cell tumors may secrete estrogen, resulting in unusual vaginal bleeding at the time of diagnosis. Other types are Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors and steroid cell tumors.\n This cancer was once thought to be rare, but we now know that most cancers previously labeled “ovarian cancer” actually began in a fallopian tube. Most cancers arising in the fallopian tube begin in the outer end of the tube, near the fimbria, which is where the opening of the tube is located and where eggs released from the ovary must enter in order to be fertilized for pregnancy. Virtually all of these are serous cancers, and most are HGSC, although in rare cases, other types of cancer can start in the fallopian tube.\nLooking for More of an Introduction?\nIf you would like more of an introduction, explore these related items.

        "text": "This year, an estimated 21,410 people in the United States will be diagnosed with ovarian cancer. The vast majority of these cases (90%) are high-grade serous ovarian cancers (HGSC), which begin in a fallopian tube.\nFrom the mid-1980s to 2017, the number of new cases decreased by 1% to 2% each year. One reason for this decrease may be related to the decline in use of hormone replacement therapy after a 2002 publication linked hormone replacement therapy to breast cancer risk, with later data showing an association with ovarian cancer. The decrease may also be related to more women having their fallopian tubes removed. Ovarian cancer is more common in white women than in Black women.\nIt is estimated that 13,770 deaths from these diseases will occur this year. Combined, cancer of the ovaries, fallopian tubes, and peritoneum are the fifth most common cause of cancer-related death in women in the United States. The death rate declined by around 2% each year from 2009 to 2018. This decline in death rate is mostly due to advances in treatment.\nThe 5-year survival ratetells you what percent of people live at least 5 years after cancer is found. Percent means how many out of 100. The 5-year survival rate for people with all types of ovarian, fallopian tube, and peritoneal cancers is 49%.\nHowever, the rate varies widely depending on the person's age, as well as the stage, cell type, and grade of the cancer. Survival rates are also improved when debulking surgery is performed by a gynecologic oncologist instead of a gynecologist or general surgeon (see Types of Treatment). The 5-year survival rate for women younger than 65 is 61%, compared with 32% for women age 65 and older.\nIf ovarian and fallopian tube cancers are diagnosed and treated before they spread outside the ovaries and tubes, the general 5-year survival rate is 93%. Approximately 16% of women with epithelial ovarian and fallopian tube cancer are diagnosed at this stage. If the cancer has spread to surrounding tissues or organs, the 5-year survival rate is 75%. If the cancer has spread to a distant part of the body, the 5-year survival rate is 30%. Approximately 58% of women are diagnosed at this stage.\nIt is important to remember that statistics on the survival rates for people with ovarian, fallopian tube, and peritoneal cancer are an estimate. The estimate comes from annual data based on the number of people with these cancers in the United States. Also, experts measure the survival statistics every 5 years. So the estimate may not show the results of better diagnosis or treatment available for less than 5 years.

        "text": " You will find out more about the factors that increase the chance of developing ovarian, fallopian tube, and peritoneal cancer. Use the menu to see other pages.\nA risk factor is anything that increases a person's chance of developing cancer. Although risk factors often influence the development of cancer, most do not directly cause cancer. Some people with several risk factors never develop cancer, while others with no known risk factors do. Knowing your risk factors and talking about them with your doctor may help you make more informed lifestyle and health care choices.\nThe following factors may raise a woman's risk of developing ovarian/fallopian tube cancer.\nA strong family history of breast or ovarian/fallopian tube cancer puts women at higher risk for ovarian/fallopian tube cancer. Doctors believe this is because many of these families have genetic mutations, or changes in the gene, that are passed from generation to generation (see “Genetics,” below). If you are concerned that ovarian/fallopian tube cancer may run in your family, it is important to get an accurate family history, including any breast cancers in the family. A family history of certain other types of cancer, including breast cancer, is linked to an increased risk of ovarian/fallopian tube cancer. By understanding your family history, you and your doctor can talk about ways to reduce your risk and be proactive about your health.\n About 10% to 20% of ovarian/fallopian tube cancers occur because a genetic mutation, or change, has been passed down within a family. This inherited risk is called a germline mutation. ASCO recommends that all women diagnosed with the epithelial carcinoma, the most common type of ovarian/fallopian tube cancer, receive genetic testing at the time of diagnosis for several cancer risk genes, including BRCA1\n and BRCA2\n, RAD51\n, andPALB\n. This testing should be done regardless of whether there is a family history of ovarian or breast cancer. People who do not have an inherited genetic mutation should also be tested for BRCA\n mutations in the tumor cells, called somatic testing (see “Molecular testing of the tumor” in Diagnosis), as treatments for ovarian cancer with these mutations are effective regardless of whether the mutation is inherited.\nA mutation in the BRCA1\n or BRCA2\n gene is associated with an increased risk of developing these cancers. A woman with an \"average risk\" has about a 1% to 2% lifetime risk of developing ovarian/fallopian tube cancer. A woman with a BRCA1 \nmutation has around a 40% lifetime risk, and a woman with a BRCA2\n mutation has about a 10% to 20% lifetime risk. BRCA-\nrelated ovarian/fallopian tube cancers can occur in women who do not have a family history of either breast or ovarian/fallopian tube cancer. About 40% of women with ovarian/fallopian tube cancer who are found to have a BRCA\n mutation do not have a family history. First-degree and second-degree family members should also receive genetic testing if a person with ovarian/fallopian tube cancer has a BRCA\n mutation, because the risk of these cancers can be inherited. Read more about the BRCA1\n and BRCA2\n genes in this website’s section onhereditary breast and ovarian cancer.\nA genetic counselor can help you and/or your family members understand the results of genetic testing. The results of this testing can help determine your treatment options.\nThis information is based on ASCO recommendations for Germline and Somatic Tumor Testing in Epithelial Ovarian Cancer. Please note that this link takes you to a separate ASCO website.\nThere are several rare genetic conditions that cause ovarian/fallopian tube cancer. Some of the most common include:\n Lynch syndrome, also known as hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer, increases a woman's risk of ovarian/fallopian tube cancer and uterine cancer. It is caused by mutations in several different genes. Lynch syndrome also increases the risk of colorectal cancer and several other cancers.\n PJS is caused by a specific genetic mutation. The syndrome is associated with multiple polyps in the digestive tract that become noncancerous tumors and with increased pigmentation (dark spots on the skin) on the face and hands. PJS raises the risk of ovarian/fallopian tube cancer, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, cervical cancer, and several other types of cancer.\n Women with NBCCS, also called Gorlin syndrome, have an increased risk of developing fibromas. Fibromas are benign fibrous tumors of the ovaries. There is a small risk that these fibromas could develop into a type of ovarian cancer called fibrosarcoma. People with NBCCS often have multiple basal cell skin cancers and jaw cysts and may develop medulloblastoma, a type of brain tumor, in childhood.\n   . Women with Li-Fraumeni syndrome or ataxia-telangiectasia may have a slightly increased risk of developing ovarian cancer.\nThere may be other hereditary syndromes linked to these types of cancer, including small-cell carcinoma with an inherited SMARCA4 \nmutation and Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors with DICER1 syndrome. Research in this area is ongoing. Only genetic testing can determine whether a person has a genetic mutation. Most experts strongly recommend that people who are considering genetic testing first talk with a genetic counselor. This expert is specially trained and can explain the risks and benefits of genetic testing.\nA woman’srisk of developing ovarian/fallopian tube cancer increases with age. Women of all ages have a risk of these cancers, but women over 50 are more likely to develop these cancers. About half of the women diagnosed with ovarian/fallopian tube cancer are 63 years or older.\n Recent studies show that women who were obese in early adulthood, but not those who gain weight later in life, may have an increased risk of developing ovarian/fallopian tube cancer. Women who are obese are more likely to die from any condition, including ovarian/fallopian tube cancer.\nWhen the inside lining of a woman’s uterus grows outside of the uterus, affecting other nearby organs, it is called endometriosis. This condition can cause several problems, but effective treatment is available. Researchers are continuing to study whether endometriosis is a risk factor for ovarian cancer. It may increase the risk of certain types of ovarian cancer, including clear cell and endometrioid ovarian cancers.\nWomen of North American, Northern European, or Ashkenazi Jewish heritage have an increased risk of ovarian cancer. People of some of these ethnicities also have higher risks of BRCA\n mutations.\nWomen may have an increased risk of ovarian/fallopian tube cancer if they:\nStarted their menstrual periods much earlier than the average age of about 12\nHave never given birth to a child\nHave unexplained infertility (the medical inability to have a child)\nHave not taken birth control pills\nEntered menopause much later than the average age of 51.\nWomen who have taken estrogen-only hormone replacement therapy (HRT) after menopause may have a higher risk of ovarian/fallopian tube cancer. The risk becomes higher the longer a woman uses the therapy. The risk decreases over time after the therapy ends.\nFertility drugs were once thought to increase the risk of ovarian/fallopian tube cancer. It has been shown that they do not increase the risk.\n"

        "text": "Prevention\nDifferent factors cause different types of cancer. Researchers continue to look into what factors cause ovarian/fallopian tube cancer, including ways to prevent it. Although there is no proven way to completely prevent ovarian/fallopian tube cancer, you may be able to lower your risk. Talk with your health care team for more information about your personal risk of cancer.\nResearch has shown that certain factors may reduce a woman's risk of developing ovarian/fallopian tube cancer:\n Women who took oral contraceptives for 3 or more years are 30% to 50% less likely to develop ovarian/fallopian tube cancer. The decrease in risk may last for 30 years after a woman stops taking the pills. Intrauterine devices (IUDs) have also been linked to a decreased risk in ovarian cancer.\nThe longer a woman breastfeeds, the lower her risk of developing ovarian/fallopian tube cancer.\nThe more full-term pregnancies a woman has had, the lower her risk of ovarian/fallopian tube cancer.\nWomen who have had a hysterectomy or a tubal ligation may have a lower risk of developing ovarian/fallopian tube cancer. A hysterectomy is the removal of the uterus and, sometimes, the cervix. Tubal ligation is having the fallopian tubes “tied” or closed surgically to prevent pregnancy. Doctors recommend a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, which is the removal of both ovaries and fallopian tubes, for women with a high risk of ovarian/fallopian tube cancer. After a woman has given birth to all of the children she intends to have, she may choose to have her fallopian tubes removed at the time of abdominal surgery for other purposes or during a caesarean section, also called a c-section.\nFor women with high-risk genetic mutations such as BRCA1\n, BRCA2\n, and the genes related to Lynch syndrome, having the ovaries and fallopian tubes removed after having children is recommended to prevent ovarian/fallopian tube cancers as well as possibly reduce the risk of breast cancer. This can reduce ovarian/fallopian tube cancer risk by as much as 96%. If performed before menopause occurs naturally, there may be a 40% to 70% reduction in the risk of developing breast cancer, particularly in women with BRCA2\n mutations.\nIt is very important for women who are considering preventive surgery to talk with their doctors and genetic counselors so they can understand the risks and side effects of the surgery compared to their personal risk of developing ovarian/fallopian tube cancer.\n"

Use the menu to see other pages.\nOvarian/fallopian tube cancer can be hard to find in its earliest stages. That’s because the symptoms are often vague until these diseases are advanced. However, early-stage ovarian/fallopian tube cancer versus advanced-stage ovarian/fallopian tube cancer is not just a factor of delayed diagnosis but also of biology. Most stage I ovarian/fallopian tube cancers are clear cell, endometrioid, and mucinous with only a small percent being high-grade serous cancers (HGSC). Most advanced-stage ovarian cancers, however, are HGSC.\nIt is rare for women with ovarian/fallopian tube cancer to not have any symptoms. However, it’s also important to note that these symptoms are not specific to ovarian/fallopian tube cancer and may be caused by a different medical condition that is not cancer. Often symptoms between early- and late-stage ovarian cancer will be similar.\nSymptoms for ovarian/fallopian tube cancer may include:\nAbdominal bloating\nPelvic or abdominal pain\nDifficulty eating or feeling full quickly\nUrinary symptoms, such as urgency or frequency\nFatigue\nUpset stomach\nIndigestion\nBack pain\nPain with intercourse\nConstipation\nMenstrual irregularities\nSwelling in the pelvis or abdomen\nVaginal discharge, which may be clear, white, or tinged with blood\nFor many women, these symptoms can be caused by reasons not related to ovarian cancer and can occur often. However, it is important for women to acknowledge these symptoms if they begin and are different from what is normal for their bodies. Women who have any of the symptoms listed above every day for more than a few weeks should see their primary care doctor or a gynecologist. A gynecologist is a doctor who specializes in treating diseases of the female reproductive organs. Early medical evaluation may help find cancer at the earliest possible stage of the disease, when it is easier to treat successfully.\nYour doctor will ask how long and how often you’ve been experiencing the symptom(s), in addition to other questions. This is to help figure out the cause of the problem, called a diagnosis.\nIf the doctor diagnoses cancer, relieving symptoms remains an important part of cancer care and treatment. This may be called palliative care or supportive care. It is often started soon after diagnosis and is continued throughout treatment. Be sure to talk with your health care team about the symptoms you experience, including any new symptoms or a change in symptoms.\nThe \nnext section in this guide is Diagnosis\n. It explains what tests may be needed to learn more about the cause of the symptoms. Use the menu to choose a different section to read in this guide.\n"

        "text": " You will find a list of common tests, procedures, and scans that doctors use to find the cause of a medical problem. Use the menu to see other pages.\nDoctors use many tests to find, or diagnose, cancer. They do tests to learn if cancer has spread to another part of the body from where it started. If this happens, it is called metastasis. For example, imaging tests can show if the cancer has spread. Imaging tests, such as ultrasound, computed tomography (CT) scan, or magnetic resonance imagining (MRI), show pictures of the inside of the body. Doctors may do tests to learn which treatments could work best.\nIf your primary care doctor suspects that you might have ovarian/fallopian tube cancer, you should see a gynecologic oncologist. A gynecologic oncologist is a doctor who specializes in treating cancers of the female reproductive system.\nDoing laboratory testing of the ovarian and fallopian tube tissues is the only sure way for the doctor to know if an area of the body has cancer. In most cases, this requires surgical removal of these organs.\nThis section describes options for diagnosing ovarian/fallopian tube cancer. Not all tests listed below will be used for every person. Your doctor may consider these factors when choosing a diagnostic test:\nThe type of cancer suspected\nYour signs and symptoms\nYour age and general health\nThe results of earlier medical tests\nWhile early detection and treatment is important, this is often not possible for ovarian/fallopian tube/peritoneal cancer. The reasons for this are because CA-125, which is tested using blood samples, can be at a higher level due to many benign conditions, especially endometriosis, fibroids, and pelvic inflammatory disease, in addition to pregnancy and menstruation. Meanwhile, many benign conditions may look cancerous on a transvaginal ultrasound. Large clinical trials have shown no benefit in screening the general population for ovarian/fallopian tube/peritoneal cancer using these methods.\nThe annual Pap test that many women receive from their gynecologist does not check for ovarian cancer. It only identifies cervical cancer. About 70% of epithelial ovarian/fallopian tube cancers, particularly high-grade serous cancers, are not found until the disease is in an advanced stage and has spread to other parts of the body, most commonly the abdomen.\nThe following tests may be used to diagnose ovarian/fallopian tube cancer:\n Usually, the first exam is the abdominal-pelvic examination. The doctor feels the uterus, vagina, ovaries, bladder, and rectum to check for any unusual changes, such as a mass. Some cancers are very small before they spread and cannot be reliably felt and detected by pelvic examination. A Pap test, usually done with a pelvic examination, is not likely to find or diagnose these cancers because that test is used to find cervical cancer.\n There is a blood test that measures a substance called CA-125, which is a tumor marker. This marker is found in higher levels in women with ovarian/fallopian tube cancer. Women younger than 50 with conditions such as endometriosis, pelvic inflammatory disease, and uterine fibroids may also have an increased CA-125 level. This test is more accurate in women who have experienced menopause. Other tumor marker tests, such as HE4, are available, but none of these markers have been found to be effective for the early detection of these cancers.\n An ultrasound probe is inserted in the vagina and aimed at the ovaries and uterus. An ultrasound uses sound waves to create a picture of the ovaries, including surrounding tissues, cysts, and tumors. Researchers are studying whether this test can help with early detection of ovarian/fallopian tube cancer.\n A CT scan takes pictures of the inside of the body using x-rays taken from different angles. An x-ray is a way to create a picture of the structures inside the body using a small amount of radiation. A computer combines these pictures into a 3-dimensional image that shows any abnormalities or tumors. Sometimes, a special dye called a contrast medium is given before the scan to provide better detail on the image. This dye can be injected into a patient’s vein or given as a pill or liquid to swallow. A CT scan can be used to measure the tumor’s size and find out how much the cancer has spread. While CT scan technology has continued to evolve, tumors or abnormalities smaller than about 5 millimeters (1/5th of an inch) are difficult to see.\n \nA PET scan may be combined with a CT scan (see above), called a PET-CT scan. However, you may hear your doctor refer to this procedure as just a PET scan. A PET scan is a way to create pictures of organs and tissues inside the body. A small amount of a radioactive sugar substance is injected into the patient’s body. This sugar substance is taken up by cells that use the most energy. Because cancer tends to actively use energy, it absorbs more of the radioactive substance. A scanner detects this substance to produce images of the inside of the body. A PET-CT scan may only be used for certain people with ovarian/fallopian tube cancer.\n An MRI uses magnetic fields, not x-rays, to produce detailed images of the body. MRI can be used to measure the tumor’s size. A special dye called a contrast medium is given before the scan to create a clearer picture. This dye can be injected into a patient’s vein.\n. This is a medical procedure that removes peritoneal fluid that has built up in a person’s abdomen. This fluid buildup may be called ascites. A sample of the fluid is examined under a microscope for signs of cancer (see “Biopsy,” below).\nA biopsy is the removal of a small amount of tissue for examination under a microscope. Other tests can suggest that cancer is present, but only a biopsy can make a definitive diagnosis. A pathologist analyzes the sample(s). A pathologist is a doctor who specializes in interpreting laboratory tests and evaluating cells, tissues, and organs to diagnose disease.\nBiopsies for ovarian/fallopian tube cancer are often done as part of the first surgery. During the surgery, doctors may remove as much of the tumor as possible (see Types of Treatment). A tumor sample will be analyzed by a pathologist after the surgery is over. A biopsy alone is sometimes used if the diagnosis is uncertain or if there is too much tumor to remove initially with surgery. This is usually done when chemotherapy is planned as the first treatment, with possible surgery afterward.\n In addition to genetic testing for inherited, or germline, mutations (see Risk Factors and Prevention), your doctor may also recommend running laboratory tests on a tumor to identify specific genes, proteins, and other factors unique to the tumor. Genetic changes in the tumor cells are called somatic mutations. ASCO recommends that all women with epithelial ovarian/fallopian tube cancer who do not carry a germline mutation receive somatic tumor testing. Somatic tumor testing can look for BRCA1\n and BRCA2\n mutations in the tumor. And women with clear cell, endometrioid, mucinous, or other types of epithelial ovarian cancer should also be offered somatic testing for a feature called mismatch repair defect (dMMR). This means the tumor does not repair damage to its DNA very well, which can lead the tumor to developing DNA mutations, or changes. Results of these tests can help determine your treatment options.\nThis information is based on ASCO recommendations for Germline and Somatic Tumor Testing in Epithelial Ovarian Cancer. Please note that this link takes you to a separate ASCO website.\nAfter diagnostic tests are done, your doctor will review all of the results with you. As noted above, surgery and an examination of the lymph nodes may be needed before results are complete. If the diagnosis is cancer, these test results help the doctor describe the cancer. This is called staging.\n"

        "text": " You will learn how doctors describe a cancer’s growth or spread. This is called the stage. Use the menu to see other pages.\nStaging is a way of describing where a cancer is located, if or where it has spread, and whether it is affecting other parts of the body.\nDoctors use diagnostic tests to find out a cancer's stage, so staging may not be complete until all of the tests are finished. Knowing the stage helps the doctor decide what kind of treatment is best. Knowing the stage can help predict a patient's prognosis, which is the chance of recovery. There are different stage descriptions for different types of cancer. For ovarian/fallopian tube cancer, the staging system developed by the International Federation of Obstetrics and Gynecology (Federation Internationale de Gynecologie et d'Obstetrique or FIGO) is used.\nFIGO stages for ovarian, fallopian tube, and peritoneal cancer\nThe stage provides a common way of describing the cancer, enabling doctors to work together to plan the best treatments. Doctors assign the stage of cancer using the FIGO system.\nThe cancer is only in the ovaries or fallopian tubes.\n The cancer is only inside 1 ovary or fallopian tube. No cancer is found on the ovarian or fallopian tube surface or in the abdomen.\n The cancer is in both ovaries or fallopian tubes. No cancer is found on the surface of the ovary or fallopian tube or in the peritoneal fluid or washings.\n The cancer is in 1 or both ovaries or fallopian tubes, with any of the following:\n The tumor ruptures while it is being removed surgically, called intraoperative surgical spill.\n The tumor wall is ruptured before surgery, or there is cancer on the surface of the ovary or fallopian tube.\n Cancer cells are found in fluid buildup in the abdominal cavity, called ascites, or in the samples of fluid from the peritoneal cavity taken during surgery.\nThe cancer involves 1 or both of the ovaries or fallopian tubes and has spread below the pelvis, or it is peritoneal cancer.\n The cancer has spread to the uterus and/or fallopian tubes and/or the ovaries.\n The cancer has spread to other tissues within the pelvis.\nThe cancer involves 1 or both of the ovaries or fallopian tubes, or it is peritoneal cancer. It has spread to the peritoneum outside the pelvis and/or to lymph nodes in the retroperitoneum (lymph nodes along the major blood vessels, such as the aorta) behind the abdomen.\n The cancer has spread to the retroperitoneal lymph nodes, which are found at the back of the abdomen, but not to the peritoneal surfaces.\n Metastases are 10 millimeters (mm) or smaller.\nMetastases are larger than 10 mm.\nThe cancer has spread microscopically from the pelvis to the abdomen. Cancer may or may not have spread to lymph nodes in the back of the abdomen.\n: The cancer has visibly spread past the pelvis to the abdomen and is 2 centimeters (cm) or smaller, with or without spread to the retroperitoneal lymph nodes. A centimeter is roughly equal to the width of a standard pen or pencil.\nThe cancer has visibly spread past the pelvis to the abdomen and is larger than 2 cm, with or without spread to the retroperitoneal lymph nodes.\nThe cancer has spread to organs outside of the abdominal area.\n The cancer has spread to fluid around the lungs.\n The cancer has spread to the liver or spleen or to organs beyond the abdomen, including lymph nodes in the groin outside of the abdominal cavity.\nGrade\nDoctors also describe these types of cancer by their grade. The grade describes how much cancer cells look like healthy cells when viewed under a microscope.\nThe doctor compares the cancerous tissue with healthy tissue. This helps the doctor predict how quickly the cancer may spread and may help the health care team make decisions about the treatment plan. Healthy tissue usually contains many different types of cells grouped together. If the cancer looks similar to healthy tissue and has different cell groupings, it is called “differentiated” or a “low-grade tumor.” If the cancerous tissue looks very different from healthy tissue, it is called “poorly differentiated” or a “high-grade tumor.” In general, the lower the tumor’s grade, the better the prognosis.\nSome tumors are called borderline tumors, which are tumors of low malignant potential (LMP). They are very different from high-grade cancers and represent about 10% to 15% of epithelial ovarian/fallopian tube neoplasms, which are abnormal growths of cells. Borderline tumors typically occur in younger women and are often confined to an ovary but can involve both ovaries. Most are serous tumors and can be associated with the presence of a tumor in the peritoneum, which can be benign or invasive.\nMost epithelial ovarian/fallopian tube cancers are the serous type, and they are graded as low-grade serous carcinoma (LGSC) or high-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC). These tumors have different genetic alterations and biology.\nOther types of ovarian/fallopian tube cancer, such as endometrioid cancers, may be given these grades:\n  This means the cells look and are organized within the tumor like normal cells. These tumors tend to grow slowly.\n  It shares features between well and poorly differentiated. Grade 2 is not commonly used.\n All or most cells appear very abnormal and do not have any normal tissue structure. These tumors tend to grow fast and can spread rapidly.\nInformation about the cancer’s stage and grade will help the doctor recommend a specific treatment plan.

Clinical trials can test a new drug, a new combination of standard treatments, or new doses of standard drugs or other treatments. These drugs may be given through a vein or taken orally. Clinical trials are an option to consider for treatment and care for all stages of cancer. Talk with your doctor if you are interested in a clinical trial about your eligibility, potential benefits, and the potential challenges of joining a clinical trial, including cost and the geographic location of the trial. Your doctor can help you consider all your treatment options. Learn more about clinical trials in the About Clinical Trials and Latest Research sections of this guide.\nTreatment overview\nIn cancer care, different types of doctors often work together to create a patient’s overall treatment plan that combines different types of treatments. This is called a multidisciplinary team. Cancer care teams include a variety of other health care professionals, such as physician assistants, nurse practitioners, oncology nurses, social workers, pharmacists, counselors, dietitians, and others.\nDescriptions of the common types of treatments used for ovarian/fallopian tube cancers are described below. Your care plan also includes treatment for symptoms and side effects, an important part of cancer care.\nTreatment options and recommendations depend on several factors, including the type, stage, and grade of the cancer, possible side effects, and the patient’s preferences and overall health or personal goals, such as a woman’s age and any plans to have children in the future.\nTake time to learn about all of your treatment options and be sure to ask questions about things that are unclear. Talk with your doctor about the goals of each treatment and what you can expect while receiving the treatment. These types of talks are called \"shared decision making.\" Shared decision making is when you and your doctors work together to choose treatments that fit the goals of your care. Shared decision making is particularly important for ovarian, fallopian tube, and peritoneal cancer because there are different treatment options. Learn more about making treatment decisions.\n"

        "text": "Surgery\nSurgery is an important treatment for these types of cancer. A gynecologic oncologist is a doctor who specializes in the treatment of gynecologic cancers, including surgery and medications such as chemotherapy.\nAs mentioned in Diagnosis, surgery is often needed to find out the complete extent of the disease. The goal is to provide an accurate stage. Minimally invasive surgery is often used to confirm a diagnosis and to determine if a debulking procedure (see below) should be done at the time of diagnosis or after chemotherapy has been given first. This is important because imaging tests aren’t always able to see the full extent of a disease.\nFor those patients with cancer that is confined to the ovary who proceed to have a debulking procedure, the surgery will also include a staging procedure that may involve the removal of various tissues, including lymph nodes, to see if there is evidence that the cancer has spread. For those patients with advanced cancer, removing as much of the cancer as possible is the goal. This procedure has been shown to provide the best benefit when combined with chemotherapy (see below) after surgery.\nThere are several surgical options for ovarian/fallopian tube cancer. The stage of the tumor determines the types of surgery. Sometimes doctors perform 2 or more procedures during the same surgery:\n This surgery involves removal of the ovaries and fallopian tubes. If both ovaries and both fallopian tubes are removed, it is called a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. If the woman wants to become pregnant in the future and has early-stage cancer, it may be possible to remove only 1 ovary and 1 fallopian tube if the cancer is located in only 1 ovary. That surgery is called a unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. For women with a germ cell type of ovarian tumor, often only the ovary with the tumor needs to be removed, which preserves the woman’s ability to become pregnant.\n This surgery focuses on the removal of a woman’s uterus and, if necessary, surrounding tissue. If only the uterus is removed, it is called a partial hysterectomy. A total hysterectomy is when a woman’s uterus and cervix are removed.\n During this procedure, the surgeon may remove lymph nodes in the pelvis and paraortic areas.\n This is surgery to remove the thin tissue that covers the stomach and intestines.\n This surgery is used for women with metastatic cancer, which is cancer that has spread to another part of the body. The goal of cytoreductive surgery is to remove as much tumor as is safely possible. This may include removing tissue from nearby organs, such as the spleen, liver, and part of the small bowel or colon. This may also involve removing part of each of these organs. This procedure can help reduce a person’s symptoms, as it removes masses that may be pressing on other organs. It may help increase the effectiveness of other treatment(s) given after surgery, such as chemotherapy, to control the disease that remains. If the disease has spread beyond the ovaries, fallopian tubes, or peritoneum, doctors may use chemotherapy to shrink the tumor before cytoreductive or debulking surgery. This is called neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Your doctor may also administer chemotherapy during the time of surgery. A newly described method of this is called hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC).\nDebulking surgery should be performed by an experienced gynecologic oncologist. Talk with your doctor before surgery about the risks and benefits of this procedure. Ask about the surgeon’s experience with debulking surgery and whether the surgery will be performed in a minimally invasive way or by an open incision. Sometimes, the surgery can be done robotically. Talk with your doctor about the different surgical options.\nSide effects of surgery\nSurgery can cause mild or more severe side effects. It typically causes short-term pain and tenderness. If there is pain, the doctor will prescribe an appropriate medication. For several days after the operation, you may have difficulty emptying your bladder (urinating) and/or having bowel movements. Surgery can also cause more severe effects, including infection, bleeding, or injury to other organs.\nIf the surgeon removes both ovaries, a woman can no longer become pregnant. The loss of both ovaries eliminates the body's source of sex hormones, resulting in early menopause. Soon after surgery, a woman is likely to have menopausal symptoms, including hot flashes and vaginal dryness.\nStudies have shown that women who have their surgery performed by a gynecologic oncologist are more likely to be successfully treated with surgery and have fewer side effects.\nBefore surgery, talk with your health care team about the possible side effects from the specific surgery you will have.

        "text": "Chemotherapy\nChemotherapy is the use of drugs to destroy cancer cells, usually by keeping the cancer cells from growing, dividing, and making more cells or by outright destroying the cancer cells.\nA chemotherapy regimen, or schedule, usually consists of a specific number of cycles given over a set period of time. A patient may receive 1 drug at a time or a combination of different drugs given at the same time. The type of the chemotherapy used depends on several factors. Patients may be given chemotherapy before or after surgery or as a primary treatment option.\nIf the chemotherapy stops or slows the cancer, then maintenance therapy with targeted treatments may be used for certain patients (see \"Targeted therapy,\" below).\nNeoadjuvant chemotherapy\nNeoadjuvantchemotherapy is a medical term to describe chemotherapy that is given before surgery. It is done to reduce the size of a tumor before surgery. It is usually started after a biopsy, so the doctors can determine where the tumor began. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy is usually given for 3 to 4 cycles before considering surgery, called interval surgery. This treatment usually consists of carboplatin (available as a generic drug) given intravenously with paclitaxel (Taxol) or other drugs. The typical treatment cycle is to be given these drugs every 3 weeks. Talk with your doctor about which scheduling option is best for your treatment plan.\nIn 2016, the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) and the Society of Gynecologic Oncology (SGO) released a joint clinical practice guideline on the use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy to treat women with newly diagnosed, advanced ovarian/fallopian tube cancer. Listen to a podcast about what this treatment guideline means for patients.\nAdjuvant chemotherapy\nAdjuvant chemotherapy is a medical term to describe chemotherapy that is given after surgery to destroy any remaining cancer. For these types of cancer, the specific drugs typically are carboplatin given with paclitaxel or other drugs intravenously (IV). Most of these drugs are given once every 3 weeks.\nAnother approach is called “dose-dense” chemotherapy. This is when paclitaxel is given weekly instead of every 3 weeks. Research studies have shown conflicting results on the effectiveness of this approach. Some studies show better outcomes with dose-dense chemotherapy, and others show that the outcomes are the same. Recent clinical trials in the United States and Europe did not show a benefit of dose-dense chemotherapy, compared to chemotherapy given every 3 weeks in contrast to a clinical trial from Japan.\nAdjuvant chemotherapy can also be infused directly into the abdomen through a second port. This is called intraperitoneal or “IP” chemotherapy. This approach may be considered for women with stage III cancer after a debulking surgery that removes all visible disease. However, the effectiveness of IP chemotherapy is not clear. While some research studies have shown that IP treatment may offer more benefit than IV treatment in some patients, more recent research has shown no difference between IV and IP chemotherapy, especially when bevacizumab (Avastin) is added to the treatment.\nA treatment plan that adds bevacizumab to adjuvant chemotherapy with carboplatin and paclitaxel, followed by a course of bevacizumab alone, was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2018. Bevacizumab is a targeted therapy that stops blood vessel growth (see \"Targeted therapy,\" below). This adjuvant treatment is approved for women with stage III or stage IV ovarian/fallopian tube/peritoneal cancer. In general, bevacizumab used for ovarian/fallopian tube cancer has prolonged the time before the cancer returns in some patients.\nTalk with your doctor about which plan is best for your situation. With each of these approaches, doctors consider a variety of factors, such as age, kidney function, and other existing health problems before recommending a treatment schedule.\nSide effects of chemotherapy\nFor ovarian, fallopian tube, and peritoneal cancer, the side effects of chemotherapy depend on the individual and the dose used. Side effects can include fatigue, risk of infection, nausea and vomiting, hair loss, loss of appetite, peripheral neuropathy, and diarrhea. These side effects usually go away after treatment is finished.\nPossible side effects of chemotherapy include difficulty with concentration and memory. For example, the patient may have issues with attention span or memory, sometimes called “chemobrain.” Other possible side effects include losing the ability to become pregnant, called infertility, and early menopause. Rarely, certain drugs may cause some hearing lossor kidney damage. Patients may be given extra fluid intravenously to protect their kidneys. Before treatment begins, patients should talk with their health care team about possible short-term and long-term side effects of the specific drugs they will receive. It is important to note that many side effects can be reduced by adjusting the dose and/or schedule.\nLearn more about the basics of chemotherapy.\n"

        "topic": "Treatment:Targeted therapies",
        "text": "Targeted therapy (updated 08/2020\n)\nTargeted therapy is a treatment that targets the cancer’s specific genes, proteins, or the tissue environment that contributes to cancer growth and survival. This type of treatment blocks the growth and spread of cancer cells and limits damage to healthy cells.\nNot all tumors have the same targets. To find the most effective treatment, your doctor may run tests to identify the genes, proteins, and other factors in your tumor. This helps doctors better match each patient with the most effective treatment whenever possible. In addition, research studies continue to find out more about specific molecular targets and new treatments directed at them. Learn more about the basics of targeted treatments.\nFor ovarian/fallopian tube cancer, \nsome targeted therapy drugs are directed at specific genes that might be found with abnormalities in certain types of epithelial ovarian/fallopian tube cancer. Standard chemotherapy has been effective in treating most ovarian/fallopian tube cancer. Typically, about 20% of high-grade tumors have mutations in the BRCA\n genes. Other tumor mutations are less common.\nThe BRCA\n mutation, even if found only in the tumor and not in the blood, may increase the effectiveness of certain classes of drugs, such as poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors (see below).\nOther types of less common ovarian/fallopian tube cancer include low-grade serous, endometrioid, clear cell, and mucinous cancers. These tumors have a variety of mutations, including BRAF, PI3KCA, \nand PTEN,\n which mean targeted treatment may be available.\nPARP inhibitors block an enzyme involved in repairing damaged DNA. By blocking this enzyme, DNA inside cancer cells may be less likely to be repaired, leading to cell death and possibly slowing down or stopping tumor growth. The BRCA\n genes (BRCA1\n and BRCA2\n) are normally involved in DNA repair, and a mutation in these genes interferes with this pathway function. PARP inhibitors make it difficult for cells that otherwise have a BRCA\n mutation to grow and divide.\nPARP inhibitors are also effective in women who do not have  mutations, particularly in those who have cancer that has a deficiency in repairing DNA damage. This is called homologous recombination deficiency (HRD). This includes people with platinum-sensitive recurrent disease (see more below). There are tests that can be done to see if a tumor has evidence of HRD and the patient could benefit from treatment with a PARP inhibitor.  PARP inhibitors may be used for maintenance therapy after first- or second-line platinum-based therapy and to treat recurrent cancer (see sections below). ASCO does not recommend that people with early-stage (stage I or II) epithelial ovarian cancer receive PARP inhibitors in combination with first platinum-based treatment. ASCO also does not recommend using PARP inhibitors more than once in the overall treatment plan.\nThis is an active area of research. Talk with your doctor about the potential benefits and risks of PARP inhibitors.\nDrugs calledanti-angiogenesis inhibitors block the action of a protein called vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). These drugs have been shown to increase the cancer’s response to treatment and delay the time it takes for the cancer to return. VEGF promotes angiogenesis, which is the formation of new blood vessels. Because a tumor needs nutrients delivered by blood vessels to grow and spread, the goal of anti-angiogenesis therapies is to “starve” the tumor.\nBevacizumab, an antibody that binds VEGF and prevents it from being active, has been shown to be effective in treating ovarian/fallopian tube cancer. It may be combined with chemotherapy to treat stage III or stage IV disease (see \"Chemotherapy,\" above). It is also used as a maintenance drug (see below).\nMaintenance therapy using targeted therapy\nMaintenance therapy is a medical term to describe treatment used to reduce the risk of cancer coming back, called a recurrence, or to delay the time to recurrence. The drugs are used to “maintain” a clinical remission, which is when there is no evidence of disease after the course of chemotherapy treatment has been completed.\nTargeted therapy is used to maintain remission in women whose ovarian/fallopian tube/peritoneal cancer has completely responded to their initial chemotherapy and the disease is in a clinical remission.\nNiraparib (Zejula), olaparib (Lynparza), and rucaparib (Rubraca) are PARP inhibitors approved by the FDA for use in maintenance therapy for ovarian/fallopian tube/peritoneal cancer. If the cancer has been slowed or put into remission by first-line platinum-based chemotherapy, ASCO recommends maintenance therapy with olaparib or niraparib for patients newly diagnosed with stage III or IV ovarian cancer. People who have a  mutation should be offered olaparib or niraparib as maintenance therapy. Those with HGSC or high grade endometrioid ovarian cancer should be offered niraparib. If treatment with bevacizumab and chemotherapy has stopped or slowed the cancer, olaparib plus bevacizumab may be used as maintenance therapy for stage III or IV HGSC or endometrioid ovarian cancer in those with a  mutation, have cancer with HRD, or both.\nIf second-line platinum chemotherapy stopped or slowed the cancer, maintenance therapy with olaparib, rucaparib, or niraparib is recommended in those who have not already received a PARP inhibitor. Although women with a BRCA mutation will have the highest benefit, all women can potentially receive and benefit from a PARP inhibitor. Recent data show an overall survival benefit with olaparib, and data for the others is still pending at this time.\nPARP inhibitors are taken by mouth daily. Common side effects are nausea, fatigue, vomiting, low blood counts, and altered taste.\nNausea can be treated with an antiemetic medication. If nausea continues or worsens, ASCO recommends lowering the dose of the PARP inhibitor.\nA low red blood cell count, called anemia, should be monitored and may be treated with a blood transfusion. If the anemia still persists or gets worse, the doctor may lower the dose of the PARP inhibitor or give growth factor therapy, which helps produce more blood cells.\nSimilarly, a low white blood cell count will be monitored. If a low white blood cell count, called neutropenia, is severe enough and causes a fever or lasts at least 5 to 7 days, PARP inhibitor treatment should stop until the neutropenia gets better and the dose lowered. If lowered red or white blood cell counts continue even after PARP treatment is stopped, the patient should be checked for myelodysplatic syndromes (MDS) or acute myeloid leukemia(AML). These conditions may be related to PARP inhibitor treatment or other cancer treatments.\nA low platelet count, called thrombocytopenia, may occur in those treated with niraparib. Lowering the dose of the PARP inhibitor or stopping treatment may be needed when this is ongoing or severe. If you have a low body weight or platelet count before starting niraparib, your doctor may recommend starting at a lower dose of niraparib to allow for better tolerance.\nBevacizumab, an anti-angiogenesis inhibitor that is given by vein, is approved by the FDA for maintenance therapy of ovarian/fallopian tube/peritoneal cancer. In 2020, the FDA also approved the combination of bevacizumab with olaparib for maintenance therapy.\nThis information is based on ASCO recommendations for “PARP Inhibitors in the Management of Ovarian Cancer.” Please note that this link takes you to another ASCO website.\n"

It may be used to treat some people with clear cell ovarian cancer after chemotherapy. Occasionally, it can be an option for treating small, localized recurrent cancer. It may also be an option for ovarian/fallopian tube cancer that has spread to other parts of the body. See “Remission and the chance of recurrence” below for more information about treatment options for recurrent ovarian/fallopian tube cancer.\nRadiation therapy is the use of high-energy x-raysor other particles to destroy cancer cells. A doctor who specializes in giving radiation therapy to treat cancer is called a radiation oncologist. The most common type of radiation treatment is called external-beam radiation therapy. This type of radiation is given from a machine outside the body. When radiation treatment is given using implants, it is called internal radiation therapy or brachytherapy. Proton therapy, which uses protons rather than x-rays to treat cancer, may also be used as an alternative to traditional radiation therapy. A radiation therapy regimen, or schedule, usually consists of a specific number of treatments given over a set period of time.\nSide effects from radiation therapy may include fatigue, mild skin reactions, upset stomach, and loose bowel movements. Most side effects go away soon after treatment is finished. Learn more about the basics of radiation therapy.\nFor more information on radiation therapy for gynecologic cancers, see the American Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology's pamphlet (PDF), Radiation Therapy for Gynecologic Cancers\n. \nPlease note that this link takes you to a separate, independent website.\n"

        "text": "Physical, emotional, and social effects of cancer\nCancer and its treatment cause physical symptoms and side effects, as well as emotional, social, and financial effects. Managing all of these effects is called palliative care or supportive care. It is an important part of your care that is included along with treatments intended to slow, stop, or eliminate the cancer.\nPalliative care focuses on improving how you feel during treatment by managing symptoms and supporting patientsand their families with other, non-medical needs. Any person, regardless of age or type and stage of cancer, may receive this type of care. And it often works best when it is started right after a cancer diagnosis. People who receive palliative care along with treatment for the cancer often have less severe symptoms, better quality of life, and report that they are more satisfied with treatment.\nPalliative treatments vary widely and often include medication, nutritional changes, relaxation techniques, emotional and spiritual support, and other therapies. You may also receive palliative treatments similar to those meant to get rid of the cancer, such as chemotherapy, surgery, or radiation therapy.\nBefore treatment begins, talk with your doctor about the goals of each treatment in the treatment plan. You should also talk about the possible side effects of the specific treatment plan and palliative care options.\nDuring treatment, your health care team may ask you to answer questions about your symptoms and side effects and to describe each problem. Be sure to tell the health care team if you are experiencing a problem. This helps the health care team treat any symptoms and side effects as quickly as possible. It can also help prevent more serious problems in the future.\nLearn more about the importance of tracking side effects in another part of this guide.

Learn more about getting a second opinion before starting treatment, so you are comfortable with your chosen treatment plan.\nNew treatments for these types of cancer include experimental combinations of chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and another type of systemic therapy called immunotherapy, also called biologic therapy. These combinations are designed to boost the body’s natural defenses to fight the cancer (see Latest Research). Because the benefits of these options are still being studied, their risks must be weighed against possible improvements in symptoms and lifespan. Palliative care will be important to help relieve symptoms and side effects.\nFor most people, a diagnosis of metastatic cancer is very stressful and difficult. You and your family are encouraged to talk about how you feel with doctors, nurses, social workers, or other members of the health care team.

        "text": "Remission and the chance of recurrence\nA remission is when cancer cannot be detected in the body and there are no symptoms. This may also be called having “no evidence of disease” or NED.\nA remission may be temporary or permanent. This uncertainty causes many people to worry that the cancer will come back. It is important to talk with your doctor about the possibility of the cancer returning. This is particularly important after treatment for ovarian/fallopian tube cancer, as many women experience at least 1 recurrence. Understanding your risk of recurrence and the treatment options may help you feel more prepared if the cancer does return. Learn more about coping with the fear of recurrence.\nIf the cancer returns after the original treatment, it is called recurrent cancer. It may come back in the same place (called a local recurrence), nearby (regional recurrence), or in another place (distant recurrence).\nWhen this occurs, a new cycle of testing will begin to discover as much as possible about the recurrence. After this testing is done, you and your doctor will talk about the treatment options.\nHow recurrent cancer is treated\nChemotherapy is typically used to treat a recurrence of ovarian, fallopian tube, and peritoneal cancer. A primary goal of the treatment of recurrent disease is to reduce or prevent symptoms of the disease while keeping the side effects of treatment to a minimum. Treatment for women with recurrent disease is generally based on the time since her last treatment using a platinum chemotherapy drug. Platinum chemotherapy drugs include carboplatin and cisplatin. There is also evidence that surgerymay be an effective option for certain patients with recurrent disease, and this should be discussed with your gynecologic oncologist.\nIf the cancer comes back more than 6 months after platinum chemotherapy, doctors call it \"platinum-sensitive disease.\" If the cancer returns in less than 6 months after platinum chemotherapy, doctors call it “platinum-resistant disease.” However, doctors are now starting to consider other factors than just the cancer's previous response to platinum chemotherapy when deciding which treatment to use for recurrent ovarian, fallopian tube, and peritoneal cancers.\nTreatment for platinum-sensitive recurrent disease \nIf the cancer is localized, additional surgery may be beneficial. Talk about this with your doctor. Surgery is usually considered only if the time following chemotherapy has been 1 year or longer. If the cancer comes back to more than 1 place in the body, chemotherapy is the appropriate next step. For women with platinum-sensitive disease (greater than 6 months from the last dose of platinum), clinical trials suggest using IV carboplatin and combining it with liposomal doxorubicin (Doxil), paclitaxel, or gemcitabine (Gemzar) may be beneficial.\nClinical trials showed the addition of bevacizumab to carboplatin combinations extended the time before the disease came back but did not change how long patients lived. You should discuss the risks and possible benefits of this approach with your doctor.\nThe following PARP inhibitors are approved for the treatment of recurrent ovarian, fallopian tube, and peritoneal cancer:\n Niraparib is approved for maintenance therapy in adults with recurrent ovarian/fallopian tube/peritoneal cancer and can also be used after treatment for recurrent disease with HRD (see “Maintenance therapy using targeted therapy,” above).\n Olaparib is approved for the treatment of persistent or recurrent ovarian/fallopian tube/peritoneal cancer in women who have the BRCA\n mutation and who have received 3 or more lines of chemotherapy. The SOLO2 clinical trial investigated the use of olaparib for maintenance therapy, which was approved by the FDA. The FDA also approved the use of olaparib in combination with bevacizumab for maintenance therapy.\n Rucaparib is approved for the treatment of BRCA\n-positive advanced ovarian/fallopian tube/peritoneal cancer in women who have received 2 or more lines of chemotherapy. The Ariel3 clinical trial is investigating the use of rucaparib for maintenance therapy.\nASCO recommends treatment with a PARP inhibitor for women with recurrent ovarian cancer who:\nHave not received a PARP inhibitor and have a  or  mutation.\nHave not received a PARP inhibitor, the cancer has HRD, and the cancer has not recurred within 6 months of last dose of platinum chemotherapy.\nASCO does not recommend the use of PARP inhibitors in combination with chemotherapy, targeted therapy, or immunotherapy for the treatment of recurrent cancer, except in clinical trials.\nTreatment for platinum-resistant recurrent disease \nIn general, if the cancer returns in less than 6 months after platinum chemotherapy, the next chemotherapy is chosen from a list of medications that have all shown similar ability to shrink cancer. Doctors choose them based on possible side effects and preference based on schedule of dosing. These medications may include, but are not limited to:\nLiposomal doxorubicin\nPaclitaxel\nDocetaxel (Taxotere)\nNab-paclitaxel (Abraxane)\nGemcitabine\nEtoposide\nPemetrexed (Alimta)\nCyclophosphamide (available as a generic drug)\nTopotecan (Hycamtin)\nVinorelbine (Navelbine)\nIrinotecan (Camptosar)\nFor platinum-resistant cancer, most doctors recommend single and sequential use (1 drug after another) of these medications, but they are sometimes used in combination. ASCO does not recommend PARP inhibitors for the treatment of recurrent ovarian/fallopian tube cancer that is resistant to platinum chemotherapy.\n"

The 4 most common symptoms are bloating, pelvic or abdominal pain, difficulty eating or feeling full quickly, and urinary symptoms (urgency or frequency). However, other symptoms may include persistent indigestion, gas, nausea, diarrhea, or constipation; unexplained weight loss or gain, especially in the abdominal area; abnormal bleeding from the vagina; pain during sexual intercourse; fatigue; and lower back pain.\nIn addition to monitoring symptoms, doctors may be able to diagnose a recurrence by measuring the level of CA-125 in the blood in women whose levels were elevated prior to treatment (see Diagnosis). CA-125 is a substance called a tumor marker that is found in higher levels in women with ovarian/fallopian tube cancer. In 95% of patients who have a recurrence, there is a rise in the CA-125 level. However, sometimes a recurrence can happen without an elevation of this marker, depending on the tumor type.\nWhichever treatment plan you choose, palliative care will be important for relieving symptoms and side effects.\nPeople with recurrent cancer often experience emotions such as disbelief or fear. You are encouraged to talk with the health care team about these feelings and ask about support services to help you cope. Learn more about dealing with cancer recurrence.\n"

If the cancer cannot be cured or controlled, the disease may be called advanced or terminal.\nThis diagnosis is stressful, and for many people, advanced cancer is difficult to discuss. However, it is important to have open and honest conversations with your health care team to express your feelings, preferences, and concerns. The health care team has special skills, experience, and knowledge to support patients and their families and is there to help. Making sure a person is physically comfortable, free from pain, and emotionally supported is extremely important.\nPeople who have advanced cancer and who are expected to live less than 6 months may want to consider hospice care. Hospice care is designed to provide the best possible quality of life for people who are near the end of life. You and your family are encouraged to talk with the health care team about hospice care options, which include hospice care at home, a special hospice center, or other health care locations. Nursing care and special equipment can make staying at home a workable option for many families.

        "text": " You will learn more about clinical trials, which are the main way that new medical approaches are tested to see how well they work. Use the menu to see other pages.\nWhat are clinical trials?\nDoctors and scientists are always looking for better ways to care for people with ovarian/fallopian tube cancer. To make scientific advances, doctors create research studies involving volunteers, called clinical trials. Every drug that is now approved by the FDA was tested in clinical trials.\nClinical trials are used for all types and stages of ovarian, fallopian tube, and peritoneal cancer. Many focus on new treatments to learn if a new treatment is safe, effective, and possibly better than the existing treatments. These types of studies evaluate new drugs, different combinations of treatments, new approaches to radiation therapy or surgery, and new methods of treatment.\nPeople who participate in clinical trials can be some of the first to get a treatment before it is available to the public. However, there are some risks with a clinical trial, including possible side effects and the chance that the new treatment may not work. Clinical trials do, however, always include the standard of care along with the potential of receiving an experimental drug. People are encouraged to talk with their health care team about the pros and cons of joining a specific study.\nSome clinical trials study new ways to relieve symptoms and side effects during treatment. Others study ways to manage the late side effects that may happen a long time after treatment. Talk with your doctor about clinical trials for symptoms and side effects.\nDeciding to join a clinical trial\nPeople decide to participate in clinical trials for many reasons. For some people, a clinical trial is the best treatment option available. Because standard treatments are not perfect, people are often willing to face the added uncertainty of a clinical trial in the hope of a better result. Other people volunteer for clinical trials because they know that these studies are a way to contribute to the progress in treating ovarian/fallopian tube cancer. Even if they do not benefit directly from the clinical trial, their participation may benefit future patients with ovarian/fallopian tube cancers.\nInsurance coverage and the costs of clinical trials differ by location and by study. In some programs, some of the expenses from participating in the clinical trial are reimbursed. In others, they are not. It is important to talk with the research team and your insurance company first to learn if and how your treatment in a clinical trial will be covered. Learn more about health insurance coverage of clinical trials.\nSometimes people have concerns that, in a clinical trial, they may receive no treatment by being given a placebo or a “sugar pill.” When used, placebos are usually combined with standard treatment in most cancer clinical trials. Study participants will always be told when a placebo is used in a study. Find out more about placebos in cancer clinical trials.\nPatient safety and informed consent\nTo join a clinical trial, people must participate in a process known as informed consent. During informed consent, the doctor should:\nDescribe all of the treatment options so that the person understands how the new treatment differs from the standard treatment.\nList all of the risks of the new treatment, which may or may not be different from the risks of standard treatment.\nExplain what will be required of each person in order to participate in the clinical trial, including the number of doctor visits, tests, and the schedule of treatment.\nClinical trials also have certain rules called “eligibility criteria” that help structure the research and keep patients safe. You and the research team will carefully review these criteria together.\nBecause some of the specific subtypes of ovarian/fallopian tube cancer are quite rare, studies focusing only on a subtype are uncommon. However, many clinical trials on ovarian/fallopian tube cancer are open to people with different subtypes because such diseases often respond to the same treatment.\nPeople who participate in a clinical trial may stop participating at any time for personal or medical reasons. This may include that the new treatment is not working or there are serious side effects. Clinical trials are closely monitored by experts who watch for any problems with each study. It is important that people participating in a clinical trial talk with their doctor and researchers about who will be providing their treatment and care during the clinical trial, after the clinical trial ends, and/or if they choose to leave the clinical trial before it ends.\nFinding a clinical trial\nResearch through clinical trials is ongoing for all types of cancer. For specific topics being studied for ovarian, fallopian tube, and peritoneal cancers, learn more in the Latest Research section.\nCancer.Net offers a lot of information about cancer clinical trials in other areas of the website, including a complete section on clinical trials and places to search for clinical trials for a specific type of cancer.\nIn addition, you can find a free video-based educational program about cancer clinical trials in another section of this website.\nThe \nnext section in this guide is Latest Research\n.

        "text": " You will read about the scientific research being done to learn more about this type of cancer and how to treat it. Use the menu to see other pages.\nDoctors are working to learn more about ovarian/fallopian tube cancer. They are looking for ways to prevent these cancers, as well as looking for the best ways to treat them and provide care to people diagnosed with these diseases. The following areas of research may include new options for patients through clinical trials. Most ovarian cancer trials now include patients with fallopian tube and peritoneal cancers. Always talk with your doctor about the best diagnostic and treatment options for you.\n Screening is used to look for cancer before a person has any signs or symptoms. There are no effective screening methods for these diseases suitable for people in the general population who are not having symptoms. A screening method study that uses serial CA-125 blood tests and pelvic ultrasonography for finding early-stage ovarian/fallopian tube cancer has been completed, and it is not clear whether this approach showed a difference in survival. As noted in Diagnosis and Types of Treatment, CA-125 is a substance called a tumor marker that is found in higher levels in women with ovarian/fallopian tube cancer and in women with many benign conditions.This is because it can lead to an increase in unnecessary surgical operations due to \"false positive\" test findings.\nSome have recommended that women at high risk of developing ovarian/fallopian tube/peritoneal cancer because of their family history or presence of BRCA1 \nor BRCA2\nor other high-risk gene mutation(s) (see Risk Factors) should be screened with CA-125 blood tests and transvaginal ultrasound. As stated above, this approach has not been shown to help women live longer or find cancers at an earlier and more curable stage. Therefore, if a high-risk gene mutation exists, the recommendation is to remove both fallopian tubes and ovaries after a woman finishes giving birth to children or around the time she turns 40. Or, if possible, they should be removed 10 years before the age of when her closest relative developed ovarian cancer.\n As described in Types of Treatment, clinical trials are ongoing for many treatments that target different mutations, including KRAS\n, BRAF\n, PI3KCA\n, and PTEN\n. Many other new, targeted treatments are now being studied in clinical trials. Increasingly, doctors are learning about each patient’s individual tumor's biology through molecular testing. This information may be useful in matching patients with a clinical trial for a specific targeted therapy. Learn more about the basics of targeted therapy.\n Immunotherapy is a systemic therapy designed to boost the body’s natural defenses to fight a cancer. It uses materials made either by the body or in a laboratory to bolster, target, or restore immune system function. Researchers are examining whether drugs called checkpoint inhibitors may boost the immune system's ability to destroy cancer cells. Drugs in this category target PD-1, PD-L1, and CTLA4. They have been shown to shrink tumors in other types of cancer, such as melanoma and some lung cancers, and have had some effectiveness for ovarian/fallopian tube cancer.\nCancer vaccines are another type of immunotherapy researchers are testing to use for ovarian/fallopian tube cancer. Some approaches, called “adoptive cell therapy,” use cells called killer T cells from the immune system in an individual patient. Researchers take these cells and grow them in the laboratory, training them to attack certain targets, such as MUC 16 (CA-125), that are found on ovarian/fallopian tube cancer cells. Doctors then put the T cells back into the patient through an IV. This approach, also called chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy, has been used with some success in people with some blood cancers. Clinical trials are opening for ovarian/fallopian tube cancer. Learn more about the basics of immunotherapy and cancer vaccines.\n For treatment of recurrent or later-stage ovarian/fallopian tube cancer, tamoxifen, aromatase inhibitors, and enzalutamide (Xtandi), a blocker of the androgen receptor, are being studied.\n A new area of research is discovering how damaged genes in ovarian/fallopian tube cancer cells can be corrected or replaced. Researchers are studying the use of specially designed viruses that carry normal genes into the core of cancer cells and then replace the defective genes with functional ones.\n Clinical trials are underway to find better ways of reducing symptoms and side effects of standard cancer treatments to improve comfort and quality of life for patients.\nLooking for More About the Latest Research?\nIf you would like additional information about the latest areas of research regarding ovarian/fallopian tube cancer, explore these related items that take you outside of this guide:\nTo find clinical trials specific to your diagnosis, talk with your doctor or search online clinical trial databases now.\nVisit the Cancer.Net Blog to read about recent research in ovarian/fallopian tube cancer and to listen to podcasts with expert perspectives on the topic.\nVisit the website of Conquer Cancer, the ASCO Foundation, to find out how to help support cancer research.

        "text": " You will read about your medical care after cancer treatment is completed and why this follow-up care is important. Use the menu to see other pages.\nCare for people diagnosed with cancer does not end when active treatment has finished. Your health care team will continue to check that the cancer has not come back, manage any side effects, and monitor your overall health. This is called follow-up care.\nYour follow-up care for ovarian/fallopian tube cancer may include regular physical examinations, medical tests, or both. Doctors want to keep track of your recovery in the months and years ahead.\nAlthough there are no specific guidelines for follow-up care for people treated for ovarian/fallopian tube cancer, many doctors recommend a pelvic examination every 2 to 4 months for the first 4 years after treatment and then every 6 months for the next 3 years.\nFor all 3 cancers, other tests may include x-rays, CT scans, MRI scans, ultrasound studies, and blood tests, such as a CA-125 test.\nWomen treated for ovarian/fallopian tube cancer may have an increased risk of breast cancer, colon cancer, or Lynch syndrome (for certain types of ovarian/fallopian tube cancer). Talk with your doctor about screening tests for these medical conditions.\nAny new problem should be reported to your doctor, including pain, loss of appetite or weight, changes in your menstrual cycle, unusual vaginal bleeding, urinary problems, blurred vision, dizziness, coughing, hoarseness, headaches, backaches or abdominal pain, bloating, difficulty eating, or digestive problems that seem unusual or do not go away. These symptoms may be signs that the cancer has come back or signs of another medical condition.\nCancer rehabilitation after treatment may be recommended, and this could mean any of a wide range of services, such as physical therapy, career counseling, pain management, nutritional planning, and/or emotional counseling. The goal of rehabilitation is to help people regain control over many aspects of their lives and remain as independent and productive as possible. Learn more about cancer rehabilitation.\nLearn more about the importance of follow-up care.\nWatching for recurrence\nOne goal of follow-up care is to check for a recurrence, which means that the cancer has come back. Cancer recurs because small areas of cancer cells may remain undetected in the body. Over time, these cells may increase in number until they show up on test results or cause signs or symptoms. During follow-up care, a doctor familiar with your medical history can give you personalized information about your risk of recurrence. Your doctor will ask specific questions about your health. Some people may have blood tests or imaging tests done as part of regular follow-up care, but testing recommendations depend on several factors, including the type and stage of cancer first diagnosed and the types of treatment given.\nThe anticipation before having a follow-up test or waiting for test results can add stress to you or a family member. This is sometimes called “scan-xiety.” Learn more about how to cope with this type of stress.\nManaging long-term and late side effects\nMost people expect to experience side effects when receiving treatment. However, it is often surprising to survivors that some side effects may linger beyond the treatment period. These are called long-term side effects. Other side effects called late effects may develop months or even years afterwards. Long-term and late effects can include both physical and emotional changes.\nTalk with your doctor about your risk of developing such side effects based on the type of cancer, your individual treatment plan, and your overall health. If you had a treatment known to cause specific late effects, you may have certain physical examinations, scans, or blood tests to help find and manage them.\nKeeping personal health records\nYou and your doctor should work together to develop a personalized follow-up care plan. Be sure to discuss any concerns you have about your future physical or emotional health. ASCO offers forms to help keep track of the cancer treatment you received and develop a survivorship care plan when treatment is completed.\nThis is a good time to talk with your doctor about who will lead your follow-up care. Some survivors continue to see their oncologist, while others transition back to the care of their family doctor or another health care professional. This decision depends on several factors, including the type and stage of cancer, side effects, health insurance rules, and your personal preferences.\nIf a doctor who was not directly involved in your cancer care will lead your follow-up care, be sure to share your cancer treatment summary and survivorship care plan forms with them and with all future health care providers. Details about your cancer treatment are very valuable to the health care professionals who will care for you throughout your lifetime.\nThe \nnext section in this guide is Survivorship\n. It describes how to cope with challenges in everyday life after a cancer diagnosis. Use the menu to choose a different section to read in this guide.\n"

Use the menu to see other pages.\nWhat is survivorship?\nThe word “survivorship” means different things to different people. Common definitions include:\nHaving no signs of cancer after finishing treatment.\nLiving with, through, and beyond cancer. According to this definition, cancer survivorship begins at diagnosis and continues during treatment and through the rest of a person’s life.\nSurvivorship is one of the most complicated parts of having cancer. This is because it is different for everyone. Some people continue to receive cancer treatment for a long time to reduce the risk of recurrence or to manage the cancer as a chronic disease. Learn more about living with chronic cancer.\nSurvivors may experience a mixture of strong feelings, including joy, concern, relief, guilt, and fear. Some people say they appreciate life more after a cancer diagnosis and have gained a greater acceptance of themselves. Others become very anxious about their health and uncertain about coping with everyday life.\nSurvivors may feel some stress when their frequent visits to the health care team end after completing treatment. Often, relationships built with the cancer care team provide a sense of security during treatment, and people miss this source of support. This may be especially true when new worries and challenges surface over time, such as any late effects of treatment, emotional challenges including fear of recurrence, sexual health and fertility concerns, and financial and workplace issues.\nEvery survivor has individual concerns and challenges. With any challenge, a good first step is being able to recognize your fears and talk about them. Effective coping requires:\nUnderstanding the challenge you are facing\nThinking through solutions\nAsking for and allowing the support of others\nFeeling comfortable with the course of action you choose\nMany survivors find it helpful to join an in-person support group or an online community of survivors. This allows you to talk with people who have had similar first-hand experiences. Other options for finding support include talking with a friend or member of your health care team, individual counseling, or asking for assistance at the learning resource center of the place where you received treatment.\nChanging role of caregivers\nFamily members and friends may go through periods of transition. A caregiver plays a very important role in supporting a person diagnosed with cancer, providing physical, emotional, and practical care on a daily or as-needed basis. Many caregivers become focused on providing this support, especially if the treatment period lasts for many months or longer.\nAs treatment is completed, the caregiver's role often changes. Eventually, the need for caregiving related to the cancer diagnosis will become much less or come to an end. Caregivers can learn more about adjusting to life after caregiving.\nA new perspective on your health\nFor many people, survivorship serves as a strong motivator to make lifestyle changes.\nPeople recovering from ovarian/fallopian tube cancer are encouraged to follow established guidelines for good health, such as not smoking, limiting alcohol, eating well, and managing stress. Regular physical activity can help rebuild your strength and energy level. Your health care team can help you create an appropriate exercise plan based upon your needs, physical abilities, and fitness level. Learn more about making healthy lifestyle choices.\nIt is important to have recommended medical checkups and tests (see Follow-up Care) to take care of your health.\nTalk with your health care team to develop a survivorship care plan that is best for your needs.\nLooking for More Survivorship Resources?\nFor more information about cancer survivorship, explore these related items. Please note that these links will take you to other sections of Cancer.Net:\n Get this 44-page booklet that helps people transition into life after treatment. It includes blank forms for treatment summaries and survivorship care plans. This free booklet is available as a PDF, so it is easy to print.\n View a short video led by an ASCO expert that provides information about what comes after finishing treatment.\n Cancer.Net offers an entire area of this website with resources to help survivors, including those in different age groups.\nThe next section offers \nQuestions to Ask the Health Care Team\n to help start conversations with your cancer care team.

They are in the pelvis, one on each side of the\n\t\t  uterus (the hollow, pear-shaped\n\t\t  organ where a fetus grows). Each\n\t\t  ovary is about the size and shape of an almond. The ovaries make eggs and\n\t\t  female hormones (chemicals that\n\t\t  control the way certain cells or\n\t\t  organs work). \nThe fallopian tubes are a pair of long, slender tubes, one on each side of the uterus. Eggs pass from the ovaries, through the fallopian tubes, to the uterus. Cancer sometimes begins at the end of the fallopian tube near the ovary and spreads to the ovary.\nThe  peritoneum is the tissue that lines the abdominal wall and covers organs in the abdomen. Primary peritoneal cancer is cancer that forms in the peritoneum and has not spread there from another part of the body. Cancer sometimes begins in the peritoneum and spreads to the ovary. \nOvarian epithelial cancer\n\t\t  is one type of cancer that affects the\n\t\t  ovary. See the following PDQ treatment summaries for information about other types of ovarian tumors:\nOvarian epithelial cancer, fallopian tube cancer, and primary peritoneal cancer form in the same type of tissue and are treated the same way.\n",

Talk to your doctor if you think you may be at risk for ovarian cancer.\nRisk factors for ovarian cancer include the following:\nFamily history of ovarian cancer in a first-degree relative (mother, daughter, or sister).\nInherited changes in the BRCA1\n or BRCA2\n genes.\nOther hereditary conditions, such as hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC; also called Lynch syndrome).\nEndometriosis.\nPostmenopausal hormone therapy.\nObesity.\nTall height.\nOlder age is the main risk factor for most cancers. The chance of getting cancer increases as you get older.\nSome ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal  cancers are caused by inherited gene mutations\n\t\t  (changes).\nThe genes in cells carry the hereditary information\n\t\t  that is received from a person’s parents. Hereditary ovarian cancer makes up about\n\t\t  20% of all cases of ovarian cancer. There are three hereditary patterns: ovarian cancer alone, ovarian and breast cancers, and ovarian and\n\t\t  colon cancers.\nFallopian tube cancer  and peritoneal cancer may also be caused by certain inherited gene mutations.\nThere are tests that can detect gene mutations. These\n\t\t  genetic tests are sometimes done for\n\t\t  members of families with a high risk of cancer. See the following PDQ summaries  for\n\t\t  more information: \nGenetics of Breast and Gynecologic Cancers (for health professionals)\nWomen with an increased risk of ovarian cancer may consider\n\t\t  surgery to lessen the risk.\nSome women who have an increased risk of ovarian\n\t\t  cancer may choose to have arisk-reducing\n\t\t  oophorectomy(the removal of healthy ovaries so that cancer\n\t\t  cannot grow in them). In high-risk women, this procedure has been shown to  greatly decrease the risk of ovarian cancer.

A history of the patient’s health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.\n: An exam of the vagina, cervix, uterus, fallopian tubes, ovaries, and rectum.    A speculum is inserted into the vagina and the doctor or nurse looks at the vagina and cervix for signs of disease.  A Pap test of the cervix is usually done.  The doctor or nurse also inserts one or two lubricated, gloved fingers of one hand into the vagina and places the other hand over the lower abdomen to feel the size, shape, and position of the uterus and ovaries. The doctor or nurse also inserts a lubricated, gloved finger into the rectum to feel for lumps or abnormal areas.\n: A test that measures the level of CA 125 in the blood.  CA 125 is a substance released by cells into the bloodstream.  An increased CA 125 level can be a sign of cancer or another condition such as endometriosis.\n: A procedure in which high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) are bounced off internal tissues or organs in the abdomen, and make echoes.  The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a sonogram. The picture can be printed to be looked at later.\n\nSome patients may have a transvaginal ultrasound.\n: A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles.  The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly.  This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography. \n: A procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body.  A very small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into a vein.  The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body.  Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do.\n: A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).\n: An x-ray of the organs and bones inside the chest.  An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body.\n: The removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope by a pathologist to check for signs of cancer. The tissue is usually removed during surgery to remove the tumor.\n"

The information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease. It is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment. The results of the tests used to diagnose cancer are often also used to stage the disease. (See the General Information section for tests and procedures used to diagnose and stage ovarian, fallopian tube, and peritoneal cancer.)\nThere are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.\nCancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood:\nTissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.\nLymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body.\nBlood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body.\nCancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.\nWhen cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called metastasis. Cancer cells break away from where they began (the primary tumor) and travel through the lymph system or blood.\nLymph system. The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.\nBlood. The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.\nThe metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. For example, if  ovarian epithelial cancer spreads to the lung, the cancer cells in the lung are actually ovarian epithelial cancer cells. The disease is metastatic ovarian epithelial cancer, not lung cancer.\nThe following stages are used for ovarian epithelial, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal\n\t\t  cancer:\nStage I\nIn stage I, cancer is\n\t\t\t found in one or both ovaries or fallopian tubes. Stage I is divided into stage IA, stage IB, and stage IC.\nStage IA: Cancer is found inside a single ovary or fallopian tube.\nStage IB: Cancer is found inside both ovaries or fallopian tubes.\nStage IC: Cancer is found inside one or both ovaries or fallopian tubes and one of\n\t\t\t\tthe following is true: \n\t\t\t\tcancer is also found on the outside surface of one or both\n\t\t\t\t\t ovaries or fallopian tubes; or\nthe capsule (outer covering) of the ovary\n\t\t\t\t\t ruptured (broke open) before or during surgery; or\ncancer cells\n\t\t\t\t\t are found in the fluid of  the peritoneal cavity (the body cavity that contains\n\t\t\t\t\t most of the organs in the abdomen) or in washings of the peritoneum (tissue lining the peritoneal\n\t\t\t\t\t cavity).\nStage II\nIn stage II, cancer is\n\t\t\t found in one or both ovaries or fallopian tubes and has spread into other areas of the\n\t\t\t pelvis, or primary peritoneal cancer is found within the pelvis. Stage II ovarian epithelial and fallopian tube cancers are divided\n\t\t\t into stage IIA and stage IIB.\nStage IIA: Cancer has spread from where it first formed to the\n\t\t\t\tuterus and/or the\n\t\t\t\tfallopian tubes and/or the ovaries.\nStage IIB: Cancer has spread from the ovary or fallopian tube to organs in  the peritoneal cavity (the space that contains the abdominal organs).\nStage III\nIn stage III, cancer\n\t\t\t is found in one or both ovaries or fallopian tubes, or is primary peritoneal cancer, and has spread outside the pelvis  to other parts of the abdomen and/or to nearby lymph nodes.\n\t\t\t  Stage III is divided into stage IIIA, stage IIIB, and stage IIIC.\nIn stage IIIA, one of the following is true:Cancer has spread to lymph nodes in the area outside or behind the peritoneum only;      or\nCancer cells that can be seen only with a microscope have spread to the  surface of the peritoneum outside the pelvis Cancer may have spread to nearby lymph nodes. \nStage IIIB: Cancer has spread to the peritoneum outside the pelvis and the cancer in the peritoneum is 2 centimeters or smaller. Cancer may have spread to lymph nodes behind the peritoneum.\nStage IIIC: Cancer has spread to the peritoneum outside the pelvis and the cancer in the peritoneum is\n\t\t\t\tlarger than 2 centimeters. Cancer may have spread to\n\t\t\t\tlymph nodes behind the peritoneum or to the surface of the liver or spleen.\nStage IV\nIn stage IV, cancer has  spread beyond the abdomen to other\n\t\t\t parts of the body. Stage IV is divided into stage IVA and stage IVB.\nStage IVA: Cancer cells are found in  extra fluid that builds up  around the lungs.\nStage IVB: Cancer has spread to organs and tissues outside the abdomen, including lymph nodes in the groin.\nOvarian epithelial, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancers are grouped for treatment as early or advanced cancer. \nStage I ovarian epithelial and fallopian tube cancers are treated as early cancers.\nStages II, III, and IV ovarian epithelial, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancers are treated as advanced cancers.\nOvarian epithelial, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancers can recur (come back) after treatment.\nThe cancer may come back in the same place or in other parts of the body. Persistent cancer is cancer that does not go away with treatment.\n"

Radiation therapy\nImmunotherapy\nTreatment for ovarian epithelial, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancer may cause side effects.\nPatients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.\nPatients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.\nFollow-up tests may be needed.\nThere are different types of treatment for patients with ovarian epithelial\n\t\t  cancer.\nDifferent types of treatment are available for patients with\n\t\t  ovarian epithelial cancer. Some\n\t\t  treatments are standard, and some are being tested in\n\t\t  clinical trials.  A\n\t\t  treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current\n\t\t  treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer.\n\t\t  When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the treatment\n\t\t  currently used as standard\n\t\t  treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment.\n\t\t  Patients with any stage of ovarian cancer may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.\nThree kinds of standard treatment are used.\nSurgery \nMost patients have surgery to remove as much of the\n\t\t\t tumor as possible. Different types\n\t\t\t of surgery may include:\n Hysterectomy: Surgery to remove the uterus and, sometimes, the cervix. When only the uterus is removed, it is called a partial hysterectomy. When both the uterus and the cervix are removed, it is called a total hysterectomy.   If the uterus and cervix are taken out through the vagina, the operation is called a vaginal hysterectomy.  If the uterus and cervix are taken out through a large incision (cut) in the abdomen, the operation is called a total abdominal hysterectomy.  If the uterus and cervix are taken out through a small incision (cut) in the abdomen using a laparoscope, the operation is called a total laparoscopic hysterectomy.\nUnilateral salpingo-oophorectomy: A surgical procedure to remove one ovary and one fallopian tube.\nBilateral salpingo-oophorectomy: A surgical procedure to remove both ovaries and both fallopian tubes.\nOmentectomy: A surgical procedure to remove the omentum (tissue in the peritoneum that contains blood vessels, nerves, lymph vessels, and lymph nodes). \nLymph node biopsy: The removal of all or part of a lymph node. A pathologist views the lymph node tissue under a microscope to check for cancer cells.\nChemotherapy\nChemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.  When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy).  When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). \nA type of regional chemotherapy used to treat ovarian cancer is  intraperitoneal (IP) chemotherapy. In IP chemotherapy, the anticancer drugs are carried directly into the peritoneal cavity (the space that contains the abdominal organs) through a thin tube.\nHyperthermic intraperitoneal  chemotherapy (HIPEC) is a treatment used during surgery that is being studied for ovarian cancer. After the surgeon has removed as much tumor tissue as possible,  warmed chemotherapy is sent directly into the peritoneal cavity.\nTreatment with more than one anticancer drug is called combination chemotherapy.\nThe  way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated.\nSee Drugs Approved for Ovarian, Fallopian Tube, or Primary Peritoneal Cancer for more information.\nTargeted therapy\nTargeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells. Targeted therapies usually cause less harm to normal cells than chemotherapy or radiation therapy do.\nMonoclonal antibodies are immune system proteins made in the laboratory to treat many diseases, including cancer. As a cancer treatment, these antibodies can attach to a specific target on cancer cells or other cells that may help cancer cells grow. The antibodies are able to then kill the cancer cells, block their growth, or keep them from spreading. Monoclonal antibodies are given by infusion. They may be used alone or to carry drugs, toxins, or radioactive material directly to cancer cells. Monoclonal antibodies may be used in combination with chemotherapy as adjuvant therapy.\nBevacizumab is a monoclonal antibody and angiogenesis inhibitor that may be used with chemotherapy to treat ovarian epithelial cancer, fallopian tube cancer, or primary peritoneal cancer that has recurred (come back). It binds to a protein calledvascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)and may prevent the growth of new blood vessels that tumors need to grow.  Other angiogenesis inhibitors are being studied in the treatment of advanced or recurrent ovarian cancer. \nPoly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARP inhibitors) are targeted therapy drugs that block DNA repair and may cause cancer cells to die. Olaparib, rucaparib, and niraparib are PARP inhibitors that may be  used to treat advanced ovarian cancer. Olaparib and rucaparib may  also be used as maintenance therapy to treat ovarian epithelial cancer, fallopian tube cancer, or primary peritoneal cancer that has recurred. Veliparib is a PARP inhibitor that is being studied to treat advanced ovarian cancer.\nSee Drugs Approved for Ovarian, Fallopian Tube, or Primary Peritoneal Cancer for more information.\nNew types of treatment are being tested in clinical\n\t\t  trials. \nThis summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials. It may not mention every new treatment being studied. Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website.\nRadiation therapy\nRadiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. Some women receive a treatment called\n\t\t\t intraperitoneal radiation therapy,\n\t\t\t in which radioactive liquid is put directly in the abdomen through a catheter. Intraperitoneal radiation therapy is being studied to treat advanced ovarian cancer.\nImmunotherapy\nImmunotherapy is a treatment that uses the patient’s immune system to fight cancer.  Substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost, direct, or restore the body’s natural defenses against cancer.  This cancer treatment is a type of biologic therapy.\nVaccine therapy is a cancer treatment that uses a substance or group of substances to stimulate the immune system to find the tumor and kill it. Vaccine therapy is being studied to treat advanced ovarian cancer.\nTreatment for ovarian epithelial, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancer may cause side effects.\nFor information about side effects caused by treatment for cancer, see our Side Effects page.\nPatients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.\nFor some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer  treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.\nMany of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first  to receive a new treatment.\nPatients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.\nPatients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.\nSome clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.\nClinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. Information about clinical trials supported by NCI can be found on NCI’s clinical trials search webpage. Clinical trials supported by other organizations can be found on the ClinicalTrials.gov website.\nFollow-up tests may be needed.\nSome of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated. Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.\nSome of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back). These tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups.\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n        Treatment of Early Ovarian Epithelial and Fallopian Tube Cancer\n\n        For information about the treatments listed below, see the Treatment Option Overview section.\nTreatment of early ovarian epithelial\n\t\t  cancer or fallopian tube cancer may include the following:\n  Hysterectomy,\n\t\t\t bilateral\n\t\t\t salpingo-oophorectomy, and\n\t\t\t omentectomy.\n\t\t\t Lymph nodes and other\n\t\t\t tissues in the\n\t\t\t pelvis and\n\t\t\t abdomen are removed and checked\n\t\t\t under a microscope for cancer cells.

The PDQ database contains summaries of the latest published information on cancer prevention, detection, genetics, treatment, supportive care, and complementary and alternative medicine. Most summaries come in two versions. The health professional versions have detailed information written in technical language. The patient versions are written in easy-to-understand, nontechnical language. Both versions have cancer information that is accurate and up to date and most versions are also available in Spanish.\nPDQ is a service of the NCI. The NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). NIH is the federal government’s center of biomedical research.  The PDQ summaries are based on an independent review of the medical literature. They are not policy statements of the NCI or the NIH.\nPurpose of This Summary\nThis PDQ cancer information summary has current information about the treatment of ovarian epithelial, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancer.  It is meant to inform and help patients, families, and caregivers. It does not give formal guidelines or recommendations for making decisions about health care.\nReviewers and Updates\nEditorial Boards write the PDQ cancer information summaries and keep them up to date. These Boards are made up of experts in cancer treatment and other specialties related to cancer. The summaries are reviewed regularly and changes are made when there is new information. The date on each summary (\"Updated\") is the date of the most recent change.\nThe information in this patient summary was taken from the health professional version, which is reviewed regularly and updated as needed, by the PDQ Adult Treatment Editorial Board.\nClinical Trial Information\nA clinical trial is a study to answer a scientific question, such as whether one treatment is better than another. Trials are based on past studies and what has been learned in the laboratory. Each trial answers certain scientific questions in order to find new and better ways to help cancer patients. During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works. If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become \"standard.\" Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.\nClinical trials can be found online at NCI's website. For more information, call the Cancer Information Service (CIS), NCI's contact center, at 1-800-4-CANCER (1-800-422-6237).\nPermission to Use This Summary\nPDQ is a registered trademark.

Ovarian germ\n\t\t  cell tumors usually occur in teenage girls or young women and most often affect\n\t\t  just one ovary. \nThe ovaries are a pair of organs in the female\n\t\t  reproductive system. They are\n\t\t  in the pelvis, one on each\n\t\t  side of the uterus (the hollow,\n\t\t  pear-shaped organ where a fetus\n\t\t  grows). Each ovary is about the size and shape of an almond. The ovaries\n\t\t  make eggs and female hormones. \nOvarian germ cell tumor is a general name that is used to describe\n\t\t  several different types of cancer. The\n\t\t  most common ovarian germ cell tumor is called dysgerminoma. See the following PDQ\n\t\t  summaries for information\n\t\t  about other types of ovarian tumors: \nOvarian\n\t\t  Low Malignant Potential Tumors Treatment",

A history of the patient’s health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.\n: An exam of the vagina, cervix, uterus, fallopian tubes, ovaries, and rectum.     A speculum is inserted into the vagina and the doctor or nurse looks at the vagina and cervix for signs of disease.  A Pap test of the cervix is usually done.  The doctor or nurse also inserts one or two lubricated, gloved fingers of one hand into the vagina and places the other hand over the lower abdomen to feel the size, shape, and position of the uterus and ovaries. The doctor or nurse also inserts a lubricated, gloved finger into the rectum to feel for lumps or abnormal areas.\n: A surgical procedure in which an incision (cut) is made in the wall of the abdomen to check the inside of the abdomen for signs of disease. The size of the incision depends on the reason the laparotomy is being done. Sometimes organs are removed or tissue samples are taken and checked under a microscope for signs of disease.\n:\n\t\t  A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles.  The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly.  This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.\n: A procedure in which a sample of blood is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs, tissues, or tumor cells in the body. Certain substances are linked to specific types of cancer when found in increased levels in the blood. These are called tumor markers. An increased level ofalpha fetoprotein (AFP)orhuman chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) in the blood may be a sign of ovarian germ cell tumor.\n"

        "text": "Certain factors affect prognosis\n\t\t  (chance of recovery) and treatment options.\nThe prognosis and treatment options depend on\n\t\t  the following:\nThe type\n\t\t  of cancer.\n The size of the tumor.\nThe stage of cancer (whether it affects part\n\t\t  of the ovary, involves the whole ovary, or has spread to other places in the\n\t\t  body).\nThe way the cancer cells look under a microscope.\nThe patient’s\n\t\t  general health. \nOvarian germ cell tumors are usually cured if found and\n\t\t  treated early. \n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n        Stages of Ovarian Germ Cell Tumors\n\n        Key Points\nAfter ovarian germ cell tumor has been diagnosed, tests\n\t\t  are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the ovary or to other\n\t\t  parts of the body.\nThere are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.\nCancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.\nThe following stages are used for ovarian germ cell\n\t\t  tumors:Stage I\nStage II\nStage III\nStage IV\nOvarian germ cell tumor can recur (come back) after it as been treated.\nAfter ovarian germ cell tumor has been diagnosed, tests\n\t\t  are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the ovary or to other\n\t\t  parts of the body.\nThe process used to find out whether cancer has spread within the\n\t\t  ovary or to other parts of the body\n\t\t  is called staging. The information gathered from the\n\t\t  staging process determines the stage of the disease. Unless a doctor is sure the cancer has spread from the ovaries to other parts\n\t\t  of the body, an\n\t\t  operation called a laparotomy is done to see if  the cancer has spread. The\n\t\t  doctor must cut into the abdomen and\n\t\t  carefully look at all the organs to see if they have cancer in them. The doctor will\n\t\t  cut out small pieces of tissue so they can be checked  under a microscope  for signs of cancer. The doctor may also wash the\n\t\t  abdominal cavity with fluid, which is also checked  under a microscope to see if it has cancer cells in it.\n\t\t  Usually the doctor will remove the cancer and other organs that have cancer in them\n\t\t  during the laparotomy. It is important\n\t\t  to know the stage  in\n\t\t  order to plan treatment. \n\t\t  \nMany of the tests used to diagnose ovarian germ cell tumor are also used for staging.\n\t\t  The following tests and procedures may also be used for staging:\n\n: A procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body.  A small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into a vein.  The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body.  Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do.\n: A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).\n: A procedure used to examine the vagina, uterus, fallopian tubes, and bladder. An ultrasound transducer (probe) is inserted into the vagina and used to bounce high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) off internal tissues or organs and make echoes. The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a sonogram. The doctor can identify tumors by looking at the sonogram.\nThere are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.\nCancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood:\nTissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.\nLymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body.\nBlood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body.\nCancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.\nWhen cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called metastasis. Cancer cells break away from where they began (the primary tumor) and travel through the lymph system or blood.\nLymph system. The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.\nBlood. The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.\nThe metastatic tumor is the same type of tumor as the primary tumor. For example, if  an ovarian germ cell tumor spreads to the liver, the tumor cells in the liver are actually cancerous ovarian germ cells. The disease is metastatic ovarian germ cell tumor, not liver cancer.\nThe following stages are used for ovarian germ cell\n\t\t  tumors:\nStage I\nIn stage I, cancer is found in one or both ovaries or fallopian tubes. Stage I is divided into stage IA, stage\n\t\t\t IB, and stage IC.\nStage IA: Cancer is found inside a single ovary or fallopian tube.\nStage IB: Cancer is found inside both ovaries or fallopian tubes.\nStage IC: Cancer is found inside  one or both ovaries or fallopian tubes and one of the following is true: cancer is also found on  the outside surface of one\n\t\t\t\tor both ovaries or fallopian tubes; or\nthe capsule (outer covering) of the ovary  ruptured (broke open) before or during surgery; or\ncancer cells are found in the fluid of the peritoneal cavity (the body cavity that contains\n\t\t\t\t\t most of the organs in the abdomen) or  in washings of the peritoneum (tissue lining the peritoneal\n\t\t\t\t\t cavity). \n  \nStage II\n In stage II, cancer is found in one or both ovaries or fallopian tubes and has spread into other areas of the pelvis, or primary peritoneal cancer is found within the pelvis.  Stage II is divided into\n\t\t\t stage IIA and stage IIB. \nStage IIA: Cancer has spread from where it first formed to the\n\t\t\t\tuterus and/or \n\t\t\t\tthe fallopian tubes and/or the ovaries.\nStage IIB: Cancer has spread from the ovary or fallopian tube to organs in  the peritoneal cavity (the space that contains the abdominal organs). \nStage III\n  In stage III, cancer\n\t\t\t is found in one or both ovaries or fallopian tubes, or is primary peritoneal cancer, and has spread outside the pelvis to other parts of the abdomen and/or to nearby lymph nodes.\n\t\t\t  Stage III is divided into stage IIIA, stage\n\t\t\t IIIB, and stage IIIC. \nIn stage IIIA, one of the following is true:Cancer has spread to lymph nodes in the area outside or behind the peritoneum only;      or\nCancer cells that can be seen only with a microscope have spread to the surface of the peritoneum outside the pelvis. Cancer may have spread to nearby lymph nodes. \nStage IIIB: Cancer has spread to the peritoneum outside the pelvis and the cancer in the peritoneum is 2 centimeters or smaller. Cancer may have spread to lymph nodes behind the peritoneum.\nStage IIIC: Cancer has spread to the peritoneum outside the pelvis and the cancer in the peritoneum is\n\t\t\t\tlarger than 2 centimeters. Cancer may have spread to lymph nodes behind the peritoneum or to the surface of the liver or spleen.\nStage IV\nIn stage IV, cancer has spread beyond the abdomen to other parts of the body. Stage IV is divided into stage IVA and stage IVB.\nStage IVA: Cancer cells are found in  extra fluid that builds up  around the lungs.\nStage IVB: Cancer has spread to organs and tissues outside the abdomen, including lymph nodes in the groin.\nOvarian germ cell tumor can recur (come back) after it as been treated.\nThe cancer may come back in the other\n\t\tovary or in other parts of the body.\n"

        "text": "Treatment Option Overview\n\n        Key Points\nThere are different types of treatment for patients with ovarian germ cell\n\t\t  tumors. \nFour types of standard treatment are used: Surgery\nObservation\nChemotherapy \nRadiation therapy \nNew types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.High-dose chemotherapy with bone marrow\n\t\t\t transplant\nNew treatment options \nTreatment for ovarian germ cell tumors may cause side effects.\nPatients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.\nPatients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.\nFollow-up tests may be needed.\nThere are different types of treatment for patients with ovarian germ cell\n\t\t  tumors. \nDifferent types of treatment are available for patients with ovarian germ cell tumor. Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some\n\t\t  are being tested in clinical trials.\n\t\t   A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help\n\t\t  improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients\n\t\t  with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the\n\t\t  standard treatment, the new\n\t\t  treatment may become the standard treatment.   Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.\nFour types of standard treatment are used: \nSurgery\nSurgery is the most common\n\t\t\t treatment of ovarian germ cell tumor. A doctor may take out the\n\t\t\t cancer using one of the following\n\t\t\t types of surgery. \nUnilateral salpingo-oophorectomy: A surgical procedure to remove one ovary and one fallopian tube. \nTotal hysterectomy: A surgical procedure to remove the uterus, including the cervix.  If the uterus and cervix are taken out through the vagina, the operation is called a vaginal hysterectomy.  If the uterus and cervix are taken out through a large incision (cut) in the abdomen, the operation is called a total abdominal hysterectomy.  If the uterus and cervix are taken out through a small incision (cut) in the abdomen using a laparoscope, the operation is called a total laparoscopic hysterectomy.\nBilateral salpingo-oophorectomy: A surgical procedure to remove both ovaries and both fallopian tubes.\nTumor debulking:\n\t\t\t\tA surgical procedure in which as much of the tumor as possible is removed.  Some tumors cannot be completely removed.\nAfter the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the\n\t\t  time of the surgery, some patients may be given chemotherapy or radiation therapy\n\t\t  after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left. Treatment given after the\n\t\t  surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called adjuvant therapy.\nAfter chemotherapy for an ovarian germ cell tumor, a second-look laparotomy may be done. This is similar to the laparotomy that is done to find out the stage of the cancer. Second-look laparotomy is a surgical procedure to find out if tumor cells are left after primary treatment. During this procedure, the doctor will take samples of lymph nodes and other tissues in the abdomen to see if any cancer is left. This procedure is not done for dysgerminomas.\nObservation\nObservation is closely watching a patient’s condition without giving any treatment unless signs or symptoms appear or change. \nChemotherapy \nChemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.  When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy).  When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). Combination chemotherapy is treatment using more than one anticancer drug. The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated.\nSee Drugs Approved for Ovarian, Fallopian Tube, or Primary Peritoneal Cancer for more information.\nRadiation therapy \nRadiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing.  External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the area of the body with cancer. \nNew types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.\nThis summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials. It may not mention every new treatment being studied. Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website.\nHigh-dose chemotherapy with bone marrow\n\t\t\t transplant\nHigh-dose chemotherapy with bone marrow\n\t\t\t transplant is a method of giving very high doses of chemotherapy and replacing blood-forming cells destroyed by the cancer treatment.  Stem cells (immature blood cells) are removed from the bone marrow of the patient or a donor and are frozen and stored.  After the chemotherapy is completed, the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an infusion.  These reinfused stem cells grow into (and restore) the body’s blood cells.\nNew treatment options \nCombination\n\t\t\t chemotherapy (the use of more than one anticancer drug) is being tested in clinical trials. \nTreatment for ovarian germ cell tumors may cause side effects.\nFor information about side effects caused by treatment for cancer, see our Side Effects page.\nPatients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.\nFor some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer  treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.\nMany of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first  to receive a new treatment.\nPatients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.\nPatients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.\nSome clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.\nClinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. Information about clinical trials supported by NCI can be found on NCI’s clinical trials search webpage. Clinical trials supported by other organizations can be found on the ClinicalTrials.gov website.\nFollow-up tests may be needed.\nSome of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated. Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.\nSome of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back). These tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups.\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n        Treatment of Stage I Ovarian Germ Cell Tumors\n\n        For information about the treatments listed below, see the Treatment Option Overview section.\nTreatment depends on whether the tumor is a dysgerminoma or another type of\n\t\t  ovarian germ cell tumor.\n Treatment of dysgerminoma may include the following: \nUnilateral salpingo-oophorectomy  with or\n\t\t\t without lymphangiography or\n\t\t\t CT scan. \nUnilateral salpingo-oophorectomy followed by\n\t\t\t observation.\n\t\t\t \nUnilateral salpingo-oophorectomy followed by\n\t\t\t radiation therapy.\nUnilateral salpingo-oophorectomy followed by\n\t\t\t chemotherapy.\nTreatment of other ovarian germ cell tumors may be either: \nunilateral salpingo-oophorectomy followed by careful\n\t\t\t observation; or\nunilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, sometimes followed by\n\t\t\t combination chemotherapy.\nUse our clinical trial search to find NCI-supported cancer clinical trials that are accepting patients.

The PDQ database contains summaries of the latest published information on cancer prevention, detection, genetics, treatment, supportive care, and complementary and alternative medicine. Most summaries come in two versions. The health professional versions have detailed information written in technical language. The patient versions are written in easy-to-understand, nontechnical language. Both versions have cancer information that is accurate and up to date and most versions are also available in Spanish.\nPDQ is a service of the NCI. The NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). NIH is the federal government’s center of biomedical research.  The PDQ summaries are based on an independent review of the medical literature. They are not policy statements of the NCI or the NIH.\nPurpose of This Summary\nThis PDQ cancer information summary has current information about the treatment of ovarian germ cell tumors.  It is meant to inform and help patients, families, and caregivers. It does not give formal guidelines or recommendations for making decisions about health care.\nReviewers and Updates\nEditorial Boards write the PDQ cancer information summaries and keep them up to date. These Boards are made up of experts in cancer treatment and other specialties related to cancer. The summaries are reviewed regularly and changes are made when there is new information. The date on each summary (\"Updated\") is the date of the most recent change.\nThe information in this patient summary was taken from the health professional version, which is reviewed regularly and updated as needed, by the PDQ Adult Treatment Editorial Board.\nClinical Trial Information\nA clinical trial is a study to answer a scientific question, such as whether one treatment is better than another. Trials are based on past studies and what has been learned in the laboratory. Each trial answers certain scientific questions in order to find new and better ways to help cancer patients. During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works. If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become \"standard.\" Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.\nClinical trials can be found online at NCI's website.

This disease usually remains in the\n\t\t  ovary. When disease is found in one\n\t\t  ovary, the other ovary  should also be checked carefully for signs of\n\t\t  disease.\n The ovaries are a pair of organs in the female\n\t\t  reproductive system. They are\n\t\t  in the pelvis, one on each\n\t\t  side of the uterus (the hollow,\n\t\t  pear-shaped organ where a fetus\n\t\t  grows). Each ovary is about the size and shape of an almond. The ovaries\n\t\t  make eggs and female hormones. \n",

A history of the patient’s health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.\n: An exam of the vagina, cervix, uterus, fallopian tubes, ovaries, and rectum.    A speculum is inserted into the vagina and the doctor or nurse looks at the vagina and cervix for signs of disease.  A Pap test of the cervix is usually done.  The doctor or nurse also inserts one or two lubricated, gloved fingers of one hand into the vagina and places the other hand over the lower abdomen to feel the size, shape, and position of the uterus and ovaries. The doctor or nurse also inserts a lubricated, gloved finger into the rectum to feel for lumps or abnormal areas.\n: A procedure in which high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) are bounced off internal tissues or organs and make echoes.  The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a sonogram. The picture can be printed to be looked at later.Other patients may have a transvaginal ultrasound. \n\n: A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles.  The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly.  This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.\n\n: A test that measures the level of CA 125 in the blood. CA 125 is a substance released by cells into the bloodstream. An increased CA 125 level is sometimes a sign of cancer or other condition.\n: An x-ray of the organs and bones inside the chest.  An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body.\n: The removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope by a pathologist to check for signs of cancer. The tissue is usually removed during surgery to remove the tumor.\n"

The information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease. It is important to know the\n\t\t  stage  in order to\n\t\t  plan treatment. Certain tests or procedures are used for staging. Staging laparotomy (a surgical\n\t\t  incision made in the wall of the\n\t\t  abdomen to remove ovarian tissue)\n\t\t  may be used. Most patients are diagnosed with stage\n\t\t  I disease. \nThe following stages are used for ovarian low malignant potential tumor:\nStage I\nIn stage I, the tumor is found in one or both ovaries or fallopian tubes. Stage I is divided into stage IA, stage IB, and stage IC.\n\nStage IA: The tumor is found inside a single ovary or fallopian tube. \nStage IB: The tumor is found inside both ovaries or fallopian tubes. \nStage IC: The tumor is found inside one or both ovaries or fallopian tubes and one of the following is true: \ntumor cells are found on the outside surface of one or both ovaries or fallopian tubes; or \nthe capsule (outer covering) of the ovary ruptured (broke open) before or during  surgery; or \ntumor cells are found in the fluid of the peritoneal cavity (the body cavity that contains most of the organs in the abdomen) or in washings of the peritoneum (tissue lining the peritoneal cavity). \nStage II\nIn stage II, the tumor is found in one or both ovaries or fallopian tubes and has spread into other areas of the pelvis, or primary peritoneal cancer is found within the pelvis. Stage II is divided into stage IIA and stage IIB.\nStage IIA: The tumor has spread from where it first formed to the uterus and/or the fallopian tubes and/or the ovaries. \nStage IIB: The tumor has spread from the ovary or fallopian tube to organs in  the peritoneal cavity (the space that contains the abdominal organs). \nStage III \nIn stage III, the tumor is found in one or both ovaries or fallopian tubes, or is primary peritoneal cancer, and has spread outside the pelvis  to other parts of the abdomen and/or to nearby lymph nodes.\n\t\t\t  Stage III is divided into stage IIIA, stage IIIB, and stage IIIC.\nIn stage IIIA, one of the following is true:The tumor has spread to lymph nodes in the area outside or behind the peritoneum only;      or\n Tumor cells that can be seen only with a microscope have spread to the surface of the peritoneum outside the pelvis. The tumor may have spread to nearby lymph nodes. \n \nStage IIIB: The tumor has spread to the peritoneum outside the pelvis and the tumor  in the peritoneum is 2 centimeters or smaller. \nThe tumor may have spread to lymph nodes behind the peritoneum.\nStage IIIC: The tumor has spread to the peritoneum outside the pelvis and the tumor in the peritoneum is\n\t\t\t\tlarger than 2 centimeters. The tumor may have spread to lymph nodes behind the peritoneum or to the surface of the liver or spleen.\nStage IV\n  \n\nIn stage IV, tumor  cells have spread beyond the abdomen to other parts of the body.

Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some\n\t\t  are being tested in clinical trials.\n\t\t   A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help\n\t\t  improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients\n\t\t  with cancer, tumors, and related conditions. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the\n\t\t  standard treatment, the new\n\t\t  treatment may become the standard treatment. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.\nTwo types of standard treatment are used: \nSurgery\nThe type of surgery (removing the\n\t\t\t tumor in an operation) depends on\n\t\t\t the size and spread of the tumor and the woman’s plans for having children. Surgery\n\t\t\t may include the following:\nUnilateral\n\t\t\t\tsalpingo-oophorectomy: Surgery to remove one ovary and one fallopian tube.\nBilateral salpingo-oophorectomy: Surgery to remove both ovaries and both fallopian tubes.\nTotal hysterectomy and\n\t\t\t\tbilateral salpingo-oophorectomy: Surgery to remove the uterus, cervix, and both ovaries and fallopian tubes.  If the uterus and cervix are taken out through the vagina, the operation is called a vaginal hysterectomy.  If the uterus and cervix are taken out through a large incision (cut) in the abdomen, the operation is called a total abdominal hysterectomy.  If the uterus and cervix are taken out through a small incision (cut) in the abdomen using a laparoscope, the operation is called a total laparoscopic hysterectomy.\n Partial oophorectomy: Surgery to remove part of one ovary or part of both ovaries.\nOmentectomy:\n\t\t\t\tSurgery to remove the omentum (a piece of the tissue lining the abdominal wall).\nAfter the doctor removes all disease that can be seen at the\n\t\t\t time of the surgery, the patient may be given chemotherapy after surgery to kill any tumor\n\t\t\t cells that are left. Treatment given\n\t\t\t after the surgery, to lower the risk that the tumor will come back, is called\n\t\t\t adjuvant therapy. \nChemotherapy\nChemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.  When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy).  When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated.\nNew types of treatment are being tested in clinical\n\t\t  trials.\n Information about clinical trials is available from the\n\t\t  NCI website.\nTreatment for ovarian low malignant potential tumors may cause side effects.\nFor information about side effects caused by treatment for cancer, see our Side Effects page.\nPatients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.\nFor some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the medical research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.\nMany of today's standard treatments for disease are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.\nPatients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way diseases will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.\nPatients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their treatment.\nSome clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose disease has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop a disease from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of treatment.\nClinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. Information about clinical trials supported by NCI can be found on NCI’s clinical trials search webpage. Clinical trials supported by other organizations can be found on the ClinicalTrials.gov website.\nFollow-up tests may be needed.\nSome of the tests that were done to diagnose the disease may be repeated. Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests. This is sometimes called re-staging.\nSome of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the disease has recurred (come back). These tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups.\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n        Treatment of Early Stage Ovarian Low Malignant Potential Tumors (Stage I and II)\n\n        For information about the treatments listed below, see the Treatment Option Overview section.\nSurgery is the\n\t\t  standard treatment for early\n\t\t  stage ovarian low\n\t\t  malignant potential\n\t\t  tumor. The type of surgery usually depends on\n\t\t  whether a woman plans to have children.\nFor women who plan to have children, surgery is either:\nunilateral salpingo-oophorectomy; or\n\t\t\t \npartial oophorectomy.\nTo prevent recurrence of\n\t\t  disease, most doctors recommend surgery to remove the remaining ovarian tissue\n\t\t  when a woman no longer plans to have children.\nFor women who do not plan to have children, treatment may\n\t\t  be hysterectomy and\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy.\nUse our clinical trial search to find NCI-supported cancer clinical trials that are accepting patients.

The PDQ database contains summaries of the latest published information on cancer prevention, detection, genetics, treatment, supportive care, and complementary and alternative medicine. Most summaries come in two versions. The health professional versions have detailed information written in technical language. The patient versions are written in easy-to-understand, nontechnical language. Both versions have cancer information that is accurate and up to date and most versions are also available in Spanish.\nPDQ is a service of the NCI. The NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). NIH is the federal government’s center of biomedical research.  The PDQ summaries are based on an independent review of the medical literature. They are not policy statements of the NCI or the NIH.\nPurpose of This Summary\nThis PDQ cancer information summary has current information about the treatment of ovarian low-malignant potential tumors.  It is meant to inform and help patients, families, and caregivers. It does not give formal guidelines or recommendations for making decisions about health care.\nReviewers and Updates\nEditorial Boards write the PDQ cancer information summaries and keep them up to date. These Boards are made up of experts in cancer treatment and other specialties related to cancer. The summaries are reviewed regularly and changes are made when there is new information. The date on each summary (\"Updated\") is the date of the most recent change.\nThe information in this patient summary was taken from the health professional version, which is reviewed regularly and updated as needed, by the PDQ Adult Treatment Editorial Board.\nClinical Trial Information\nA clinical trial is a study to answer a scientific question, such as whether one treatment is better than another. Trials are based on past studies and what has been learned in the laboratory. Each trial answers certain scientific questions in order to find new and better ways to help cancer patients. During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works.

They are located in the pelvis, one on each side of the uterus (the hollow, pear-shaped organ where a fetus grows). Each ovary is about the size and shape of an almond in an adult woman. The ovaries produce eggs and female hormones (chemicals that control the way certain cells or organs function).\n\nMost ovarian tumors in children are benign (not cancer). They occur most often in females aged 15 to 19 years.\nThere are several types of malignant ovarian tumors.\nThe types of malignant ovarian tumors include the following:\n Tumors that start in egg cells in females. These are the most common ovarian tumors in girls. (See the PDQ summary on Childhood Extracranial Germ Cell Tumors Treatment for more information on ovarian germ cell  tumors.)\n Tumors that start in the tissue covering the ovary. These are the second most common ovarian tumors in girls. \nOvarian epithelial cancer is usually found at an early stage in children and is easier to treat than in adult patients.\n Tumors that begin in stromal cells, which make up  tissues that surround and support the ovaries. Juvenile granulosa cell tumors and Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors are two types of stromal tumors.\n Cancer that begins in the ovary and may have spread to the abdomen, pelvis, or other parts of the body. This type of ovarian cancer is fast growing and has a poor prognosis. \nThis summary is about ovarian non-germ cell tumors (epithelial tumors, stromal tumors, and small cell carcinoma of the ovary).\n",

A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the  standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment.\nBecause cancer in children is rare, taking part in a clinical trial should be considered.  Some clinical trials are open only to patients  who have not started treatment.\nChildren and adolescents with ovarian cancer should have their treatment planned by a team of doctors who are experts in treating childhood cancer.\nTreatment will be overseen by a pediatric oncologist, a doctor who specializes in treating children with cancer. The pediatric oncologist works with other pediatric health professionals who are experts in treating children with cancer and who specialize in certain areas of medicine. This may include the following specialists and others:\nPediatrician.\nPediatric surgeon.\nGynecologist.\nPediatric nurse specialist.\nRehabilitation specialist.\nSocial worker.\nPsychologist.\nFive types of standard treatment are used for ovarian cancer.\nSurgery\nSurgery is used to remove the cancer in the ovary. Surgery may also be used to remove the cancer and the  ovary or the cancer and the ovary and  fallopian tube.\nRadiation therapy\nRadiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the area of the body with cancer.\nChemotherapy\nChemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.     When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can affect cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy).\nHigh-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell rescue\nHigh doses of chemotherapy are given to kill cancer cells. Healthy cells, including blood-forming cells, are also destroyed by the cancer treatment. Stem cell rescue is a treatment to replace the blood-forming cells. Stem cells (immature blood cells) are removed from the blood or bone marrow of the patient and are frozen and stored. After the patient completes chemotherapy, the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an infusion. These reinfused stem cells grow into (and restore) the body's blood cells.\nTargeted therapy\nTargeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack cancer cells. Targeted therapies usually cause less harm to normal cells than chemotherapy and radiation therapy do.\nHistone methyltransferase inhibitors: This type of targeted therapy slows down the cancer cell's ability to grow and divide. Tazemetostat is used to treat ovarian cancer.\nTargeted therapy is also being studied for the treatment of childhood ovarian cancer that has recurred (come back).\nTreatment for childhood ovarian cancer may cause side effects.\nFor information about side effects that begin during treatment for cancer, see our Side Effects page.\nSide effects from cancer treatment that begin after treatment and continue for months or years are called late effects. Physical problems, such as problems with fertility, are a late effect of treatment.\nSome late effects may be treated or controlled. It is important to talk with your child's doctors about the possible late effects caused by some treatments.  See the PDQ summary on Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer for more information.\nPatients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.\nFor some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer  treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.\nMany of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first  to receive a new treatment.\nPatients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.\nPatients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.\nSome clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.\nClinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. Information about clinical trials supported by NCI can be found on NCI’s clinical trials search webpage. Clinical trials supported by other organizations can be found on the ClinicalTrials.gov website.\nFollow-up tests may be needed.\nSome of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated. Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.\nSome of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your child's condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back). These tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups.\n",

The PDQ database contains summaries of the latest published information on cancer prevention, detection, genetics, treatment, supportive care, and complementary and alternative medicine. Most summaries come in two versions. The health professional versions have detailed information written in technical language. The patient versions are written in easy-to-understand, nontechnical language. Both versions have cancer information that is accurate and up to date and most versions are also available in Spanish.\nPDQ is a service of the NCI. The NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). NIH is the federal government’s center of biomedical research.  The PDQ summaries are based on an independent review of the medical literature. They are not policy statements of the NCI or the NIH.\nPurpose of This Summary\nThis PDQ cancer information summary has current information about the treatment of childhood ovarian cancer.  It is meant to inform and help patients, families, and caregivers. It does not give formal guidelines or recommendations for making decisions about health care.\nReviewers and Updates\nEditorial Boards write the PDQ cancer information summaries and keep them up to date. These Boards are made up of experts in cancer treatment and other specialties related to cancer. The summaries are reviewed regularly and changes are made when there is new information. The date on each summary (\"Updated\") is the date of the most recent change.\nThe information in this patient summary was taken from the health professional version, which is reviewed regularly and updated as needed, by the PDQ Pediatric Treatment Editorial Board.\nClinical Trial Information\nA clinical trial is a study to answer a scientific question, such as whether one treatment is better than another. Trials are based on past studies and what has been learned in the laboratory. Each trial answers certain scientific questions in order to find new and better ways to help cancer patients. During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works. If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become \"standard.\" Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.\nClinical trials can be found online at NCI's website. For more information, call the Cancer Information Service (CIS), NCI's contact center, at 1-800-4-CANCER (1-800-422-6237).\nPermission to Use This Summary\nPDQ is a registered trademark.

By preventing cancer, the number of new cases of cancer \n         in a group or population is lowered. Hopefully, this will lower \n         the number of deaths caused by cancer.\nTo prevent new cancers from starting, scientists look at risk \n         factors and protective factors. Anything that increases your \n         chance of developing cancer is called a cancer risk factor; \n         anything that decreases your chance of developing cancer is \n         called a cancer protective factor.\nSome risk factors for cancer can be avoided, but many cannot. \n         For example, both smoking and inheriting certain genes are \n         risk factors for some types of cancer, but only smoking can be \n         avoided. Regular exercise and a healthy diet may be protective \n         factors for some types of cancer. Avoiding risk factors and \n         increasing protective factors may lower your risk but it does \n         not mean that you will not get cancer.\nDifferent ways to prevent cancer are being studied, including:\nChanging lifestyle or eating habits.\nAvoiding things known to cause cancer.\nTaking medicines to treat a precancerous condition or to \n         keep cancer from starting.\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n        General Information About Ovarian, Fallopian Tube, and Primary Peritoneal Cancer\n\n        Key Points\nOvarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancers are diseases in which malignant (cancer) cells\n\t\t  form in the  ovaries, fallopian tubes, or peritoneum.\nOvarian cancer is the leading cause of death from cancer of the\n\t\t  female reproductive system. \nOvarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancers are diseases in which malignant (cancer) cells\n\t\t  form in the  ovaries, fallopian tubes, or peritoneum.\nThe ovaries are a pair\n\t\t  of organs in the female reproductive\n\t\t  system. They are in the pelvis, one on each side of the\n\t\t  uterus (the hollow, pear-shaped\n\t\t  organ where a fetus grows). Each\n\t\t  ovary is about the size and shape of an almond. The ovaries  make eggs and\n\t\t  female hormones (chemicals that\n\t\t  control the way certain cells or\n\t\t  organs  work in the body).\nThe fallopian tubes are a pair of long, slender tubes, one on each side of the uterus. Eggs pass from the ovaries, through the fallopian tubes, to the uterus. Cancer sometimes begins at the end of the fallopian tube near the ovary and spreads to the ovary.\nThe  peritoneum is the tissue that lines the abdominal wall and covers organs in the abdomen. Primary peritoneal cancer is cancer that forms in the peritoneum and has not spread there from another part of the body. Cancer sometimes begins in the peritoneum and spreads to the ovary. \nOvarian cancer is the leading cause of death from cancer of the\n\t\t  female reproductive system. \n  Ovarian cancer is most common in postmenopausal women. From the mid-1980s to 2017, the number  of new cases of ovarian cancer decreased slightly each year. There was also a slight decrease in the number  of deaths from ovarian cancer each year from 2009 to 2018.\nWomen who have a family history of ovarian cancer and/or certaininherited gene changes, such as BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene changes, have a higher risk than women who do not have a family history or who have not inherited these gene changes. For  women with inherited risk, genetic counseling and genetic testing can be  used to find out more about how likely they are to develop  ovarian cancer.\nIt is hard to find ovarian cancer early. Early ovarian cancer may not cause any symptoms. When symptoms do appear, ovarian cancer is often advanced.\nSee the following PDQ summaries for more information about ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancers:\nGenetics of Breast and Gynecologic Cancers (written for health professionals)\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n        Ovarian, Fallopian Tube, and Primary Peritoneal Cancer Prevention\n\n        Key Points\nAvoiding risk factors and increasing protective factors may\n\t\t  help prevent cancer.\nThe following are risk\n factors for ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancer:Family history of ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancer\nInherited risk\nHormone replacement therapy\n Weight and height\nEndometriosis\nThe following are protective\n factors  for ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancer:Oral contraceptives\nTubal ligation\nGiving birth\nSalpingectomy\nBreastfeeding\nRisk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy\nIt is not clear whether the  following  affect the risk of ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancer:Diet\nAlcohol\nAspirin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs\nTalc\nInfertility treatment\nCancer prevention clinical trials are used to study ways \n    to prevent cancer.\n\n      \n     New ways to prevent ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancer are being studied in clinical \n     trials. \nAvoiding risk factors and increasing protective factors may\n\t\t  help prevent cancer.\nAvoiding cancer risk factors may help prevent certain cancers. Risk factors include smoking, being overweight, and not getting enough exercise.  Increasing protective factors such as quitting smoking and exercising may also help prevent some cancers. Talk to your doctor or other health care professional about how you might lower your risk of cancer.\nThe following are risk\n factors for ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancer:\nFamily history of ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancer\nA woman whose mother or sister  had ovarian cancer has an increased risk of ovarian cancer. A woman with two or  more relatives with ovarian cancer also has an increased risk of ovarian cancer. \n\nInherited risk\nThe risk of ovarian cancer is increased in women who have inherited certain changes in the BRCA1, BRCA2, or other genes.\nThe risk of ovarian cancer is also increased in women who have certain inherited syndromes that include:\n\tFamilial site-specific ovarian cancer syndrome.\n\tFamilial breast/ovarian cancer syndrome.\nHereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC; Lynch syndrome).\nHormone replacement therapy\nThere is a slightly increased risk of ovarian cancer in women who are taking hormone replacement therapy (HRT) after menopause. There is also an increased risk of ovarian cancer in women who have recently used HRT, even if they used it for less than 5 years. The risk of ovarian cancer is the same for HRT with estrogen only or with combined estrogen and progestin. \nWhen HRT is stopped, the risk of ovarian cancer decreases over time.\nThe risk of ovarian cancer is not affected by the age of the woman when taking HRT.\n Weight and height\nBeing overweight or having obesity is linked to an increased risk of ovarian cancer. Obesity is also linked to an increased risk of death from ovarian cancer. Being tall may also be linked to a slight increase in the risk of ovarian cancer.\nEndometriosis\nWomen who have endometriosis have an increased risk of ovarian cancer.\nThe following are protective\n factors  for ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancer:\nOral contraceptives\n Taking oral contraceptives (“the pill”) lowers the risk of ovarian\n\t\t\t cancer. The longer oral contraceptives are used, the lower the risk may\n\t\t\t be. The decrease in risk may last up to 30 years after a woman has stopped taking oral\n\t\t\t contraceptives. \nTaking  oral contraceptives increases the risk of blood clots. This risk is higher in women who also smoke. \nTubal ligation\n The risk of ovarian cancer is decreased in  women who have a tubal ligation (surgery to close both fallopian tubes). \nGiving birth\nWomen who have given birth have a decreased risk of ovarian cancer compared to women who have not given birth. Giving birth to more than one child further decreases the risk of ovarian cancer. \nSalpingectomy\nSome studies have shown that salpingectomy (surgery to remove one or both fallopian tubes) is linked with a decreased risk of ovarian cancer.  When both fallopian tubes are removed, the risk of ovarian cancer is lowered more than when one fallopian tube is removed.\nBreastfeeding\nBreastfeeding is  linked to a decreased risk of ovarian cancer. The longer a woman breastfeeds, the lower her risk of ovarian cancer. Women who breastfeed for at least 8 to 10 months have the greatest decrease in risk of ovarian cancer.\nRisk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy\nSome women who have a high risk of ovarian cancer may choose to have a risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (surgery to remove the fallopian tubes and ovaries when there are no signs of cancer).  This includes women who have inherited certain changes in the BRCA1\n and BRCA2\n genes or have an inherited syndrome. (See the  Risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO) section in the PDQ health professional summary on Genetics of Breast and Gynecologic Cancers for more information.)\nIt is very important  to have a cancer risk\n\t\t\t assessment and counseling before making this decision.  These and other factors may be discussed:\nInfertility.\n\tEarly menopause: The drop in estrogen levels caused by removing the ovaries can cause early menopause. Symptoms of menopause  can worsen and include the following: Hot flashes.\nNight sweats.\nTrouble sleeping.\nMood changes.\nDecreased sex drive.\nHeart disease.\nVaginal dryness.\nFrequent urination.\nOsteoporosis (decreased bone density).\nThese symptoms may not be the same in all women. Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) may be used to lessen these symptoms.\nRisk of ovarian cancer in the peritoneum:  Women who have had a  risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy continue to have a small risk of  ovarian cancer in the peritoneum (thin layer of tissue that lines the inside of the abdomen). This is rare, but may occur if  ovarian cancer cells  had already spread to  the peritoneum before the surgery or if some ovarian tissue remains after surgery.\nIt is not clear whether the  following  affect the risk of ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancer:\nDiet\nStudies of dietary factors have not found a strong link to ovarian cancer.\nAlcohol\nStudies have not shown a link between  drinking alcohol and  the risk of  ovarian cancer.\nAspirin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs\nSome studies of aspirin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have found a decreased risk of ovarian cancer and others have not. \nTalc\nStudies of women who used talcum powder (talc) dusted on the perineum (the area between the vagina and the anus) have not found clear evidence of an increased risk of ovarian cancer. \nInfertility treatment\nOverall, studies in women using  fertility drugs have not found clear evidence of an increased\n\t\t\t\trisk of ovarian cancer.  The risk of invasive ovarian cancer may be higher in women who do not get pregnant after taking fertility drugs.\nCancer prevention clinical trials are used to study ways \n    to prevent cancer.\nCancer prevention clinical trials are used to study ways to \n         lower the risk of developing certain types of cancer. Some \n         cancer prevention trials are conducted with healthy people who \n         have not had cancer but who have an increased risk for cancer. \n         Other prevention trials are conducted with people who have had \n         cancer and are trying to prevent another cancer of the same type \n         or to lower their chance of developing a new type of cancer. \n         Other trials are done with healthy volunteers who are not known \n         to have any risk factors for cancer.\nThe purpose of some cancer prevention clinical trials is to \n         find out whether actions people take can prevent cancer. These \n         may include eating fruits and vegetables, exercising, quitting \n         smoking, or taking certain medicines,  vitamins,  minerals, or \n         food supplements.\n\n      \n     New ways to prevent ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancer are being studied in clinical \n     trials. \nInformation about clinical trials supported by NCI can be found on NCI’s clinical trials search webpage. Clinical trials supported by other organizations can be found on the ClinicalTrials.gov website.\n",

The PDQ database contains summaries of the latest published information on cancer prevention, detection, genetics, treatment, supportive care, and complementary and alternative medicine. Most summaries come in two versions. The health professional versions have detailed information written in technical language. The patient versions are written in easy-to-understand, nontechnical language. Both versions have cancer information that is accurate and up to date and most versions are also available in Spanish.\nPDQ is a service of the NCI. The NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). NIH is the federal government’s center of biomedical research.  The PDQ summaries are based on an independent review of the medical literature. They are not policy statements of the NCI or the NIH.\nPurpose of This Summary\nThis PDQ cancer information summary has current information about ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancer prevention.  It is meant to inform and help patients, families, and caregivers. It does not give formal guidelines or recommendations for making decisions about health care.\nReviewers and Updates\nEditorial Boards write the PDQ cancer information summaries and keep them up to date. These Boards are made up of experts in cancer treatment and other specialties related to cancer. The summaries are reviewed regularly and changes are made when there is new information. The date on each summary (\"Updated\") is the date of the most recent change.\nThe information in this patient summary was taken from the health professional version, which is reviewed regularly and updated as needed, by the PDQ Screening and Prevention Editorial Board.\nClinical Trial Information\nA clinical trial is a study to answer a scientific question, such as whether one treatment is better than another. Trials are based on past studies and what has been learned in the laboratory. Each trial answers certain scientific questions in order to find new and better ways to help cancer patients. During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works. If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become \"standard.\" Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.\nClinical trials can be found online at NCI's website.

        "text": "What are BRCA1\n and BRCA2\n?\n\n  \n    \nBRCA1\n (BReast CAncer gene 1) and BRCA2\n (BReast CAncer gene 2) are genes that produce proteins that help repair damaged DNA. Everyone has two copies of each of these genes—one copy inherited from each parent. BRCA1\n and BRCA2\n are sometimes called tumor suppressor genes because when they have certain changes, called harmful (or pathogenic) variants (or mutations), cancer can develop.\n\n\nPeople who inherit harmful variants in one of these genes have increased risks of several cancers—most notably breast and ovarian cancer, but also several additional types of cancer. People who have inherited a harmful variant in BRCA1\n and BRCA2\n also tend to develop cancer at younger ages than people who do not have such a variant. \n\n\nA harmful variant in BRCA1\n or BRCA2\n can be inherited from either parent. Each child of a parent who carries any mutation in one of these genes has a 50% chance (or 1 in 2 chance) of inheriting the mutation. Inherited mutations—also called germline mutations or variants—are present from birth in all cells in the body.  \n\n\nEven if someone has inherited a harmful variant in BRCA1\n or BRCA2\n from one parent, they would have inherited a normal copy of that gene from the other parent (that’s because in most cases, embryos with a harmful variant from each parent cannot develop). But the normal copy can be lost or change in some cells in the body during that person’s lifetime. Such a change is called a somatic alteration. Cells that don’t have any functioning BRCA1 or BRCA2 proteins can grow out of control and become cancer.\n\n\n    \n\n  \n\n\n      \n\n              \n                    \n    How much does an inherited harmful variant in BRCA1\n or BRCA2\n increase a woman’s risk of breast and ovarian cancer?\n\n  \n    \nA woman’s lifetime risk of developing breast and/or ovarian cancer is markedly increased if she inherits a harmful variant in BRCA1\n or BRCA2\n, but the degree of increase varies depending on the mutation.\n\n\n About 13% of women in the general population will develop breast cancer sometime during their lives (1). By contrast, 55%–72% of women who inherit a harmful BRCA1\n variant and 45%–69% of women who inherit a harmful BRCA2\n variant will develop breast cancer by 70–80 years of age (2–4). The risk for any one woman depends on a number of factors, some of which have not been fully characterized. \n\n\nLike women with breast cancer in general, those with harmful BRCA1\n or BRCA2\n variants also have an increased risk of developing cancer in the opposite (contralateral) breast in the years following a breast cancer diagnosis (2). The risk of contralateral breast cancer increases with the time since a first breast cancer, reaching 20%–30% at 10 years of follow-up and 40%–50% at 20 years, depending on the gene involved.\n\n\n About 1.2% of women in the general population will develop ovarian cancer sometime during their lives (1). By contrast, 39%–44% of women who inherit a harmful BRCA1\n variant and 11%–17% of women who inherit a harmful BRCA2\n variant will develop ovarian cancer by 70–80 years of age (2–4).\n\n\n    \n\n  \n\n\n      \n\n              \n                    \n    What other cancers are linked to harmful variants in BRCA1\n and BRCA2\n?\n\n  \n    \nHarmful variants in BRCA1\n and BRCA2\n increase the risk of several additional cancers. In women, these include fallopian tube cancer (5, 6) and primary peritoneal cancer (7), both of which start in the same cells as the most common type of ovarian cancer. Men with BRCA2 variants, and to a lesser extent BRCA1\n variants, are also at increased risk of breast cancer (8) and prostate cancer (9–11). Both men and women with harmful BRCA1\n or BRCA2\n variants are at increased risk of pancreatic cancer, although the risk increase is low (12–14).\n\n\nIn addition, certain variants in BRCA1\n and BRCA2\n can cause subtypes of Fanconi anemia, a rare syndrome that is associated withchildhood solid tumorsand development ofacute myeloid leukemia(15–17). The mutations that cause these Fanconi anemia subtypes have a milder effect on protein function than the mutations that cause breast and ovarian cancer. Children who inherit one of these variants from each parent will develop Fanconi anemia.  \n\n\n    \n\n  \n\n\n      \n\n              \n                    \n    Are harmful variants in BRCA1\n and BRCA2\n more common in certain racial/ethnic populations than others?\n\n  \n    \nYes. The likelihood of carrying an inherited mutation in BRCA1\n or BRCA2\n (the prevalence) varies across specific population groups. While the prevalence in the general population is about 0.2%–0.3% (or about 1 in 400), about 2.0% of people of Ashkenazi Jewish descent carry a harmful variant in one of these two genes and the variants are usually one of three specific variants, called founder mutations. Other populations, such as Norwegian, Dutch, and Icelandic peoples, also have founder mutations (18).\n\n\nDifferent racial/ethnic and geographic populations also tend to carry different variants in these genes. For instance, African Americans have BRCA1\n variants that are not seen in other racial/ethnic groups in the United States (19–21). Most people of Ashkenazi Jewish descent in the United States who carry a BRCA variant have one of three specific variants (two in BRCA1\n and one in BRCA2\n). In the Icelandic population, a different variant in BRCA1\n is common among those who inherit a mutation in BRCA1\n. \n",

        "text": "Who should consider genetic counseling and testing for BRCA1\n and BRCA2\n variants?\n\n  \n    \nAnyone who is concerned about the possibility that they may have a harmful variant in the BRCA1\n or BRCA2\n gene should discuss their concerns with their health care provider or a genetic counselor.\n\n\nTests are available to see if someone has inherited a harmful variant in BRCA1\n and BRCA2\n. However, testing is not currently recommended for the general public. Instead, expert groups recommend that testing be focused on those who have a higher likelihood of carrying a harmful BRCA1\n or BRCA2\n variant, such as those who have a family history of certain cancers. Testing can be appropriate for both people without cancer as well as people who have been diagnosed with cancer. If someone knows they have a mutation in one of these genes, they can take steps to reduce their risk or detect cancer early. And if they have cancer, the information about their mutation may be important for selecting treatment. \n\n\nBefore testing is done, a person will usually have a risk assessment, in which they meet with a genetic counselor or other health care provider to review factors such as which of their relatives had cancer, what cancers they had, and at what ages they were diagnosed. If this assessment suggests that someone has an increased risk of carrying a harmful BRCA1\n or BRCA2\n gene variant, their genetic counselor can discuss the benefits and harms of testing with them and order the appropriate genetic test, if the individual decides to have genetic testing (22). \n\n\nSome people may choose to have genetic testing via direct-to-consumer (DTC) testing. Genetic counseling is recommended for those people as well to help them understand the test results and to make sure the most appropriate test was done. People should be aware that DTC tests may not be comprehensive, in that some tests do not test for all of the harmful mutations in the two genes. So receiving a negative result with a DTC test may not mean that they don’t have a harmful variant in BRCA1\n or BRCA2\n.\n\n\nThe United States Preventive Services Task ForceExit Disclaimer recommends risk assessment for women who have a personal or family history of breast, ovarian, fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer or whose ancestry is associated with having harmful BRCA1\n and BRCA2\n variants, as well as follow-up genetic counseling as appropriate.\n  \nThe National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) has criteria for genetic testing of BRCA1\n and BRCA2\n as well as for several other genes (including CDH1\n, PALB2\n, PTEN\n, and TP53\n) that are associated with increased risk of breast and/or ovarian cancer (23). NCCN recommends risk assessment for people who have a blood relative with a known or likely harmful variant in any of these genes; who have certain personal and/or family histories of cancer (cancer diagnosed at a younger age, certain types of cancer, people with two or more cancer diagnoses, or families with multiple cases of cancer); or who have certain inherited cancer predisposition disorders, such as Cowden syndrome, Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, Li-Fraumeni syndrome, or Fanconi anemia. \n\n\nThe American Society of Clinical Oncology recommends that all women diagnosed with epithelial ovarian cancer be offered genetic testing for inherited variants in BRCA1\n, BRCA2\n, and other ovarian cancer susceptibility genes, regardless of the clinical features of their disease or their family history (24).\n\n\nProfessional societies do not recommend that children under age 18 undergo genetic testing for BRCA1\n and BRCA2\n variants. This is because there are no risk-reduction strategies that are specifically meant for children, and children are very unlikely to develop a cancer related to an inherited BRCA variant. \n\n\nTesting for inherited BRCA1\n and BRCA2\n variants may be done using a blood sample or asaliva sample. That is because blood cells and cells that are present in saliva, like every cell in the body, contain the BRCA1\n and BRCA2\n genes. Sometimes people with cancer find out that they have a BRCA1\n or BRCA2\n mutation when their tumor is tested to see if they are a candidate for treatment with a particular targeted therapy. Because harmful BRCA variants reported in the tumor may be of somatic or germline origin, someone with such a variant in their tumor should consider having a germline genetic (blood) test to determine if the variant was inherited. \n\n\nWhen a family history suggests the possibility that someone without cancer may have inherited a harmful variant in BRCA1\n or BRCA2\n, it is best for a family member who has already been diagnosed with cancer to be tested, if such a person is alive and willing to get tested. If such testing reveals a known harmful variant, then testing the individual for that variant will provide a clear indication of whether they also carry it. If all family members with cancer are deceased or are unwilling or unable to have genetic testing, testing family members who have not been diagnosed with cancer may still be of value and provide good information. \n\n\n    \n\n  \n\n\n      \n\n              \n                    \n    Does health insurance cover the cost of genetic testing for BRCA1\n and BRCA2\n variants?\n\n  \n    \nPeople considering BRCA1\n and BRCA2\n variant testing may want to confirm their insurance coverage for genetic counseling and testing. Genetic counselors can often help answer questions about insurance coverage for genetic testing.\n\n\nSome genetic testing companies may offer testing for inherited BRCA1\n and BRCA2\n variants at no charge to patients who lack insurance and meet specific financial and medical criteria.\n\n\n    \n\n  \n\n\n      \n\n              \n                    \n    What do BRCA1\n and BRCA2\n genetic test results mean?\n\n  \n    \nBRCA1\n and BRCA2\n mutation testing can give several possible results: a positive result, a negative result, or a variant of uncertain significance (VUS) result.\n\n\n A positive test result indicates that a person has inherited a known harmful variant in BRCA1\n or BRCA2\n (these are typically called “pathogenic” or “likely pathogenic” variants on laboratory test reports) and has an increased risk of developing certain cancers. However, a positive test result cannot tell whether or when the tested individual will develop cancer. Some people who inherit a harmful BRCA1\n or BRCA2\n variant never develop cancer.\n\n\nA positive test result may also have important implications for family members, including future generations.\n\n\nBoth men and women who inherit a harmful BRCA1\n or BRCA2\n variant, whether or not they develop cancer themselves, may pass the variant to their children. Each child has a 50% chance of inheriting a parent’s variant.\n\n\tAll blood relatives of a person who has inherited a harmful BRCA1\n or BRCA2\n variant are at some increased risk of having the variant themselves. For example, each of that person’s full siblings has a 50% chance of having inherited the variant as well.\n\n\tVery rarely, an individual may test positive for a harmful variant not inherited from either parent. This is called a de novo\n (or “new”) variant. Such a variant is one that arose in agerm cell(sperm or egg) of one of the parents and is present in all the cells of the person who grew from that cell. The children of someone with ade novo variant(but not his or her siblings) are at risk of inheriting the variant.\n A negative test result can have several meanings, depending on the personal and family medical history of the person who is tested and whether or not a harmful mutation has already been identified in the family. If a close blood relative of the tested person is known to carry a harmful BRCA1\n or BRCA2\n variant, a negative test result is clear: it means the tested person did not inherit the harmful variant that is present in the family and cannot pass it to their children. A person with such a test result, called a true negative, has a risk of cancer that is similar to that of someone in the general population. However, there are other factors besides genetic factors that may increase the risk of cancer, such as radiation exposures at an early age, and those factors should be considered in assessing their risk of cancer. \n\n\nIf the tested person has nopersonal history of cancerand their family isn’t known to carry a harmful variant, then in this case, a negative test result is considered to be “uninformative.” There are several possible reasons why someone could have an uninformative negative test result:\n\n\nWithout testing family members who have had cancer, it is uncertain whether the negative test means that the person did not inherit a BRCA1\n or BRCA2\n mutation that is present in the family or whether the family history might be due to a mutation in another gene that was not tested or to other, nongenetic risk factors.\n\n\tThe individual may have a harmful variant that is not detectable by current testing technologies.\n\n\tRarely, there could be an error in the testing, either because inappropriate tests were recommended or ordered, genetic variants were interpreted incorrectly, or the wrong results were relayed to patients (25).\n Sometimes, a genetic test finds a change in BRCA1\n or BRCA2\n that has not been previously associated with cancer and is uncommon in the general population. This type of test result is called “a variant of uncertain significance,” or VUS, because it isn’t known whether this specific genetic change is harmful.   \n\n\nAs more research is conducted and more people are tested for BRCA1\n and BRCA2\n variants, scientists will learn more about uncertain changes and cancer risk. Clinicians and scientists are actively working to share information on these mutations so that they can be reclassified as either clearly harmful or clearly not harmful (26, 27). \n\n\nGenetic counseling can help a person understand what a VUS in BRCA1\n or BRCA2\n may mean in terms of their cancer risk. Until the interpretation of the variant is clarified, management of risk should be based on family history and other risk factors. However, it is important that a person who has a VUS test result regularly obtains updated information from the testing provider in case that VUS is reclassified as a harmful or likely harmful variant. Testing providers have different policies about notifying a tested person of a change in the interpretation of a VUS test result. Some will contact the tested person directly, whereas others place the responsibility on the tested person to check back in on a regular basis to learn of updates to the interpretation of their VUS test result. \n",

        "text": "How can a person who has inherited a harmful BRCA1\n or BRCA2\n gene variant reduce their risk of cancer?\n\n  \n    \nSeveral options are available for reducing cancer risk in individuals who have inherited a harmful BRCA1\n or BRCA2\n variant. These include enhanced screening, risk-reducing surgery (sometimes referred to as prophylactic surgery), and chemoprevention.\n\n\n Some women who test positive for harmful BRCA1\n and BRCA2\n variants may choose to start breast cancer screening at younger ages, have more frequent screening than is recommended for women with an average risk of breast cancer, or have screening with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in addition to mammography. \n\n\nNo effective ovarian cancer screening methods are known. Some groups recommend transvaginal ultrasound, blood tests for the CA-125 antigen (which can be present at higher-than-normal levels in women with ovarian cancer), and clinical examinations for ovarian cancer screening in women with harmful BRCA1\n or BRCA2\n variants. However, none of these methods appear to detect ovarian tumors at an early enough stage to improve long-term survival (28). \n\n\nThe benefits of screening men who carry harmful variants in BRCA1\n or BRCA2\n for breast and other cancers are not known. Some expert groups recommend that such men undergo regular annual clinical breast exams starting at age 35 (23). The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines recommend that men with harmful germline variants in BRCA1\n or BRCA2\n consider having a discussion with their doctor about prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing for prostate cancer screening starting at age 40 (29).\n\n\nSome experts recommend the use of ultrasound or MRI/magnetic retrograde cholangiopancreatography to screen for pancreatic cancer in people who are known to carry a harmful BRCA1\n or BRCA2\n variant and who have a close blood relative with pancreatic cancer (30). However, it is not yet clear whether pancreatic cancer screening and early pancreatic cancer detection reduces the overall risk of dying from a pancreatic cancer. \n\n\nAll of these screening approaches have potential harms as well as possible benefits. For example, MRI is more likely than mammography to result in false-positive findings. And there is some concern that women who have a harmful BRCA variant might be particularly sensitive to the DNA-damaging effects of tests that involve radiation (such as mammography) because they already have a defect in DNA repair (31). \n\n\n Risk-reducing, or prophylactic, surgery involves removing as much of the \"at-risk\" tissue as possible. Women may choose to have both breasts removed (bilateral risk-reducing mastectomy) to reduce their risk of breast cancer. Surgery to remove a woman's ovaries and fallopian tubes (bilateral risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy) can help reduce her risk of ovarian cancer. (Ovarian cancers often originate in the fallopian tubes, so it is essential that they be removed along with the ovaries.) Removing the ovaries may also reduce the risk of breast cancer inpremenopausal womenby eliminating a source ofhormonesthat can fuel the growth of some types of breast cancer. \n\n\nThese surgeries are irreversible, and each has potential complications or harms. These include bleeding or infection, anxiety and concerns about body image (bilateral risk-reducing mastectomy), and early menopause in premenopausal women (bilateral risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy).\n\n\nRisk-reducing surgery does not guarantee that cancer will not develop because not all at-risk tissue can be removed by these procedures. That is why these surgical procedures are described as “risk-reducing” rather than “preventive.” Some women have developed breast cancer, ovarian cancer, or primary peritoneal carcinomatosis(a type of cancer similar to ovarian cancer) even after risk-reducing surgery. Nevertheless, these surgical procedures greatly reduce risk. For example, in several studies women who underwent bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy had a nearly 80% reduction in risk of dying from ovarian cancer, a 56% reduction in risk of dying from breast cancer (32), and a 77% reduction in risk of dying from any cause during the studies’ follow-up periods (33).\n\n\nThe reduction in breast and ovarian cancer risk from removal of the ovaries and fallopian tubes appears to be similar for carriers of BRCA1\n and BRCA2\n variants (33).\n\n\n Chemoprevention is the use of medicines to reduce the risk of cancer. Two chemopreventive drugs (tamoxifen [Nolvadex] and raloxifene [Evista]) have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to reduce the risk of breast cancer in women at increased risk, but the role of these drugs in women with harmful BRCA1\n or BRCA2\n variants is not yet clear. Data from three studies suggest that tamoxifen may be able to help lower the risk of breast cancer in women who carry harmful variants in BRCA2\n (34) and of cancer in the opposite breast among BRCA1\n and BRCA2\n variant carriers previously diagnosed with breast cancer (35, 36). Studies have not examined the effectiveness of raloxifene in BRCA1\n and BRCA2\n variant carriers specifically. \n\n\nHowever, these medications may be an option for women who choose not to, or who cannot, undergo surgery. The potential harms of these drugs include menopausal symptoms, blood clots, stroke,increased risk of endometrial cancer (tamoxifen), and allergic reactions (raloxifene).\n\n\nBoth women in the general population, as well as those with harmful BRCA1\n or BRCA2\n variants, who have ever used oral contraceptives (birth control pills) have about a 50% lower risk of ovarian cancer than women who have never used oral contraceptives (37). Potential harms of oral contraceptives include increased risk of breast cancer, increased risk that a human papillomavirus (HPV) infection will become cervical cancer, and possible among older reproductive-age women.\n\n\n    \n\n  \n\n\n      \n\n              \n                    \n    What are the benefits of genetic testing for BRCA1\n and BRCA2\n variants?\n\n  \n    \nThere can be benefits to genetic testing, regardless of whether a person receives a positive or a negative result.\n\n\nThe potential benefits of a true negative result include a sense of relief regarding the future risk of cancer, learning that one's children are not at risk of inheriting the family's cancer susceptibility, and the possibility that special check-ups, tests, or risk-reducing surgeries may not be needed.\n\n\nA positive test result may allow people to make informed decisions about their future health care, including taking steps to reduce their cancer risk. \n\n\n    \n\n  \n\n\n      \n\n              \n                    \n    What are the possible harms of genetic testing for BRCA1\n and BRCA2\n variants?\n\n  \n    \nThe direct medical harms of genetic testing are minimal, but knowledge of test results, whether positive or negative, may have harmful effects on a person’s emotions, social relationships, finances, and medical choices. \n\n\nDealing with uncertainty of an uninformative negative or a VUS test result is another potential harm. For this reason, it is important to have genetic counseling before undergoing genetic testing.\n\n\nResults of genetic tests are normally included in a person’s medical records, particularly if a doctor or other health care provider has ordered the test or has been consulted about the test results. Therefore, people considering genetic testing must understand that their results may become known to other people or organizations that have legitimate, legal access to their medical records, such as their insurance company or employer, if their employer provides the patient’s health insurance as a benefit.\n",

Triple-negative cancers are harder to treat and have a poorer prognosis than other types of breast cancers.\n\n\nIf someone has tumor genetic testing that reveals the presence of a harmful BRCA1\n or BRCA2\n variant in the tumor, they should consider having a germline genetic (blood) test to determine if the variant was inherited. Knowing if the variant was inherited is important for that individual to understand their risks to potentially develop other cancers in the future. It can also determine if other family members may be at risk of inheriting the harmful variant.\n",

        "text": "What is screening?\n\n        Screening is  looking for cancer before a person has any symptoms. This can help find\n\t\tcancer at anearly stage. When abnormal tissue or cancer is found early, it may\n\t\tbe easier to treat. By the time symptoms  appear, cancer may have begun\n\t\tto  spread.\nScientists  are trying to better understand which\n\t\tpeople are more likely to get certain types of cancer. They also study the things\n\t\twe do and the things around us to see if they cause  cancer. This\n\t\tinformation helps doctors recommend who should be screened for cancer, which\n\t\tscreening tests should be used, and how often the tests should be done.  \nIt is important to remember that your doctor does not necessarily\n\t\tthink you have cancer if he or she suggests a  screening test. Screening\n\t\ttests are given when you  have no cancer symptoms. \nIf a screening test result is abnormal, you may need to have more tests done to find out if you have cancer. These are called diagnostic tests.\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n        General Information About Ovarian, Fallopian Tube, and Primary Peritoneal Cancer\n\n        Key Points\nOvarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancers are diseases in which malignant (cancer) cells\n\t\t  form in the ovaries, fallopian tubes, or peritoneum.\nIn the United States, ovarian cancer is the fifth leading cause of cancer death in women.\n Different factors increase or decrease the risk of getting ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancer.\nOvarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancers are diseases in which malignant (cancer) cells\n\t\t  form in the ovaries, fallopian tubes, or peritoneum.\nThe ovaries are a pair\n\t\t  of organs in the female reproductive\n\t\t  system. They are located in the pelvis, one on each side of the\n\t\t  uterus (the hollow, pear-shaped\n\t\t  organ where a fetus grows). Each\n\t\t  ovary is about the size and shape of an almond. The ovaries produce eggs and\n\t\t  female hormones (chemicals that\n\t\t  control the way certain cells or\n\t\t  organs function).\nThe fallopian tubes are a pair of long, slender tubes, one on each side of the uterus. Eggs pass from the ovaries, through the fallopian tubes, to the uterus. Cancer sometimes begins at the end of the fallopian tube near the ovary and spreads to the ovary.\nThe  peritoneum is the tissue that lines the abdominal wall and covers organs in the abdomen. Primary peritoneal cancer is cancer that forms in the peritoneum and has not spread there from another part of the body. Cancer sometimes begins in the peritoneum and spreads to the ovary. \nOvarian epithelial cancer, fallopian tube cancer, and primary peritoneal cancer form in the same type of tissue. Studies of screening tests look at these cancers together.\nSee the following PDQ summaries for more information about ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancers:\nIn the United States, ovarian cancer is the fifth leading cause of cancer death in women.\nWhile ovarian cancer is rare, it is the leading cause of  death from cancer of the female reproductive system. From the mid-1980s to 2017, the number of new cases of ovarian cancer decreased slightly each year. There was also a slight decrease in the number of deaths from ovarian cancer each year from 2009 to 2018.\n Different factors increase or decrease the risk of getting ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancer.\nAnything that increases your chance of getting a disease\n\t\t  is called a risk factor. Anything that decreases your chance of getting a disease is called a protective factor.\nFor information about risk factors and protective factors for ovarian cancer, see the Ovarian, Fallopian Tube, and Primary Peritoneal Cancer Prevention summary.\nTalk to your doctor about your risk of ovarian cancer.\n",

Cancer screening trials also are meant to show whether early detection (finding cancer before it causes symptoms)  helps a person live longer or decreases a person's chance of dying from the disease. For some types of cancer, the chance of recovery is better if the disease is found and treated at an early stage.\nScreening tests have not been shown to decrease the chance of dying from ovarian cancer.\nScreening tests that have been studied include:\nPelvic exam\nPelvic exams to screen for ovarian cancer have not been shown to decrease the number of deaths from the disease. A pelvic exam is an exam of the vagina, cervix, uterus, fallopian tubes, ovaries, and rectum.    A speculum is inserted into the vagina and the doctor or nurse looks at the vagina and cervix for signs of disease.  The doctor or nurse also inserts one or two lubricated, gloved fingers of one hand into the vagina and places the other hand over the lower abdomen to feel the size, shape, and position of the uterus and ovaries. The doctor or nurse also inserts a lubricated, gloved finger into the rectum to feel for lumps or abnormal areas.\nTransvaginal ultrasound \nTransvaginal ultrasound (TVU) to screen for ovarian cancer has not been shown to decrease the number of deaths from the disease. TVU is a procedure used to examine the vagina, uterus, fallopian tubes, and bladder. An ultrasound transducer (probe)  is inserted into the vagina and used to bounce high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) off internal tissues or organs and make echoes. The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a sonogram. \nCA-125 assay\nA CA-125 assay is a test that measures the level of CA-125 in the blood.  CA-125 is a type of biomarker  (a substance released by cells into the bloodstream that may be a sign of a condition or disease). An increased CA-125 level is sometimes a sign of certain types of cancer, including ovarian cancer, or other conditions. \nStudies have also shown that using CA-125 levels and TVU together to screen for ovarian cancer does not decrease the number of deaths from ovarian cancer.\nScreening tests for ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancer are being studied in clinical trials.\nInformation about clinical trials supported by NCI can be found on NCI’s clinical trials search webpage. Clinical trials supported by other organizations can be found on the ClinicalTrials.gov website.\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n        Risks of Ovarian, Fallopian Tube, and Primary Peritoneal Cancer Screening\n\n        Key Points\nScreening tests have risks.\nThe risks of ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancer screening tests include the following:\n\t\t  Finding ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancer may not improve health or help a woman live\n\t\t\t longer.\nFalse-negative test results can occur.\nFalse-positive test results can occur.\nScreening tests have risks.\nDecisions about screening tests can be difficult. Not all screening tests are helpful and most have risks. Before having any screening test, you may\n\t\t  want to talk about  the test with your doctor.  It is important to know the risks of\n\t\t  the test and whether it has been proven to reduce the risk of dying from\n\t\t  cancer.\nThe risks of ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancer screening tests include the following:\n\t\t  \nFinding ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancer may not improve health or help a woman live\n\t\t\t longer.\nScreening\n\t\t\t may not improve your health or help  you live longer if  you have   advanced ovarian cancer or if it has already spread to\n\t\t\t other places in  your body. \nFalse-negative test results can occur.\nScreening test results may appear to be normal even though ovarian cancer is\n\t\t\t present. A woman who receives a false-negative test result (one that\n\t\t\t shows there is no cancer when there really is) may delay seeking medical care  even if she has symptoms.\nFalse-positive test results can occur.\n Screening test results may appear to be abnormal even though no\n\t\t\t cancer is present. A false-positive test result (one that shows there is cancer when there really isn't) can cause anxiety and is usually followed by more  tests  (such as\n\t\t\t  a laparoscopy or a laparotomy to see if cancer is present), which also have risks. Problems caused by tests used to diagnose ovarian cancer include infection, blood loss, bowel injury, and heart and blood vessel problems. A false-positive test result can also lead to an unneeded oophorectomy (removal of one or both ovaries).\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n        About This PDQ Summary\n\n        About PDQ\nPhysician Data Query (PDQ) is the National Cancer Institute's (NCI's) comprehensive cancer information database. The PDQ database contains summaries of the latest published information on cancer prevention, detection, genetics, treatment, supportive care, and complementary and alternative medicine. Most summaries come in two versions. The health professional versions have detailed information written in technical language. The patient versions are written in easy-to-understand, nontechnical language. Both versions have cancer information that is accurate and up to date and most versions are also available in Spanish.\nPDQ is a service of the NCI. The NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). NIH is the federal government’s center of biomedical research.  The PDQ summaries are based on an independent review of the medical literature. They are not policy statements of the NCI or the NIH.\nPurpose of This Summary\nThis PDQ cancer information summary has current information about ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancer screening.  It is meant to inform and help patients, families, and caregivers. It does not give formal guidelines or recommendations for making decisions about health care.\nReviewers and Updates\nEditorial Boards write the PDQ cancer information summaries and keep them up to date. These Boards are made up of experts in cancer treatment and other specialties related to cancer. The summaries are reviewed regularly and changes are made when there is new information. The date on each summary (\"Updated\") is the date of the most recent change.\nThe information in this patient summary was taken from the health professional version, which is reviewed regularly and updated as needed, by the PDQ Screening and Prevention Editorial Board.\nClinical Trial Information\nA clinical trial is a study to answer a scientific question, such as whether one treatment is better than another. Trials are based on past studies and what has been learned in the laboratory. Each trial answers certain scientific questions in order to find new and better ways to help cancer patients. During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works. If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become \"standard.\" Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.\nClinical trials can be found online at NCI's website. For more information, call the Cancer Information Service (CIS), NCI's contact center, at 1-800-4-CANCER (1-800-422-6237).\nPermission to Use This Summary\nPDQ is a registered trademark.

        "text": "Just as cancer affects your physical health, it can bring up a wide range of feelings you’re not used to dealing with. It can also make existing feelings seem more intense. They may change daily, hourly, or even minute to minute. This is true whether you’re currently in treatment, done with treatment, or a friend or family member. These feelings are all normal.\n\n\nOften the values you grew up with affect how you think about and cope with cancer. For example some people:\n\n\nFeel they have to be strong and protect their friends and families\n\n\tSeek support and turn to loved ones or other cancer survivors\n\n\tAsk for help from counselors or other professionals\n\n\tTurn to their faith to help them cope\nWhatever you decide, it's important to do what's right for you and not to compare yourself with others. Your friends and family members may share some of the same feelings. If you feel comfortable, share this information with them.\n\n\nYoung people with cancer can also learn more on the Emotional Support for Young People with Cancer page.\n\n\nOverwhelmed\n\n\nWhen you first learn that you have cancer, you may feel as if your life is out of control. This could be because:\n\n\nYou wonder if you're going to live.\n\n\tYour normal routine is disrupted by doctor visits and treatments.\n\n\tPeople use medical terms that you don't understand.\n\n\tYou feel like you can't do the things you enjoy.\n\n\tYou feel helpless and lonely.\nEven if you feel out of control, there are ways you can take charge. It may help to learn as much as you can about your cancer. The more you know, the more in control you'll feel. Ask your doctor questions and don't be afraid to say when you don't understand.\n\n\nFor some people, it feels better to stay busy. If you have the energy, try taking part in activities such as music, crafts, reading, or learning something new.\nDenial\n\n\nWhen you were first diagnosed, you may have had trouble believing or accepting the fact that you have cancer. This is called denial. It can be helpful because it can give you time to adjust to your diagnosis. It can also give you time to feel hopeful and better about the future.\n\n\nSometimes, denial is a serious problem. If it lasts too long, it can keep you from getting the treatment you need.\n\n\nThe good news is that most people work through denial. Usually by the time treatment begins, most people accept the fact that they have cancer and move forward. This is true for those with cancer as well as the people they love and care about.\nAnger\n\n\nIt's very normal to ask, \"Why me?\" and be angry at the cancer. You may also feel anger or resentment towards your health care providers, your healthy friends and your loved ones.  And if you're religious, you may even feel angry with God.\n\n\nAnger often comes from feelings that are hard to show. Common examples are:\n\n\nfear\n\n\tpanic\n\n\tfrustration\n\n\tanxiety\n\n\thelplessness\nIf you feel angry, you don't have to pretend that everything is okay. It's not healthy to keep it inside you. Talk with your family and friends about your anger. Or, ask your doctor to refer you to a counselor. And know that anger can be helpful in that it may motivate you to take action. \nFear and Worry\n\n\nIt's scary to hear that you have cancer. You may be afraid or worried about:\n\n\nBeing in pain, either from the cancer or the treatment\n\n\tFeeling sick or looking different as a result of your treatment\n\n\tTaking care of your family\n\n\tPaying your bills\n\n\tKeeping your job\n\n\tDying\nSome fears about cancer are based on stories, rumors, or wrong information. To cope with fears and worries, it often helps to be informed. Most people feel better when they learn the facts. They feel less afraid and know what to expect. Learn about your cancer and understand what you can do to be an active partner in your care. Some studies even suggest that people who are well-informed about their illness and treatment are more likely to follow their treatment plans and recover from cancer more quickly than those who are not.\nHope\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n    \n  \nOnce people accept that they have cancer, they often feel a sense of hope. There are many reasons to feel hopeful. Millions of people who have had cancer are alive today. Your chances of living with cancer—and living beyond it—are better now than they have ever been before. And people with cancer can lead active lives, even during treatment.\n\n\nSome doctors think that hope may help your body deal with cancer. So, scientists are studying whether a hopeful outlook and positive attitude helps people feel better. Here are some ways you can build your sense of hope:\n\n\nPlan your days as you've always done.\n\n\tDon't limit the things you like to do just because you have cancer.\n\n\tLook for reasons to have hope. If it helps, write them down or talk to others about them.\n\n\tSpend time in nature.\n\n\tReflect on your religious or spiritual beliefs.\n\n\tListen to stories about people with cancer who are leading active lives.\nStress and Anxiety\n\n\nBoth during and after treatment, it's normal to have stress over all the life changes you are going through. Anxiety means you have extra worry, can't relax, and feel tense. You may notice that:\n\n\nYour heart beats faster.\n\n\tYou have headaches or muscle pains.\n\n\tYou don't feel like eating. Or you eat more.\n\n\tYou feel sick to your stomach or have diarrhea.\n\n\tYou feel shaky, weak, or dizzy.\n\n\tYou have a tight feeling in your throat and chest.\n\n\tYou sleep too much or too little.\n\n\tYou find it hard to concentrate.\nIf you have any of these feelings, talk to your doctor. Though they are common signs of stress, you will want to make sure they aren't due to medicines or treatment.\n\n\nStress can keep your body from healing as well as it should.\n\n\nIf you're worried about your stress, ask your doctor to suggest a counselor for you to talk to. You could also take a class that teaches ways to deal with stress. The key is to find ways to control your stressand not to let it control you.\nSadness and Depression\n\n\nMany people with cancer feel sad. They feel a sense of loss of their health, and the life they had before they learned they had the disease. Even when you’re done with treatment, you may still feel sad. This is a normal response to any serious illness. It may take time to work through and accept all the changes that are taking place.\n\n\nWhen you're sad, you may have very little energy, feel tired, or not want to eat. For some, these feelings go away or lessen over time. But for others, these emotions can become stronger. The painful feelings don't get any better, and they get in the way of daily life. This may be a medical condition called . For some, cancer treatment may have added to this problem by changing the way the brain works.\n\n\nGetting Help for Depression\n\n\nDepression can be treated. Below are common signs of depression. If you have any of the following signs for more than 2 weeks, talk to your doctor about treatment. Be aware that some of these symptoms could be due to physical problems, so it's important to talk about them with your doctor.\n\n\nEmotional signs:\n\n\nFeelings of sadness that don't go away\n\n\tFeeling emotionally numb\n\n\tFeeling nervous or shaky\n\n\tHaving a sense of guilt or feeling unworthy\n\n\tFeeling helpless or hopeless, as if life has no meaning\n\n\tFeeling short-tempered, moody\n\n\tHaving a hard time concentrating, feeling scatterbrained\n\n\tCrying for long periods of time or many times each day\n\n\tFocusing on worries and problems\n\n\tNo interest in the hobbies and activities you used to enjoy\n\n\tFinding it hard to enjoy everyday things, such as food or being with family and friends\n\n\tThinking about hurting yourself\n\n\tThoughts about killing yourself\nBody changes:\n\n\nUnintended weight gain or loss not due to illness or treatment\n\n\tSleep problems, such as not being able to sleep, having nightmares, or sleeping too much\n\n\tRacing heart, dry mouth, increased perspiration, upset stomach, diarrhea\n\n\tChanges in energy level\n\n\tFatigue that doesn't go away\n\n\tHeadaches, other aches and pains\nIf your doctor thinks that you suffer from depression, he or she may give you medicine to help you feel less tense. Or, he or she may refer you to other experts. Don't feel that you should have to control these feelings on your own. Getting the help you need is important for your life and your health.\nGuilt\n\n\nIf you feel guilty, know that many people with cancer feel this way. You may blame yourself for upsetting the people you love, or worry that you're a burden in some way. Or, you may envy other people's good health and be ashamed of this feeling. You might even blame yourself for lifestyle choices that you think could have led to your cancer.\n\n\nThese feelings are all very common. It may help you to share them with someone. Let your doctor know if you would like to talk with a counselor or go to a support group.\n\n\nWhen I start to feel guilty that I caused my illness, I think of how little kids get cancer. That makes me realize that cancer can just happen. It isn't my fault.\n\n\nBecky\nLoneliness\n\n\nPeople with cancer often feel lonely or distant from others. This may be for a number of reasons:\n\n\nFriends sometimes have a hard time dealing with cancer and may not visit or call you.\n\n\tYou may feel too sick to take part in the hobbies and activities you used to enjoy.\n\n\tSometimes, even when you’re with people you care about, you may feel that no one understands what you’re going through.\n You may miss the support you got from your health care team. Many people have a sense that their safety net has been pulled away, and they get less attention. It’s common to still feel cut off from certain friends or family members. Some of them may think that now that treatment is over, you will be back to normal soon, even though this may not be true. Others may want to help but don’t know how.\n\n\nLook for emotional support in different ways. It could help you to talk to other people who have cancer or to join a support group. Or, you may feel better talking only to a close friend or family member, or counselor, or a member of your faith or spiritual community. Do what feels right for you.\nGratitude\n\n\nSome people see their cancer as a \"wake-up call.\" They realize the importance of enjoying the little things in life. They go places they've never been. They finish projects they had started but put aside. They spend more time with friends and family. They mend broken relationships.\n\n\nIt may be hard at first, but you can find joy in your life if you have cancer. Pay attention to the things you do each day that make you smile. They can be as simple as drinking a good cup of coffee, being with a child, or talking to a friend.\n\n\nYou can also do things that are more special to you, like being in nature or praying in a place that has meaning for you. Or, it could be playing a sport you love or cooking a good meal. Whatever you choose, embrace the things that bring you joy when you can.\nWays to Cope with Your Emotions\n\n\nExpress Your Feelings\n\n\nPeople have found that when they express strong feelings like anger or sadness, they're more able to let go of them. Some sort out their feelings by talking to friends or family, other cancer survivors, a support group, or a counselor. But even if you prefer not to discuss your cancer with others, you can still sort out your feelings by thinking about them or writing them down.\n\n\nLook for the Positive\n\n\nSometimes this means looking for the good even in a bad time or trying to be hopeful instead of thinking the worst. Try to use your energy to focus on wellness and what you can do now to stay as healthy as possible.\n\n\nDon't Blame Yourself for Your Cancer\n\n\nSome people believe that they got cancer because of something they did or did not do. But scientists don't know why one person gets cancer and one person doesn't. All bodies are different. Remember, cancer can happen to anyone.\n\n\nDon't Try to Be Upbeat If You're Not\n\n\nMany people say they want to have the freedom to give in to their feelings sometimes. As one woman said, “When it gets really bad, I just tell my family I'm having a bad cancer day and go upstairs and crawl into bed.”\n\n\nYou Choose When to Talk about Your Cancer\n\n\nIt can be hard for people to know how to talk to you about your cancer. Often loved ones mean well, but they don't know what to say or how to act. You can make them feel more at ease by asking them what they think or how they feel.\n\n\nFind Ways to Help Yourself Relax\n\n\nWhatever activity helps you unwind, you should take some time to do it. Meditation, guided imagery, and relaxation exercises are just a few ways that have been shown to help others; these may help you relax when you feel worried.\n\n\nBe as Active as You Can\n\n\nGetting out of the house and doing something can help you focus on other things besides cancer and the worries it brings. Exercise or gentle yoga and stretching can help too.\n\n\nLook for Things You Enjoy\n\n\nYou may like hobbies such as woodworking, photography, reading, or crafts. Or find creative outlets such as art, movies, music, or dance.\n\n\nLook at What You Can Control\n\n\nSome people say that putting their lives in order helps. Being involved in your health care, keeping your appointments, and making changes in your lifestyle are among the things you can control. Even setting a daily schedule can give you a sense of control. And while no one can control every thought, some say that they try not to dwell on the fearful ones, but instead do what they can to enjoy the positive parts of life.\n",

State the most important points first.\n\n\n There are many different types of cancer. \"Stage\" refers to the size of the cancer tumor and how far it has spread in your body. Knowing the name and stage of your cancer will help you find out more about your cancer and help your doctor decide which treatment choices you have.\n\n\n Ask your doctor to tell you about your treatment options. Ask how each treatment can help and which side effects you might have. Try to learn all you can about each choice. Let your doctor know if you need more time to think about these issues before you choose one. (For tips, see Questions to Ask Your Doctor About Your Treatment.)\n\n\n Your doctor needs to know your questions and concerns. Write down your questions and bring them with you to your visit. Ask your most important questions first, in case the doctor runs out of time. If you have a lot of questions, you may want to plan extra time to talk. You should also make sure to get a name and number of someone on staff to call in case you have follow-up questions. \n\n\n. Your health care team wants to know if you're worried about finances for your cancer treatment so they can help you find ways to manage them. For more details on this topic, see Managing Costs and Medical Information.\n\n\n All your questions are important and deserve an answer. It's okay to ask the same question more than once. It's also okay to ask your doctor to use simpler words and explain terms that are new to you. To make sure you understand, use your own words to repeat back what you heard the doctor say.\n\n\n Ask a family member or friend to go with you when you see your doctor. This person can help by listening, taking notes, and asking questions. If you can't find someone to go with you, ask your doctor if he or she will talk with a friend or family member over the phone.\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t      \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCancer Patients Say Clinical Notes Access Valuable\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNew law requires expanded access for patients to their medical information.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\n Tell your doctor how you like to hear updates and information about your cancer. For example, do you want it all at once or gradually as you go through treatment? Do you want all the details or just the main facts? It's also very\n important to let your health care team know which family members or friends they can share information with and when. \n\n\nSome advice may be wrong or misleading, or may not apply to you. \n\n\n Many patients have trouble remembering what they talk about with their doctor. Take notes or ask if you can record the conversation. You can also ask if the hospital or health system allows you to see your electronic clinic notes (see article on this page). \n\n\n. Your medical information is protected under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act(HIPAA). This law gives you the right to receive and review your medical records. It also gives you the right to choose who your information is shared with, including friends or family members.  This may be face-to-face, over the phone, or in writing. Your health care provider should let you know about your privacy rights, but make sure to ask any questions you may have about this topic. For more information, see the Department of Health and Human Services HIPAA page, or informational videos at HealthIT.gov.\n\n\n\n        \n        \n\n    ",

The people in your life may also feel worried, angry, or afraid. Family members may be very supportive, or they may start acting differently towards you. Some may feel guilty that they're not sick, or they may feel helpless, not knowing how to help you.\nAdjusting to the new situation\nWhen you find out you have cancer, daily routines may change for everyone. Schedules may be focused around treatment. Someone in your family may need to take time off from work to drive you to treatments. Or, perhaps you need help paying bills or cooking meals. You may need help with chores and errands. Other issues that often come up are:\nChanging Roles\nWhen someone has cancer, everyone in the family has to take on new roles and responsibilities. A child may have to do more chores, or a spouse may have to help shop or do carpool. It can be hard for some to adjust to these changes.\nMoney\nMost people find it stressful to keep up with money matters. Cancer can reduce the amount of money your family has to spend or save. If you're not able to work, someone else in your family may need to get a job. You and your family may need to learn more about health insurance and find out what will be covered and what you need to pay for. These and other money issues can be hard to deal with. For tips on handling bills and insurance, see Managing Costs and Medical Information.\nLiving Arrangements\nPeople with cancer sometimes need to change where they live or whom they live with. You may need to move in with someone else to get the care you need. Or, you may need to travel far from home for treatment. This can be stressful because you may feel that you're losing your independence, even if it's just for a little while.\nDaily Activities\nYou may need help with duties such as walking the dog, helping with meals, or coaching your children's teams. Asking others to do these things for you can be hard. But most people want to help and like to do so when you ask.\nWhile some families find it easy to talk about these changes, it's also common for others to find the challenges hard to discuss. If your family is having trouble talking about these issues, ask for help from your health care team or request a family meeting. Your doctor or nurse can refer you to someone who can help families talk about cancer.\nHelp from Other Family and Friends\nOnce people learn of your cancer, some will ask you how they can help. Others will wonder what they can do for you, but aren't sure how to ask. You can help your friends cope with the news by letting them assist you in some way. For example, ask them to drive your carpool or go to the store. Make a list of things you think you might need help with, so they can pick something they're able to do for you.\nDo What You Can\nYou probably can, and want to keep doing things on your own. It's important to let people know that you can still do some things for yourself. As much as you're able, keep up with your normal routine by making decisions, managing your home, running errands, and taking part in things you enjoy.\nAsk for Help\nIt's okay to ask for help if you need to. Asking for help is not a sign of weakness. Most likely your loved ones want to help you. You can also find volunteers to help you through churches or community groups. Professional helpers can be hired to assist you with physical care and other needs. You could also ask your doctor about respite care, which is when someone comes to your home and takes care of you while your family member goes out for a while.\nShow Gratitude for Your Caregivers\nCancer and its treatment are hard on everyone, especially the people who take care of you. Sometimes loved ones become run down and get sick from the stress. Because of this, they need to have balance in their life—time to take care of personal tasks and errands, rest, be with friends, or enjoy hobbies. Your caregivers will also need time to sort through their feelings about cancer. Let them know that you want them to have a break, and that it's okay for other people to take care of you for a while.\n\n\n\n        \n        \n\n    ",

You both may feel anxious, helpless, or afraid. You may even find it hard to be taken care of by someone you love.\nSome relationships get stronger during cancer treatment. Others are weakened. Nearly all couples feel more stress than usual when cancer occurs. They often feel stress about:\nKnowing how to best support each other and how to communicate\nDealing with new feelings that come up\nMaking decisions\nJuggling lots of roles (such as childcare, housekeeping, work, and caregiving)\nChanging their social life\nChanging their daily routine\nNot feeling connected sexually\nIt helps to know that people express their emotions in different ways. Some like to talk things out or focus on other people. Others like to focus inward by doing things, such as washing the dishes or fixing things around the house. These differences can cause tension because each person may expect the other to act the way they would in their place. To reduce stress, it may help to remind yourself that everyone reacts differently. But if you don't feel like your communication needs are being met, you may want to seek help from a counselor or social worker.\nI was so scared when my husband got cancer. I was afraid I wouldn't be able to help him or that he might not recover. And I was afraid to talk about my fears with him because I didn't want to upset him.\nIlene\nWays to Improve Communication\nSome couples find it easier to talk about serious issues than other couples. Only you and your partner know how you feel about this. The sections below may help you think about ways to communicate that work for both of you.\nShare the Decisions\nIncluding your spouse or partner in treatment decisions is important. Together you can meet with your doctor and learn about common symptoms, your treatment choices, and their side effects. This will help you plan for the upcoming weeks and months.\nHelp Each Other\nEveryone needs to feel needed and loved. You may have always been the \"strong one\" in your family, but now is the time to let your loved one help you. This can be as simple as letting the other person fluff your pillow, bring you a cool drink, or read to you. And in turn, make sure you help your partner. You can simply express gratitude and let them know you understand it's a tough time for them too.\nBe Open about Stress\nSome things that cause stress for you and your partner can't be solved right now. And yet sometimes talking about these things can be helpful. Look at the issues that bother you such as dealing with the unknown or feeling a strain between you. You may want to say up front, \"I know we can't solve this today. But I'd like to just talk about how it's going and how we're feeling.\" Getting things out into the open may help you both.\nBe a Team\nYou and your partner may need to be a team now more than ever. It may help to think things through together. Talk about what decisions you should make together and which ones you should make alone. You may want to decide what tasks to share and if other people in your life could help with them.\nMake Dates\nMany couples find that it helps to plan special occasions. Some days may end up being better than others, depending on how your partner feels. So you may need to be okay with last-minute changes.\nYour dates don't have to be fancy. It's about spending time together. That can mean renting a movie, going out to eat or for an event, or looking through old photos. It can be whatever you both like to do. You can also plan these dates to include other people, if you miss being around others.\n\n\n\n        \n        \n\n    ",

Even very young children can sense when something is wrong. They will see that you don't feel well, are away from home more often, or can't spend as much time with them as you used to. Children as young as 18 months old begin to notice what's going on around them. It's important to be honest. Telling the truth is better than letting them imagine the worst. Give your kids time to ask questions and express their feelings.\nWhat Children of All Ages Need to Know\nAbout Cancer\nNothing your child did, thought, or said caused you to get cancer.\nJust because you have cancer doesn't mean you'll die from it. In fact, many people live with cancer for a long time.\nYour child can't make you well. But there are ways he or she can make you feel better.\nScientists are finding many new ways to treat cancer.\nAbout Living with Cancer in the Family\nYour child is not alone. Other children have parents who have cancer.\nIt's okay to be upset, angry, or scared.\nYour child can't do anything to change the fact that you have cancer.\nFamily members may act differently because they're worried about you.\nYou will make sure that your children are taken care of, no matter what happens to you.\nAbout What They Can Do\nThey can help you by doing nice things like washing dishes, cleaning their room, or even drawing you a picture.\nThey should still go to school and take part in sports and other fun activities.\nThey can talk to other adults for support, such as teachers, family members, and religious or spiritual leaders.\nHow Kids May Act When You Have Cancer\nChildren can react to cancer in many different ways. For example, they may:\nBe confused, scared, lonely, or overwhelmed\nFeel guilty and think that something they did or said caused your cancer\nFeel angry when they are asked to be quiet or to do more chores around the house\nMiss the amount of attention they're used to getting\nRegress and behave as they did when they were much younger\nGet into trouble at school or at home\nBe clingy and afraid to leave the house\nLearn what can help children and teens who have a family member with cancer.\nTeens\nIf you have a teenager, know that they're at a time in their lives when they're trying to break away and be independent from their parents. Try to get them to talk about their feelings and ask questions. Tell them as much as they want to know about your cancer. Ask them for their opinions and, if possible, let them help you make decisions.\nTeens may want to talk with other people in their lives. Friends can be a great source of support for them, especially those who also have a serious illness in their family. Other family members, teachers, coaches, and spiritual leaders can also help. Encourage your teenage children to talk about their fears and feelings with people they trust.\nFor more information about support for teens, you may find it helpful to share this e-book When Your Parent Has Cancer: A Guide for Teens with them.\nAdult Children\nIf you have adult children, your relationship with them may change now that you have cancer. You may:\nAsk them to help with making health care decisions, paying bills, or taking care of the house\nAsk them to explain medical information\nNeed them to go to the doctor with you or pick up medicines\nRely on them for emotional support\nFeel awkward when they help with your physical care\nFor some parents, it may be hard to ask for comfort and care from their grown children. But it's important to talk about cancer with your family members, even if they get upset or worry about you. Try to include them when talking about your treatment. Let them know the choices you would like them to make about your care, in case you're too sick to make the choices yourself. (See Advance Directives.) Recognize that it may be hard for your children to have this talk and that, like you, they're trying to adjust to your illness.\nFor more details and age-related tips on talking to kids, your family and friends may find it helpful to read the NCI booklet, When Someone You Love Is Being Treated for Cancer.\n\n\n\n        \n        \n\n    ",

They can have many benefits. Even though a lot of people receive support from friends and family, the number one reason they join a support group is to be with others who have similar cancer experiences. Some research shows that joining a support group improves both quality of life and survival.\nSupport groups can:\nHelp you feel better, more hopeful, and not so alone\nGive you a chance to talk about your feelings and work through them\nHelp you deal with practical problems, such as problems at work or school\nHelp you cope with side effects of treatment\nTypes of Support Groups\nSome groups focus on all kinds of cancer. Others talk about just one kind, such as a group for women with breast cancer or one for men with prostate cancer. Some can be open to everyone or just for people of a certain age, sex, culture, or religion. For instance, some groups are just for teens or young children.\nSupport groups can also be helpful for children or family members. These groups focus on family concerns such as role changes, relationship changes, financial worries, and how to support the person with cancer. Some groups include both cancer survivors and family members.\n are \"meetings\" that take place online. People meet through chat rooms, listservs, webinars, social media (such as Twitter or Facebook), or moderated discussion groups. People often like online support groups because they can take part in them any time of the day or night. They're also good for people who can't travel to meetings, or live in rural areas. Some are sponsored by cancer organizations, while others aren't monitored. Therefore, always check with your doctor about any cancer information you receive to make sure it's correct.\n are when everyone dials in to a phone line that is linked together, like a conference call. They can share and talk to others with similar experiences from all over the country. There is usually little or no charge.\nWhere to Find a Support Group\nMany hospitals, cancer centers, community groups, and schools offer cancer support groups. Here are some ways to find groups near you:\nCall your local hospital and ask about its cancer support programs.\nAsk your social worker to suggest groups.\nTalk to other patients who have tried support groups.\nDo an online search for groups. Or go to the NCI database Organizations that Offer Cancer Support Services for suggestions.\nIs a Support Group Right for Me?\nBefore joining a support group, you may want to ask yourself if you're comfortable talking about personal issues. You can also think about what you hope to gain by joining one. A support group may not be right for everyone. Some people don't like to hear about others' problems. And some find that their need for a support group changes over time.\nIf you have a choice of support groups, visit a few and see what they are like. See which ones make sense for you. Although many groups are free, some charge a small fee. Find out if your health insurance pays for support groups.\nIf you're thinking about joining a support group, here are some questions you may want to ask the group's contact person:\nHow large is the group?\nWho attends (survivors, family members, types of cancer, age range)?\nHow long are the meetings?\nHow often does the group meet?\nHow long has the group been together?\nWho leads the meetings - a professional or a survivor?\nWhat is the format of the meetings?\nIs the main purpose to share feelings, or do people also offer tips to solve common problems?\nIf I go, can I just sit and listen?\nSupport groups vary greatly, and if you have one bad experience, it doesn't mean these groups aren't a good option for you. You may also want to find another cancer survivor with whom you can discuss your cancer experience. Many organizations can pair you with someone who had your type of cancer and is close to your age and background.\n\n\n\n        \n        \n\n    ",

Ovarian cancer is when malignant (cancerous) cells develop in, near, or on the outer layer of one or both ovaries. \nThere are many types of ovarian cancer. Normally, healthy cells in your body divide and form new cells to repair injuries and replace old or dying cells. Cancer cells are different because they:\nGrow uncontrollably, dividing into new abnormal cells\nOutlive normal cells\nLead to the growth of a tumor; this can put pressure on nearby organs \nCan spread, or metastasize to other parts of the body through the bloodstream or lymphatic system\nThe type of cancer is determined by the site where it started. So, when cancer cells are first formed in the ovaries and spread to other organs, it will be diagnosed and treated as ovarian cancer. "

However, this may increase the risk of breast cancer in women with the BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation, so additional research is needed.\nWomen with a documented hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC), also known as Lynch Syndrome, should undergo periodic screening mammography, colonoscopy, and endometrial biopsy \nIf a woman wishes to preserve her reproductive capacity, an option is to undergo screening by transvaginal ultrasonography every six months, although the efficacy of this approach is not clearly established\nA woman may consider removing both ovaries and fallopian tubes (bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy) if maintaining fertility is not important or she has completed her family\nThe risk of ovarian cancer should be clearly documented before surgery. This procedure does not offer absolute protection because peritoneal carcinomas occasionally can occur after bilateral oophorectomy, therefore counseling should be considered.

It is important to know that early-stage symptoms can be difficult to detect, although not always silent. Women need to be aware, listen to their bodies and .\nMost women with ovarian cancer are diagnosed with advanced-stage disease (Stage III or IV). This is because the symptoms, particularly in the early stages, are often not severe and present vaguely. During a pelvic exam, the disease is not detected unless the doctor notes enlargement of either of the ovaries.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tDid you know?\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tThere is no effective screening test for ovarian cancer. A Pap smear test does not detect ovarian cancer, but rather screens for cervical cancer.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tDetection and Diagnosis\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tAlthough there is no consistently reliable screening test to detect ovarian cancer, research in this area is ongoing.  If a woman has signs and symptoms of ovarian cancer, the following tests are available and should be offered especially to those at increased risk:\n This checks for an enlarged ovary or signs of fluid in the abdomen. The doctor examines the uterus, vagina, ovaries, bladder and rectum for any unusual changes such as a mass. Some cancers are very small before they spread and cannot be reliably detected by pelvic examination.\n This examination uses a small instrument placed in the vagina to look at the ovaries and uterus. This method is especially appropriate for women at increased risk for ovarian cancer or those with an abnormal pelvic exam.\nThis measures the level of CA-125, a protein found in higher levels in women with ovarian/fallopian tube cancer.  While CA-125 is an important test, it is not always a key marker for the disease. Some non-cancerous diseases of the ovaries can also increase CA-125 levels, and some ovarian cancers may not produce enough CA-125 levels to cause a positive test. For these reasons the CA-125 test is not routinely used as a screening test for those at an average risk for ovarian cancer, but rather as a baseline for monitoring.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tPositive Tests\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tIf any test returns an abnormal result, a woman should consult a gynecologic oncologist. As a cancer specialist, they will evaluate the test results and may conduct a CT scan. However, the most accurate way to confirm an ovarian cancer diagnosis is by biopsy, a procedure in which the doctor takes a sample of the tumor and examines it under a microscope.",

Cancerous ovarian tumors start from three common cell types:\nSurface epithelium are cells covering the outer lining of the ovaries\nGerm cells are cells that will form eggs\nStromal cells release hormones and connect the different structures of the ovaries\n develop from the cells covering the outer surface of the ovary. Most epithelial ovarian tumors are benign (noncancerous). There are several types of benign epithelial tumors, including serous adenomas, mucinous adenomas and Brenner tumors. Cancerous epithelial tumors are carcinomas, meaning they begin in the tissue that lines the ovaries. These are the most common and most dangerous of all types of ovarian cancers, accounting for 85 to 90 percent of all cancers of the ovaries. Unfortunately, almost 70 percent of women with the common epithelial ovarian cancer are not diagnosed until the disease is advanced in stage.\nUnder the microscope, some ovarian epithelial tumors do not clearly identify as cancerous. These are called borderline tumors or tumors of low malignant potential (LMP tumors).\n develop from the cells that produce the ova or eggs. Most germ cell tumors are benign (non-cancerous), although some are cancerous and may be life-threatening. The most common germ cell malignancies are maturing teratomas, dysgerminomas and endodermal sinus tumors. Germ cell malignancies occur most often in teenagers and women in their twenties. Today, 90 percent of patients with ovarian germ cell malignancies can be cured and preserve their fertility.\n are a rare class of tumors that develop from connective tissue cells that hold the ovary together and  produce the female hormones (estrogen and progesterone0. The most common types are granulosa-theca tumors and Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors. These tumors are quite rare and are usually considered low-grade cancers, with approximately 70 percent presenting as Stage I disease (cancer is limited to one or both ovaries). Granulosa cell tumors (GCTs) are considered stromal tumors and include those composed of granulosa cells, theca cells and fibroblasts. GCTs account for approximately 2 percent of all ovarian tumors.\nThe removal of one’s ovaries eliminates the risk for ovarian cancer, but not the risk for a less common cancer called primary peritoneal carcinoma. This cancer is closely related to epithelial ovarian cancer – the most common type. It develops in cells from the peritoneum, the abdominal lining, and looks the same as epithelial ovarian cancer under a microscope; it’s also similar in symptoms, spread and treatment.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tStages of ovarian cancer\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n         \n          \n            \n          \n\n        \n\n      \n\n    \n\n\t\n\t\tView text version\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tWhen ovarian cancer is diagnosed, its type and stage can be determined during surgery. There are four stages of ovarian cancer, ranging from Stage I (early disease) to Stage IV (advanced disease). The treatment plan and prognosis (the probable course and outcome of the disease) will be determined by the stage of the cancer. These stages are:\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n         \n          \n            \n          \n\n        \n\n      \n\n    \n\n\t\n\t\tView text version\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tGrades of Ovarian Cancer\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tTumor grade is different from the cancer stage, as it describes how healthy the cancer cells look when viewed under a microscope. The doctor compares the cancerous tissue with healthy tissue. Healthy tissue is made up of many types of cells grouped together. If the cancer looks like the healthy tissue with different cell groupings, it is called differentiated or a low-grade tumor. If the tissue looks very different, it is called poorly differentiated or a high-grade tumor. The cancer’s grade may help the doctor predict how quickly the cancer will spread. It also helps determine a treatment plan decision. The tumor grades are:\n The grade cannot be evaluated\n The tissue is considered borderline cancerous; this is commonly called low malignant potential (LPM).\n The tissue is well-differentiated (contains many healthy-looking cells)\n The tissue is moderately differentiated (more cells appear abnormal than healthy)\n The tissue is poorly differentiated or undifferentiated (more cells appear abnormal and lack normal tissue structures)\n"

The type of surgery you have depends on your general health and how far the cancer has spread, which may not be known until it is performed.\nThe two main goals of ovarian cancer surgery are to stage the cancer and remove as much as possible, so there is no visual evidence of disease. This is known as debulking surgery\nIt’s possible to treat some ovarian cancers without removing the uterus and ovaries. These are important considerations for women of childbearing age to discuss, so it is important to have surgery performed by a gynecologic oncologist – a specialist in cancers of the female reproductive organs. Research shows that when a gynecologic oncologist treats a woman for ovarian cancer, she tends to fare much better than those who are not.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n",

The drugs given depend on the type of ovarian cancer. Usually, two different types of drugs are given together; there are many combinations of drugs. Chemotherapy may be used to:\nKill cancer cells that may be left after surgery (“adjuvant” chemotherapy)\nShrink ovarian tumors before surgery or radiation therapy to make the treatment easier (“neoadjuvant “ chemotherapy)\nKill any cancer cells that have spread (metastasized) to other parts of the body \nThere are different forms of chemotherapy, all given at a cancer center, hospital or doctor’s office:\nBy mouth in pill form \nInjected into a vein (IV) \nInjected into the intraperitoneal (IP) abdominal space by a catheter (thin tube)\nCirculated through the peritoneal cavity at the time of surgery (HIPEC)\nDosage and frequency may vary from once a day, once a week or even once a month, depending on the type of ovarian cancer and chemotherapy used. The duration of chemotherapy depends on what research shows to be the most effective for the particular type of cancer.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n \n\t\t\n\n\t\n \n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n \n\t\t\n\n\t\n \n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tManaging chemotherapy side effects\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tChemotherapy can cause physical, emotional and/or psychological side effects. Physically, it kills cancer cells, but can also attack some healthy cells and deplete the body’s strength. There are medications that can help manage those side effects. \nFor more on the common side effects caused by chemotherapy, along with helpful tips, download the NOCC booklet .\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n \n\t\t\n\n\t\n \n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n \n\t\t\n\n\t\n \n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tAnxiety and Depression\n\n\t\n\t\tMany women experience some form of anxiety and depression during their treatment. Refer to our  brochure for more information.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\nChemobrain (cognitive function)\n\n\t\n\t\tIt’s possible that memory problems, difficulties with concentration  or “fogginess” may occur while undergoing chemotherapy or other treatments. It’s important to talk to your doctor since there may be ways to manage or treat these symptoms. Other factors may also play a role, such as insomnia, fatigue, depression, stress and anxiety.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\nConstipation\n\n\t\n\t\tDuring treatment, it may be difficult to pass a stool (constipation). These changes can be caused by cancer treatment, changes in diet, pain medication and inactivity.  If constipation is severe or lasts more than a few days, talk to your doctor. It may help to:\nEat high fiber foods\nMove around as much as possible\nAdd a fiber laxative to your diet\nTalk to a doctor before using suppositories (laxatives other than fiber, stool softeners or enemas)\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\nDiarrhea\n\n\t\n\t\tDiarrhea is loose, watery stools (bowel movements). Diarrhea can be dangerous because the body may not absorb enough water and nutrients and can cause you to become dehydrated or malnourished. Chemotherapy and other cancer treatments can cause diarrhea or make it worse. If it’s severe or lasts more than a few days, talk to your doctor. It may help to:\nDrink plenty of fluids\nAvoid insoluble fiber (whole grains and bran, nuts and some vegetables)\nAdd soluble food (some fruit, including apples and berries, potatoes, lentils, peas, barley, oats and oat bran)\nEat small meals and often\nUse reduced-lactose products\nAvoid caffeine\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\nFatigue and Anemia\n\n\t\n\t\tFatigue (extreme tiredness) is one of the most common side effects of cancer and cancer treatment. Its symptoms include physical, emotional or mental exhaustion. It can also include difficulty concentrating or thinking clearly. \nAnemia is the result of a decrease in oxygen transported to the cells throughout the body. This can make you feel tired.  Anemia occurs when chemotherapy decreases the ability of the bone marrow to make red blood cells, lowering the amount of red blood cells to carry oxygen throughout the body. Tell your doctor if you are feeling extra tired or have other signs of fatigue or anemia. Here are some tips that may help:\nAdjust daily schedule\nEat well and stay hydrated\nAllow ample time to sleep\nConserve energy\nAsk for help when needed\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\nHair Loss\n\n\t\n\t\tFor many women, losing their hair (alopecia) is one of the most devastating side effects since it’s so visible and linked to a person’s identity and style. Chemotherapy can cause hair loss all over the body, including the eyebrows, eyelashes, arms and legs. Fortunately, the hair almost always grows back following treatment. To manage the stress from hair loss:\nCut your hair to prepare for hair loss\nConsider wearing a wig\nTreat hair gently and use a mild shampoo\nTry hats and scarves\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\nInfection\n\n\t\n\t\tMany chemotherapy drugs can reduce the number of white blood cells, increasing the chance of infection. During treatment, even minor infections can become a problem. Some signs of infection include fever, chills, diarrhea, pain and redness at surgical sites, or bloody or cloudy urine. Tell your doctor if you think you may have an infection. To prevent infection:   \nAvoid cuts and scrapes\nWash hands often\nAvoid crowds\nTrim nails carefully\nTake a warm bath or shower daily\nStay away from sick people\nDrink plenty of fluids\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\nInfertility\n\n\t\n\t\tAfter completing ovarian cancer treatment, some women maintain their fertility while others do not. If only one ovary was removed, it may still be possible to become pregnant. Some ovarian cancer treatments may cause infertility, including:\nSurgery to remove both ovaries\nChemotherapy that changes your menstrual cycle\nRadiation directed at the pelvic area that damages ovaries\nThere are options for those who want a family, including in vitro fertilization (IVF) with a donor egg, surrogacy and adoption.\nIt’s important to discuss your fertility preferences and options with your medical team so your treatment can be planned accordingly. If you have undergone treatment for ovarian cancer and wish to have children, we suggest that you see a reproductive endocrinologist – a doctor who specializes in infertility treatment.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\nMouth and Throat Problems\n\n\t\n\t\tChemotherapy can affect the healthy lining of your mouth, throat and tongue, causing difficulty in swallowing. In addition, the tissue inside the mouth can become irritated and dry, leading to a loss of appetite, mouth sores and infections. It may help to:\nKeep your mouth moist\nRinse your mouth frequently\nAvoid irritating foods and drinks\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\nNausea and Vomiting\n\n\t\n\t\tCancer treatment can cause nausea and vomiting. This can be prevented with certain medications. Be sure to discuss this with your doctor prior to treatment. Not every person experiences nausea and vomiting, but for those who do, the level of discomfort varies from person to person, drug to drug. It can last from hours, to a day or sometimes longer.  Here are some tips that may help:\nTake an anti-nausea medicine\nRelax before treatments\nAvoid greasy, high-fat foods\nEat and drink slowly\nRest after eating\nStay hydrated\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\nNerve and Muscle Problems\n\n\t\n\t\tChemotherapy can affect muscles and nerves, causing tingling, burning or numbness in the hands and feet (peripheral neuropathy). It can also cause loss of balance and clumsiness. It may help to:\nWear sturdy, non-slip shoes\nBe careful when bathing\nGrab items slowly\nSoak hands and feet\nMove carefully\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\nPain\n\n\t\n\t\tPain is a common side effect of cancer and can be caused by a tumor pressing on nerves, bones or organs. It can also be caused by cancer treatments. Talk to your doctor if you are uncomfortable. It may help to:\nTrack your pain levels daily and report trends to your doctor\nStay on schedule with medication; don’t wait until pain gets worse\nTry complementary therapies\nMeet with a palliative care or pain specialist\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\nSexual Side Effects\n\n\t\n\t\tIt’s not unusual to lose a desire for sex or are not as interested in it as usual during your treatment. This is understandable, given the emotional and physical stress. Treatment side effects such as nausea, fatigue and pain, along with changes in the body’s appearance (e.g., hair and weight loss) can also reduce libido. Common problems include menopause symptoms, sexual problems and infertility. \nThough a patient may be disinterested in sex and feel tempted to withdraw, they should communicate with their partner, address each other’s fears and stay connected. In time, by being tolerant of oneself and only doing what feels comfortable, and as health improves, a patient can look forward to feeling sexual again. It may help to:\nCommunicate needs and limits with your partner and address feelings of fear\nExplore non-sexual intimacy, such as hugging, cuddling, kissing and holding hands as satisfying additions or alternatives to sex\nRest and plan before and after sexual activity, and plan sexual activity during times of heightened energy levels\nUse water-soluble lubricants to help with vaginal dryness caused by hormonal changes\nContact a counselor or therapist to help with emotional issues and sexual problems associated with cancer treatment and recovery\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\nSkin Irritation\n\n\t\n\t\tChemotherapy and other treatments can cause rashes, itching and peeling skin, and increase sensitivity to the sun. Cracked and irritated skin can be more prone to infection, so it’s important to take care of your skin during treatment:\nApply sunscreen and lip balm\nUse skin products that are doctor recommended (soaps, lotions, moisturizers, powders)\nLet skin breathe\nStay clean and dry\nAdapted from National Cancer Institute and American Cancer Society materials https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/side-effects",

External beam radiation is the main type of radiation therapy used to treat ovarian cancer. Treatments are usually given five days a week for several weeks, with each radiation session lasting only a few minutes. \nThe radiation passes through the skin and other tissues before it reaches the tumor. This may cause side effects such as:\nSkin irritation that can make skin look and feel sunburned, with blisters and/or peeling at the site of the treatment\nFatigue\nNausea, vomiting and diarrhea\nThese side effects will start to improve once treatment is finished. Over time, any changes to the skin will usually return to normal about 12 months after the final treatment. It’s important to discuss all side effects with the healthcare team, and there may be ways to relieve some of the pain or irritation.\nWhile there are other radiation therapy procedures, external beam radiation therapy is the only one that is currently used in the treatment for ovarian cancer.",

This outstanding team began its work in July 2015, leveraging collaborative team science.\nThe SU2C-Ovarian Cancer Research Alliance-National Ovarian Cancer Coalition Dream Team focused on developing new therapies that target DNA repair and expanding PARP inhibitor use to women even beyond those with BRCA mutations. The team aimed to identify women at increased risk for ovarian cancer by screening for inherited mutations in genes linked to DNA repair, enabling these high-risk women to choose lifesaving preventative measures. Learn more about the SU2C-Ovarian Cancer Research Alliance-National Ovarian Cancer Coalition Dream Team.\nIn 2012, NOCC partnered with the GOG (Gynecologic Oncology Group) in funding the LIvES Study, overseen by the University of Arizona Cancer Center. The LIvES research initiative focused on a randomized, controlled trial study to test hypotheses relatingdietary intake and physical activity to improved progression-free survival and quality of life among women diagnosed with ovarian cancer.\nIn 2011, NOCC partnered with Ovarian Cancer Research Fund (OCRF) and funded “The Ann Schreiber Ovarian Cancer Research Training Program of Excellence: A Study by Dr. Ruth Perets”.

For anyone who chooses to join a clinical trial, they will receive the best care available and help themselves as well as others by contributing to research.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n \n\t\t\n\n\t\n \n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n \n\t\t\n\n\t\n \n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tWhat is an ovarian cancer clinical trial? Why should I consider participating?\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tClinical trials are research studies designed to find ways to improve health, answer scientific questions and find better ways to prevent, diagnose or treat cancer. For many women with ovarian cancer, investigational treatments may offer new hope. Through participation in these trials, patients may receive access to new therapy options that are not available beyond the clinical trial setting.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n \n\t\t\n\n\t\n \n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n \n\t\t\n\n\t\n \n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tClinical trial phases\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tThere are four main phases of clinical trials. This allows researchers to ask and answer questions as the trial progresses to ensure their information is reliable and protects the patient.\n Researchers first test a new drug or treatment in a small group (20-80) to evaluate its safety, determine safe dosages and identify side effects.\nThe study drug or treatment is given to a larger group (100-300) to see if it’s effective and to further evaluate its safety; often, new combinations of drugs are tested.\n Large groups (1,000-3,000) are given the study drug or treatment to confirm its efficacy, monitor side effects, compare it to commonly used treatments and collect information that will allow the drug or treatment to be used safely. Usually, patients are put into at least two groups – a standard group and an unspecified group, known as randomization. \nThis focuses on long-term effectiveness and side effects of drug or treatment post-FDA approval, and is conducted over an extended period of time.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n \n\t\t\n\n\t\n \n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n \n\t\t\n\n\t\n \n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tMyths and misconceptions about clinical trials\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\nIt’s advisable to bring a family member or friend along to learn about a clinical trial. Ask them to take notes and step in with questions if needed, such as:\nIs a clinical trial a treatment option for me?\nWhy is the study being done?\nWho’s running it?\nAm I eligible to participate?\nWhat phase is the clinical trial in?\nWhat are the benefits and risks?\nWill my insurance cover the costs?\nHow long will the study last?\nWill you still be my oncologist?\nWhat is informed consent?\nWhat are my rights as a patient?  Can I leave the trial at any time?\nNo. Clinical trials test the safety and benefits of new treatments as well as new combinations (or new doses) of standard treatments. You will get either the new treatment and/or the standard treatment. Sometimes, patients get the standard treatment plus a placebo rather than the standard treatment plus the new treatment (being studied).\nA growing number of states have passed legislation or instituted special agreements requiring health plans to pay the cost of routine medical care received by a participant in a clinical trial. Learn more about paying for clinical trials.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tTypes of trials\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tThese test the effectiveness of new treatments or ways of using existing treatments in people with cancer. Combinations of different treatment types may also be tested. Treatment trials can include new drugs or new combinations of current drugs, new surgery or radiation therapy techniques. They are also used to test vaccines or other therapies that stimulate the immune system to fight cancer. \nThese trials are conducted to find new ways to detect cancer, especially in the early stages.\nThese examine ways to increase the level of health and comfort for cancer patients.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tHow do I find a clinical trial?\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tIf you are thinking about joining a clinical trial as a treatment option, the best place to start is to talk with your doctor or another member of your health care team. Often your doctor may know about a clinical trial that could be a good option for you. He or she may also be able to search for a trial for you, provide information, and answer questions to help you decide about joining a clinical trial.\nYou can typically find the most recently updated listing of clinical trials online:\nClinicaltrials.gov is a resource provided by the U.S. National Library of Medicine; it is a database of privately and publicly funded clinical studies conducted around the world\nCenterwatch.com is a clinical trials listing service for ovarian cancer medical research trials actively recruiting patients\nEmergingmed.com Clinical Trial Navigation Service can assist in looking for clinical trials by filling a short questionnaire\n",

It includes natural products, mind and body practices and other approaches used along with standard medical treatments such as surgery, chemotherapy and radiation. Many women have benefited from the complementary therapies. \nSpeaking with other women and to the healthcare team can help find complementary therapies that may be most helpful and appropriate for individual lifestyles. These include:\nAcupuncture\nAromatherapy\nHerbal medicine\nMassage\nMeditation\nQi Gong (cheeGUNG)\nStress reduction\nYoga, Tai Chi\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n \n\t\t\n\n\t\n \n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n \n\t\t\n\n\t\n \n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\tSafe use of complimentary therapy\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tThere are questions about most complementary therapies that have not yet been answered through well­designed scientific studies, such as clinical trials.

By definition, these treatments are not integrated as part of standard medicine, and have not been proven safe or effective and are not recommended. It’s important that doctors are informed about all therapies and medications being considered.  \nCaution should be taken if alternative treatments are used in combination with standard therapies, as they may impact treatment outcomes. Additional information about complementary and alternative treatments can be found in the to order, call ­888­-OVARIAN (888­-682­-7426).",

        "text": "If you're helping your family member or friend through cancer treatment, you are a caregiver. This may mean helping with daily activities such as going to the doctor or making meals. It could also mean coordinating services and care. Or it may be giving emotional and spiritual support.\n\n\nThe tips below are for most cancer caregivers. More details are available for:\n\n\nCaregivers dealing with advanced cancer\n\n\tCaregiving after treatment ends\n\n\tParents with a child with cancer \n\n\tTeens with a family member with cancer\n\n              \n    \n            \n                    \n    Coping with Being a Cancer Caregiver\nGiving care and support during this time can be a challenge. Many caregivers put their own needs and feelings aside to focus on the person with cancer. This can be hard to maintain for a long time, and it’s not good for your health. The stress can have both physical and psychological effects. If you don’t take care of yourself, you won’t be able to take care of others. It’s important for everyone that you give care to .\n\n\nFor more information, see the NCI booklet When Someone You Love Is Being Treated for Cancer.\n\n\nChanging Roles\n\n\nWhether you're younger or older, you may find yourself in a new role as a caregiver. You may have been an active part of someone's life before, but perhaps now that they're a cancer patient, the way you support them is different. It may be in a way in which you haven't had much experience, or in a way that feels more intense than before.\n\n\nEven though caregiving may feel new to you now, many caregivers say that they learn more as they go through their loved one's cancer experience. Common situations that they describe:\n\n\nPatients may only feel comfortable with a spouse or partner taking care of them\n\n\tCaregivers with children struggle to take care of a parent too\n\n\tParents may have a hard time accepting help from their adult children\n\n\tCaregivers find it hard to balance taking care of a loved one with job responsibilities\n\n\tAdult children with cancer may not want to rely on their parents for care\n\n\tCaregivers may have health problems themselves, making it physically and emotionally hard to take care of someone else\nWhatever your roles are now, it’s very common to feel confused and stressed at this time. If you can, try to share your feelings with others or join a support group. Or you may choose to seek help from a counselor.\n\n\nMom was always the rock in the family. Now it's almost as though we're the parents and she's the child. It's hard because we have our own children to take care of and jobs to go to.\n\n\nBrian\n\n\nAsk for Help\n\n\nMany caregivers say that, looking back, they took too much on themselves. Or they wish they had asked for help from friends or family sooner. Take an honest look at what you can and can't do. What things do you need or want to do yourself? What tasks can you turn over or share with people? Be willing to let go of things that others can help you do. Some examples may be:\n\n\nHelping with chores, such as cooking, cleaning, shopping, or yard work\n\n\tTaking care of the kids or picking them up from school or activities\n\n\tDriving your loved one to appointments or picking up medicines\n\n\tBeing the contact person to keep others updated\nAccepting help from others isn't always easy. But remember that getting help for yourself can also help your loved one—you may stay healthier, your loved one may feel less guilty about all the things that you're doing, some of your helpers may offer useful skills and have extra time to give you. Websites such as SignUpGeniusExit Disclaimer or Lotsa Helping Hands Exit Disclaimercan help you organize requests and tasks.\n\n\nBe Prepared for Some People Not to Help\n\n\nWhen someone has a serious illness such as cancer, friends and family often reach out to help. And sometimes people you don't\n know very well also want to give you a hand. But it's important to realize that there are others who may not be able to help you. You might wonder why someone wouldn't offer to help you or your family when you're dealing with so much. Some common reasons are:\n\n\nSome people may be coping with their own problems\n\n\tSome may not have the time\n\n\tThey are afraid of cancer or may have already had a bad experience with cancer. They don't want to get involved and feel pain all over again\n\n\tSome people believe it's best to keep a distance when people are struggling\n\n\tSometimes people don't realize how hard things really are for you. Or they don't understand that you need help unless you ask them for it directly\n\n\tSome people feel awkward because they don't know how to show they care\nIf someone isn't giving you the help you need, you may want to talk to them and explain your needs. Or you can just let it go. But if the relationship is important, you may want to tell the person how you feel. This can help prevent resentment or stress from building up. These feelings could hurt your relationship in the long run.\n\n\n\n      \n\n              \n                    \n    Taking Care of Yourself\nAll family caregivers need support. But you may feel that your needs aren't important right now since you’re not the cancer patient. Or that there's no time left for yourself. You may be so used to taking care of someone else that it's hard for you to change focus. But caring for your own needs, hopes, and desires can give you the strength you need to carry on. (See the Caregiver's Bill of Rights in the booklet When Someone You Love Is Being Treated for Cancer: Support for Caregivers.)\n\n\nWays to Take Care of Yourself\n\n\nTaking time to recharge your mind, body, and spirit can help you be a better caregiver. You may want to think about the following:\n\n\n\n\n Take at least 15-30 minutes each day to do something for yourself. For example, try to make time for a nap, exercise, yard work, a hobby, watching tv or a movie, or whatever you find relaxing. Do gentle exercises, such as stretching or yoga. Or, take deep breaths or just sit still for a minute. See Learning to Relax.\n\n\t It's okay to cut back on personal activities, but do not cut them out entirely. For example, look for easy ways to connect with friends.\n\n\t If you can, try to keep doing some of your regular activities. If you don't, studies show that it can increase the stress you feel. You may have to do things at a different time of day or for less time than you normally would, but try to still do them.\n\n\t Find larger chunks of \"off-duty\" time by asking for help. Find things others can do or arrange for you, such as appointments or errands.\n\n\nGiving yourself an outlet for your own thoughts and feelings is important. Think about what would help lift your spirits. Would talking with others help ease your load? Or would you rather have quiet time by yourself? Maybe you need both, depending on what's going on in your life. It's helpful for you and others to know what you need.\n\n\nYou may also be able to find some comfort by reading the Feelings section of our website. See if any of them relate to you and what you can do for support.\n\n\n\n\nSupport groups can meet in person, by phone, or online. They may help you gain new insights into what is happening, get ideas about how to cope, and help you know that you're not alone. In a support group, people may talk about their feelings, trade advice, and try to help others who are dealing with the same kinds of issues. Some people like to go and just listen. And others prefer not to join support groups at all. Some people aren't comfortable with this kind of sharing.\n\n\nIf you can't find a group in your area, try a support group online. Some caregivers say websites with support groups have helped them a lot.\n\n\n\n\nSometimes understanding your cancer patient’s medical situation can make you feel more confident and in control. For example, you may want to know more about his type and stage of cancer. It may help you to know what to expect during treatment, such as the tests and procedures that will be done, as well as the side effects that will result.\n\n\n\n\nStudies show that talking with other people about what you're dealing with is very important to most caregivers. It's especially helpful when you feel overwhelmed or want to say things that you can't say to your loved one with cancer. Try to find someone you can really open up to about your feelings or fears. You're allowed to feel angry, frustrated, or overwhelmed.\n\n\nYou may want to talk with someone outside your inner circle. Some caregivers find it helpful to talk to a counselor, such as a social worker, psychologist, or leader in their faith or spiritual community. These types of experts may be able to help you talk about things that you don't feel you can talk about with friends or family. They can also help you find ways to express your feelings and learn ways to cope that you hadn't thought of before.\n\n\n\n\nCancer may bring you and your loved one closer together than ever before. Often people become closer as they face challenges together. If you can, take time to share special moments with one another. Try to gain strength from all you're going through together, and what you have dealt with so far. This may help you move toward the future with a positive outlook and feelings of hope.\n\n\n\n\nResearch shows that writing or journaling can help relieve negative thoughts and feelings. And it may actually help improve your own health. You might write about your most stressful experiences. Or you may want to express your deepest thoughts and feelings. You can also write about things that make you feel good, such as a pretty day or a kind coworker or friend.\n\n\n\n\nIt can be hard finding positive moments when you're busy caregiving. It also can be hard to adjust to your role as a caregiver. Caregivers say that looking for the good things in life and feeling gratitude help them feel better. And know that it's okay to laugh, even when your loved one is in treatment. In fact, it's healthy. Laughter releases tension and makes you feel better. Keeping your sense of humor in trying times is a good coping skill.\n\n\n\n\nYou may feel thankful that you can be there for your loved one. You may be glad for a chance to do something positive and give to another person in a way you never knew you could. Some caregivers feel that they've been given the chance to build or strengthen a relationship. This doesn't mean that caregiving is easy, stress-free, or not frustrating. But finding meaning in caregiving can make it easier to manage.\n\n\nCaring for Your Body\n\n\nWhen I get home from class, my mom and I take turns running while one of us stays with my dad. My run is my time for me, and the only way I can keep it together.\n\n\nGail\n\n\n\n\nYou may find yourself so busy and concerned about your loved one that you don't pay attention to your own physical health. But it's very important that you take care of your health, too. Doing so will give you strength to help others. It's important to:\n\n\n\n\tKeep up with your own checkups, screenings, and other appointments.\n\n\t\n\tStress can cause many different feelings or body changes. But if the changes last for more than two weeks, talk to your doctor. Some caregivers realize they have become depressed and need help.\n\n\t\n\tAsk your doctor to give you a large prescription to save trips to the pharmacy. Find out if your grocery store or pharmacy delivers.\n\n\t\n\tEating well will help you keep up your strength. If your loved one is in the hospital or has long doctor's appointments, bring easy-to-prepare food from home. For example, sandwiches, salads, or packaged foods and canned meats fit easily into a lunch container.\n\n\t\n\tListening to soft music or doing breathing exercises may help you fall asleep. Short naps can energize you if you aren't getting enough sleep. Be sure to talk with your doctor if lack of sleep becomes an ongoing problem.\n\n\t\n\tWalking, swimming, running, or bike riding are only a few ways to get your body moving. Any kind of exercise (including working in the garden, cleaning, mowing, or going up stairs) can help you keep your body healthy. Finding at least 15-30 minutes a day to exercise may make you feel better and help manage your stress.\nNew stresses and daily demands often add to any health problems caregivers already have. And if you're sick or have an injury that requires you to be careful, it's even more important that you take care of yourself. Here are some changes caregivers often have:\n\n\nFatigue (feeling tired)\n\n\tWeaker immune system (poor ability to fight off illness)\n\n\tSleep problems\n\n\tSlower healing of wounds\n\n\tHigher blood pressure\n\n\tChanges in appetite or weight\n\n\tHeadaches\n\n\tAnxiety, depression, or other mood changes\n\n\n      \n\n              \n                    \n    Long-Distance Caregiving\nIt can be really tough to be away from a loved one who has cancer. You may feel like you're a step behind in knowing what is happening with his or her care. Yet even if you live far away, it's possible for you to give support and be a problem-solver and care coordinator.\n\n\nCaregivers who live more than an hour away from their loved ones most often rely on the telephone or email as their communication link. But either of these methods can be rather limiting when trying to assess someone's needs. Aside from true medical emergencies, long-distance caregivers often need to judge whether situations can be dealt with over the phone or require an in-person visit.\n\n\nFinding Contacts Near Your Loved One\n\n\nDevelop a relationship with one or two key members of the health care team, such as a social worker or patient educator. It may help you feel more at ease to have direct contact with someone involved in the medical care of your loved one. Also, many long-distance caregivers say that it helps to explore both paid and volunteer support. Ways you can do this are:\n\n\nCreate a list of people who live near your loved one whom you could call day or night in a crisis or just to check in.\n\n\tLook into volunteer visitors, adult day care centers, or meal delivery services in the area.\n\n\tMake a list of websites in your loved one's area to give you quick access to resources.\n\n\tAsk if the hospital keeps visitor information packets or lists that list area agencies and contacts.\n\n\tRemember to share a list of home, work, and cell phone numbers with the health care team. You should also give this to others who are local in case of an emergency.\nOther Tips\n\n\nAsk a local family member or friend to update you daily by email or text. Or, consider creating a website to share news about your loved one's condition and needs. There are a number of sites available. Examples are Caring BridgeExit Disclaimer and Lotsa Helping HandsExit Disclaimer.\n\n\tSign up for online ways to connect with people. Programs using video and instant messaging to communicate are very common. For example, Skype and FaceTime are ways people connect from a distance.\n\n\tAirlines or bus lines may have special deals for patients or family members. The hospital social worker may also know of other resources, such as private pilots, advocacy organizations, or companies that help people with cancer and their families with transportation.\n\n\tIf you're traveling to see your loved one, time your flights or drives so that you have time to rest when you return. Many long-distance caregivers say that they don't allow themselves enough time to rest after their visits.\n\n\tConsider getting a phone card from a discount store to cut down on long-distance bills. Or, review your long-distance and cell phone plans. See if you can make any changes that would reduce your bills.\n\n\tFor more tips, see the National Institute on Aging's Long-Distance Caregiving page.\n\n\n      \n\n    \n\n\n        ",

        "topic": "Emotional Management:Fear of recurrence",
        "text": "The end of cancer treatment is often a time to rejoice. Most likely you're relieved to be finished with the demands of treatment. You may be ready to put the experience behind you and have life return to the way it used to be. Or you may be ready to have a fresh start at something new.\n\n\nYet at the same time, it's okay to feel sad and worried. It can take time to recover. Many are uncertain about how to move forward, feeling anxious about the future. It's very common to be thinking about whether the cancer will come back and what happens now. Often this time is called adjusting to a \"new normal.\" You will have many different feelings during this time.\n\n\nOne of the hardest things after treatment is not knowing what happens next. Those who have gone through cancer treatment describe the first few months as a time of change. It's not so much \"getting back to normal\" as it is finding out what's normal for you now. People often say that life has new meaning or that they look at things differently.\n\n\nYour new normal may include:\n\n\nMaking changes in the way you eat and what you do\n\n\tNew or different sources of support\n\n\tPermanent scars on your body\n\n\tNot be able to do some things you used to do more easily\n\n\tNew routines than you had before\n\n\tEmotional scars from going through so much\nYou may see yourself in a different way, or find that others think of you differently now. Whatever your new normal may be, give yourself time to adapt to the changes. Take it one day at a time.\n\n\nCoping with Fear of Cancer Recurrence\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t      \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tManaging Anxiety and Distress in Cancer Survivors\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tResearchers are exploring ways to support survivors’ mental health needs.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\nWhen cancer treatment is over, patients are often faced with mixed emotions. While there is happiness and relief that come with the end of treatment, survivors may also feel fear and anxiety. Probably the most common fear is that the cancer will come back (a  cancer recurrence).\n\n\nFear of recurrence is normal and often lessens over time. However, even years after treatment, some events may cause you to become worried. Follow-up visits, certain symptoms, the illness of a loved one, or the anniversary date of the date you were diagnosed can all trigger concern.\n\n\nOne step you can take is to be informed. Understand what you can do for your health now, and find out about the services available to you. Doing so can give you a greater sense of control.\n\n\nEven though you can’t control whether or not your cancer recurs, there are steps you can take to help cope with your fears.\n\n\nTalk to your health care team\n\n\n Be honest about the fears of your cancer coming back so they can address your worries. The risk of recurrence differs in each patient. Your health care team can give you the facts about your type of cancer and the chances of recurrence. They can assure you that they’re looking out for you.\n\n\t Talk to your health care team if you’re having a symptom that worries you. You can get advice about whether or not to schedule an appointment. Just having a conversation with them about your symptoms may help calm your fears. And, over time, you may start to recognize certain feelings in your body as normal.\n\n\t Also take notes about any anxiety you feel. Write down questions for your health care team before follow-up visits so you can be prepared to tell them what you’ve been going through since your last check-up or conversation.\n\n\t If you find that your fears are more than you can handle, ask for a referral for someone to talk to. If thoughts about cancer recurrence interfere with your daily life, you might feel better seeing a counselor or therapist. A professional may help you put your concerns in perspective.\n\n\t Having a plan may give you a sense of control and a way to feel proactive with your health after treatment. See the next section to learn about your plan.\nTake care of your mind and body\n\n\nEven though you can’t control whether or not your cancer recurs, you can use your energy to focus on wellness and manage stress. Here are some things you can do to take care of your mind and body:\n\n\n Relaxation exercises have been proven to help people with stress and may help you relax when you feel worried. Meditation and yoga also help reduce stress.\n\n\t Sharing your feelings with friends and family may help you feel better and realize that you’re not alone. You can also join a support group to talk to others who are having the same fears.\n\n\t Moderate exercise (examples: walking, biking, swimming) can help reduce anxiety and depression. It also may improve your mood and boost your self-esteem.\n\n\t Talk to a dietician or nutritionist about the foods you should eat to stay healthy and maintain your strength.\n\n\t It may help you to express your feelings by writing in a journal or a notebook. Many people find that getting their thoughts on paper helps them to let go of worries and fears.\n\n\t Many survivors have found their faith, religion, or sense of spirituality to be a source of strength.\n\n\t Some people like to channel their energy by volunteering and helping others. Being productive in this way gives them a sense of meaning and lets them turn their attention on others. See the NCI booklet, Facing Forward: Making a Difference for ways to give back.\n\n\t Getting out of the house may help you focus on other things besides cancer and the worries it brings.\n\n\n        \n        ",

Follow-up care for cancer means seeing a health care provider for regular medical checkups once you're done with treatment.\n\n\nThese checkups may include bloodwork, as well as other tests and procedures that look for changes in your health, or any problems that may occur due to your cancer treatment. These visits are also a time to check for physical and emotional problems that may occur months or years after treatment ends.\n\n\nYour follow-up care plan, along with a summary of your cancer treatment, is part of what is called a survivorship care plan. This plan will have all the details that you and your doctor should discuss to ensure that you get regular care after your treatment ends.\n\n\nNote that the information in this section focuses on follow-up care for your cancer treatment. But it’s important that you keep getting your routine care from your primary care provider in addition to follow-up cancer care.\n\n\nGetting a Follow-Up Care Plan\n\n\nOnce your cancer treatment ends, you should receive a follow-up cancer care plan from your oncologist or someone on your treatment team. A follow-up care plan is a summary of your treatment, along with recommendations for your cancer care after treatment ends. Your plan may also include suggestions to help meet other needs, such as emotional, social, or financial issues. \n\n\n. For follow-up cancer care, you may see the same doctor who treated you for cancer, or you may see another health care provider, such as one who specializes in follow-up care for cancer survivors. Or you may decide to go to your primary care doctor. You can discuss which doctor(s) to see with your health care team.\n\n\nKeep in mind that once you choose which doctor to see, it may be up to you or a loved one to make sure each doctor communicates with the other about your care. Some research has shown that sometimes treatments or tests with one doctor aren't shared with the other doctor.  Ask both your doctors to send clinic visit notes to each other so everyone can be on the same page. \n\n\nFollow-up care for childhood cancer survivors is very similar to the steps for adults. While most of the information below is equally important for children, see Care for Childhood Cancer Survivors for more tips.\nCommon Questions After Treatment Ends\n\n\nWhen you receive your follow-up care plan from your doctor or other health care provider, answers to the questions below should be provided. Make sure to ask any other questions you may have:\n\n\nHow long will it take for me to get better and feel more like myself?\n\n\tWhich doctor(s) should I see for my follow-up care? How often?\n\n\tWhat symptoms should I watch out for?\n\n\tWhat tests do I need after treatment is over? How often will I have them?\n\n\tWhat are long-term health issues I might expect as a result of my cancer treatment?\n\n\tWhat is the chance that my cancer will return?\n\n\tWhat records do I need to keep about my treatment?\n\n\tWhat can I do to take care of myself and be as healthy as possible?\n\n\tCan you suggest a support group that might help me?\nYou might find it helpful to write these questions down. When you meet with the doctor or follow-up care specialist, you can take notes or record your talks to refer to later. Talk about any concerns you have related to your follow-up care plan.\nYour Follow-Up Care Schedule\n\n\nEach patient has a different follow-up care schedule. How often you return for follow-up visits is based on:\n\n\nThe type of cancer you had\n\n\tThe treatment you received\n\n\tYour overall health, including possible treatment-related problems\nIn general, people return to the doctor for follow-up appointments every 3 to 4 months during the first 2 to 3 years after treatment, and once or twice a year after that.\n\n\nAt these visits, you may have a physical exam along with blood tests and other necessary tests and procedures. Which tests you receive and how often you receive them will be based on what your doctor thinks is best for you when creating your follow-up care plan.\n\n\nSurvivorship Clinics\n\n\nSome cancer centers and hospitals have programs that specialize in long-term follow-up care for cancer survivors. Many NCI-Designated Cancer Centers and large community treatment centers offer some form of survivorship program or clinic for adults who have been treated for cancer. Also, the cancer education website OncolinkExit Disclaimer has a searchable databaseExit Disclaimer of survivorship clinics across the United States.\n\n\nFor children and adolescents, NCI’s Office of Cancer Survivorship provides information on where to get follow-up care after treatment, in addition to other post-treatment resources. In addition, the National Children's Cancer Society also provides a list of long-term follow-up care clinics for childrenExit Disclaimer who have had cancer.\nWhat to Tell Your Doctor During Follow-Up Visits\n\n\nWhen you meet with your doctor for follow-up visits, it’s important to talk openly about any physical or emotional problems you’re having. Always mention any symptoms, pain, or concerns that are new or that won’t go away.\n\n\nKeep in mind that just because you have new symptoms, it doesn’t necessarily mean the cancer has come back. It’s normal to have fears about every ache and pain that arises, but they may just be problems that your doctor can easily address.\n\n\nSome cancer treatments can cause problems that may not show up for months or years after treatment. These problems, calledlate effects, are specific to certain types of treatments and the dose received. When you discuss follow-up care with your doctor, they should talk with you about which late effects to watch for. Early medical attention can help reduce problems that may come from late effects. See Late Side Effects of Cancer Treatment  on this site to learn more.\n\n\nOther things you should tell your doctor:\n\n\nAny physical problems that interfere with your daily life, such as fatigue; problems with bladder, bowel, or sexual function; having a hard time concentrating; memory changes; trouble sleeping; or weight gain or loss\n\n\tAny new medicines, vitamins, herbs, or supplements you’re taking\n\n\tChanges in your family medical history\n\n\tAny emotional problems you’re having, such as anxiety or depression\nIt’s important to be aware of any changes in your health between scheduled visits. Report any problems to your doctor immediately. They can decide whether the problems are related to the cancer, the treatment you received, or an unrelated health issue.\nYour Treatment Summary\n\n\nYour oncologist or a member of your treatment team should give you a written summary of the treatment you received. Keep this with you to share with your primary care doctor and any other doctors you see. Many people keep their treatment summary in a binder or folder, along with their medical records. This way, key facts about your treatment will always be together.\n\n\nIt's important to always keep your treatment summary somewhere safe in case you need it years later. It's also helpful to keep records of any medical visits you ever have, so you have them in the future. If your primary care doctor keeps electronic medical records, find out how you can access these when needed.   \n\n\nTypes of health information in the treatment summary\n\n\nThe date you were diagnosed\n\n\nThe type of cancer you had\n\n\tPathology report(s) that describe the type and stage of cancer in detail\n\n\tPlaces and dates of each treatment, such as the details of all surgeries; the sites and total amounts of radiation therapy; and the names and doses of chemotherapy and all other drugs\n\n\tKey lab reports, x-ray reports, CT scans, and MRI reports\n\n\tList of signs and symptoms to watch for and possible long-term effects of treatment\n\n\tContact information for all health professionals involved in your treatment\n\n\tAny problems that occurred during or after treatment\n\n\tAny supportive care you received during treatment (such as medicines for depression or anxiety, emotional support, and nutritional supplements)\n Many cancer survivors say that getting involved with their follow-up care was a good way for them to regain some of the control they felt they lost during cancer treatment. Being an active partner with your doctor and asking for help from other members of the health care team is the first step. Knowing what to expect after cancer treatment can help you and your family make plans, lifestyle changes, and important decisions about the future.\nGuidelines for Follow-Up Care\n\n\nThe following programs or organizations provide helpful follow-up care guidelines for some cancers. You can use them to help you talk with your doctor, but they aren't meant to take the place of your doctor's knowledge or judgment.\n\n\nTheAmerican Society of Clinical OncologyExit Disclaimer (ASCO) provides care plans and follow-up care guidelines Exit Disclaimerfor cancer survivors.\n\n\nThe Children’s Oncology GroupExit Disclaimer, an NCI-supported clinical trials group, offers long-term follow-up guidelinesExit Disclaimer for survivors of childhood, adolescent, and young adult cancers. It also has a series of fact sheets called Health LinksExit Disclaimer, which provide information for healthy living after childhood cancer.\n\n\nThe OncoLife Survivorship Care PlanExit Disclaimer was developed by Livestrong and the University of Pennsylvania. It provides survivors of adult cancers with a personalized survivorship care plan, based on the information they enter into an online program.\n\n\nThe National Comprehensive Cancer NetworkExit Disclaimer (NCCN) includes information about follow-up care for cancer, along with guidance on making a follow-up care planExit Disclaimer.\nGuidelines for a Healthy Lifestyle\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t      \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tExercise Linked to Better Survival from Breast Cancer\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRegular physical activity before or after diagnosis found to be beneficial.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\nBoth during and after cancer treatment, many people want to find ways to reduce the chances of their cancer coming back. Some worry that the way they eat, the stress in their lives, or their exposure to chemicals may put them at risk for recurrence. Cancer survivors find that this is a time when they take a good look at how they take care of themselves and how they might live a healthier life.\n\n\n. Ask your doctor about developing a survivorship care plan that includes ways you can take care of your physical, emotional, social, and spiritual needs. If you find that it's hard to talk about these issues, it may be helpful to know that the more you do it, the easier it becomes. Your doctor may also suggest another member of the health care team for you to talk with about wellness, such as a social worker, nutritionist, clergy member, or nurse.\n\n\nSome general tips for all cancer survivors include:\n\n\n. Smoking after cancer treatment can increase the chances of getting cancer at the same or a different site.\n\n\n. Drinking alcohol increases the risk of certain cancers.\n\n\n. Eating well and staying active can help you reach a healthy weight and stay there. Eat well. A healthy and balanced diet is important for overall wellness. This includes eating fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and protein. Talk with your doctor or a dietitian to find out about any special dietary needs that you may have. You could also ask if you should talk to a nutritionist for guidance on eating a healthy diet.\n\n\n. A healthy and balanced diet is important for overall wellness.

You could also ask if you should talk to a nutritionist for guidance on eating a healthy diet.\n\n\n. Research suggests that staying active after cancer may help lower the risk of recurrence and lead to longer survival. In addition, moderate exercise (walking, biking, swimming) for about 30 minutes every—or almost every—day can:\n\n\nReduce anxiety and depression\n\n\tImprove mood and boost self-esteem\n\n\tReduce fatigue, nausea, pain, and diarrhea\nIt’s important to start an exercise program slowly and increase activity over time. Some people may need to take special care when starting new. Talk with your doctor before you begin any exercise program, and work with your doctor or a specialist (such as a physical therapist) if needed. If you need to stay in bed during your recovery, even doing small activities can help. Stretching or moving your arms or legs can help you stay flexible, and relieve muscle tension.\n\n\nOn a broader level, for patients, families, and providers, the American Society of Clinical Oncology's Survivorship Care CompendiumExit Disclaimer offers a collection of resources and tools for survivorship care programs and education. \nResearch in Follow-Up Care\n\n\nNCI recognizes the importance of follow-up care after cancer treatment. Below are examples of NCI-supported research to improve the lives of cancer survivors.\n\n\nChildhood Cancer Survivor Study (CCSS)Exit Disclaimer. The CCSS was created to gain new knowledge and educate cancer survivors about the long-term effects of cancer and cancer therapy, and to provide information about follow-up care.\n\n\nFollow-up Care Use Among Survivors (FOCUS). The FOCUS study was created to better understand the many aspects and quality of follow-up care, to document the prevalence of late and long-term effects of cancer and its treatment, to understand survivors’ knowledge of late and long-term effects, and to study health-related quality of life and behaviors in long-term survivors.\n\n\nHealthcare Delivery Research Program (HDRP). The HDRP was established by NCI’s Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences (DCCPS) in January 2015 to advance innovative research to improve the delivery of cancer-related care and follow-up care.\n\n\nSurvey of Physician Attitudes Regarding the Care of Cancer Survivors (SPARCCS). The purpose of the SPARCCS study was to identify perceptions, knowledge, and practices of primary care and oncology specialist physicians about follow-up care of adult cancer survivors after treatment.\n\n\n\n        \n        \n\n    ",

You may find that you’re still coping with the effects of treatment on your body. It can take time to get over these effects.\n You may experience changes that are very different from someone else's, even if that person had the same type of cancer and treatment.\nMany physical changes can be controlled. See Side Effects for more information about these physical changes and ways to manage them.  Talk to your doctor as soon as you notice any new problems.\nFor more information about physical changes after treatment for childhood cancer, see Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer (PDQ®)-Patient Version.\nCancer treatment also can cause side effects that may not show up for months or years after you’ve finished treatment. Late effects are specific to certain types of treatments and the dose received. When you and your doctor discuss your follow-up care, your doctor should talk with you about which late effects to watch for. Early medical attention often can reduce problems that can come from late effects.\nBone Loss\nChemotherapy, steroid medicines, hormonal therapy, or radiation therapy may cause thinning of the bones. With radiation therapy, bone loss will occur only in the part of the body that was treated.\nWays to Manage\nAfter cancer treatment, you should have regular check-ups. During these visits, your doctor or nurse will do a physical exam and may order tests to check for bone loss. You can help lower your risk of bone loss by:\nNot smokingor using other tobacco products\nEating foods that are rich in calcium and vitamin D\nWalking, jogging, or doing other weight-bearing exercise\nLimiting how much alcohol you drink\n If you had radiation to the head and neck, also see Mouth Changes for tips on managing bone loss in your jaw.\nBrain Changes\nSome chemotherapy drugs and radiation therapy to the brain can cause problems months or years after treatment ends. Late effects may include:\nMemory loss\nProblems doing math\nProblems concentrating\nSlow processing of information\nPersonality changes\nMovement problems\n Radiation to the brain can cause radiation necrosis. This problem may happen when an area of dead tissue forms at the site of the brain tumor. Radiation necrosis can cause movement problems, problems concentrating, slow processing of information, and headaches.\nWays to Manage\nAfter cancer treatment, you should have regular check-ups. If you have symptoms of brain changes, you will have tests to see whether they are due to the cancer or are late side effects of your treatment. If you have late side effects, your doctor or nurse:\nWill talk with you about ways to manage late side effects\nMay refer you to a physical, occupational, or speech therapist who can help with problems caused by late side effects\nMay prescribe medicine or suggest surgery to help with the symptoms\n See our information about Memory or Concentration Problems for more information about brain changes.\nEndocrine System Changes\nSome cancer drugs and radiation to the head and neck can damage parts of the endocrine system. The endocrine system is a collection of organs and glands that control body functions such as growth, sexual development, reproduction, sleep, hunger, and the way the body uses food.\nParts of the endocrine system that may be damaged by cancer treatment include the thyroid, ovaries, and testes. Radiation to the head and neck may damage the thyroid. Radiation to the pelvis may damage the ovaries in women or the testes in men. Problems caused by these changes may include early menopause, infertility, under-active thyroid, and weight gain.\nWays to Manage\n See Hot Flashes and Night Sweats (PDQ®) for more information about managing the symptoms of early menopause.\n. For information about sexual problems or managing infertility, see:\n If you develop problems with your thyroid, your doctor may prescribe a hormone replacement therapy and closely watch your response to the medication.\nEye Problems\nChemotherapy, hormone therapy, immunotherapy, and steroid medicines may increase the risk of cataracts. Cataracts are a problem in which the lens of your eye becomes cloudy. Cataracts can cause:\nBlurred, cloudy, or double vision\nSensitivity to light\nTrouble seeing at night\n Some chemotherapy drugs can cause dry eye syndrome. This is a problem in which your eyes do not produce enough tears. Symptoms include feeling as if your eyes are dry or have something in them.\nWays to Manage\nIf you are at risk for cataracts, you should have regular visits with an ophthalmologist (a medical doctor who treats eye problems).\nIf cataracts become serious, they can be treated with surgery. In this type of surgery, an eye surgeon will remove the clouded lens and replace it with a plastic lens. You will usually have local anesthesia and be able to go home the same day.\nIf you develop dry eye syndrome, your doctor may prescribe regular treatment with eye drops or ointments.\nHearing Loss\nTreatment with certain chemotherapy drugs (in particular, cisplatin and high doses of carboplatin) and high doses of radiation to the brain can cause hearing loss.\nWays to Manage\n If you had a cancer treatment that can cause hearing loss, you should have at least one visit with an audiologist after you have finished treatment. An audiologist is a professional trained in hearing disorders. Depending on the type and dose of cancer treatment that you received, you may need to see an audiologist more often.\n Let your doctor know right away if you notice changes in your hearing.\nHeart Problems\nCertain cancer drugs and radiation therapy to the chest may cause heart problems. Drugs that tend to cause heart problems include:\nTrastuzumab\nDoxorubicin\nDaunorubicin (Cerubidine)\nEpirubicin (Ellence)\nCyclophosphamide (Neosar)\n Heart problems caused by cancer treatment may include:\nA weakening of the heart muscle, which is known as congestive heart failure. It can cause shortness of breath, dizziness, and swollen hands or feet.\nCoronary artery disease, which occurs when the small blood vessels that supply blood and oxygen to the heart become narrow. It can cause chest pain or shortness of breath. This problem is more common in those who had high doses of radiation therapy to the chest.\nWays to Manage\nAfter cancer treatment, you should have regular check-ups. If you have heart problems, your doctor or nurse might suggest that you:\n  A heart-healthy diet includes a variety of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. It also includes lean meats, poultry, fish, beans, and fat-free or low-fat milk or milk products. Your doctor will probably recommend that you follow a diet low in salt, because salt can cause extra fluid to build up in your body, making heart problems worse. The American Heart AssociationExit Disclaimer has many tips for heart-healthy eating.\nDrinking too much fluid can worsen heart problems, so it's important for people who have heart failure to drink the correct amounts and types of fluid. Talk with your doctor about what amounts and types of fluid you should have each day. Let your doctor know right away if you have sudden weight gain. This could mean extra fluid is building up. Also, if you have heart failure, you shouldn't drink alcohol.\nCarrying extra weight can put added strain on your heart. Work with your health care team to lose weight safely.\nThe right type and amount of exercise can help keep you and your heart healthy.  Talk with your doctor about which activities you can safely do. Exercise can help you become more fit and stay as active as possible.\nTalk with your doctor about programs and products that can help you quit smoking. Also, try to avoid secondhand smoke. Smoking and drugs can make heart failure worse and harm your health. For help to quit smoking, visit  or call toll-free, 1-800-QUIT-NOW (1-800-784-8669).\nTo learn more about sleep problems and how they are managed, see our information on Sleep Problems.\nYour doctor may prescribe medicines based on the type of heart problem you have, how severe it is, and your response to certain medicines. Taking these medicines is important.\nJoint Changes\nRadiation therapy, some chemotherapy drugs, and steroids can cause scar tissue, weakness, and bone loss. These problems can lead to loss of motion in joints, such as your jaw, shoulders, hips, or knees. If you receive radiation therapy, these problems will occur only in the part of the body that was treated.\nWays to Manage\nIt is important to be aware of early signs of joint problems so these can be addressed before they worsen. These signs include:\nTrouble opening your mouth wide\nPain when you make certain movements, such as reaching over your head or putting your hand in a back pocket\n  He or she may refer you to a physical therapist who will assess your joint problems and give you exercises to do. Physical therapy exercises can decrease pain, increase strength, and improve movement. In some cases, your doctor may recommend a knee or hip replacement.\nLung Problems\nChemotherapy and radiation therapy to the chest may damage the lungs. Cancer survivors who received both chemotherapy and radiation therapy to the chest may have a higher risk of lung damage.  Lung damage can cause shortness of breath, wheezing, fever, dry cough, congestion, and feeling tired. Tell your doctor if you have any of these symptoms.\nWays to Manage\nIf you have serious trouble breathing, your doctor may prescribe oxygen therapy. Oxygen is most often given through nasal prongs or a mask that fits over your mouth and nose.  In some cases, you might receive oxygen through a ventilator.\n  Excess weight can make it hard to breathe. Work with your doctor and health care team to lose weight safely.\nTalk with your doctor about which activities you can safely do. Exercise can help you become more fit and stay as active as possible.\n  Talk with your doctor about programs and products that can help you quit smoking. Also, try to avoid secondhand smoke. Smoking and drugs can worsen lung problems and harm your health. For help to quit smoking, visit  or call toll-free, 1-800-QUIT-NOW (1-800-784-8669).\nYour doctor can prescribe medicines to help you relax when it is hard to breathe, relieve discomfort, and treat pain.\nSome people with lung problems take steroid pills. Steroids can interfere with the way the body uses specific nutrients, including calcium, potassium, sodium, protein, and vitamins C and D.\nIf you take steroid pills for lung problems, it is very important to eat a balanced diet that meets the Choose My Plate Food Guidelines. A healthy diet that includes foods from each food group can make up for some of the effects of steroid therapy.\nLymphedema\nLymphedema is a problem in which the lymph fluid does not drain like it should, builds up in the tissues, and causes swelling. You may be at risk for lymphedema if part of your lymph system is damaged during surgery to remove lymph nodes or by radiation therapy to areas with large numbers of lymph nodes. Lymphedema can develop many years after treatment.\nSee our Lymphedema page for more information, tips for managing, and signs to look for.\nMouth Changes\nRadiation therapy to your head or neck and some chemotherapy drugs can cause late side effects in your mouth. Problems may include dry mouth, cavities, or bone loss in the jaw.\nWays to Manage\nYou may be asked to have your teeth checked every 1 to 2 months for at least 6 months after radiation treatment ends. During this time, your dentist will look for changes in your mouth, teeth, and jaw.\nYour doctor or nurse may suggest that you open and close your mouth 20 times as far as you can without causing pain, three times a day, even if your jaw isn’t stiff.\nYour doctor or nurse may suggest that you drink 8 to 10 cups of liquid per day. Keep a water bottle handy so you can sip throughout the day. You may also find sucking on sugarless candy or chewing gum helpful.\nFloss and use a mouthwash with fluoride every day. Brush your teeth after meals and before you go to bed. Also, avoid mouthwashes that contain alcohol.\nAsk your dentist to contact your radiation oncologist before you have dental or gum surgery. There may be other treatment options besides surgery. Also, do not have teeth pulled from the part of your mouth that received radiation.\nSecond Primary Cancers\nCancer treatment can sometimes cause a new cancer many years after you have finished treatment. When a new primary cancer occurs in a person with a history of cancer, it is known as a second primary cancer. Second primary cancers do not occur very often, but they can happen.\nWays to Manage\nTalk with your doctor about the types of second cancers you may be at risk for.\nHave regular check-ups for the rest of your life to check for cancer—the one you were treated for and any new cancer that may occur. Your doctor can suggest tests you may need tolook for a new cancer and how often you should have them.\nTell your doctor if you have any new symptoms or problems.\n\n\n\n        \n        \n\n    ",

In general, your recovery will take much longer than your treatment did. Survivors often say that they didn't realize how much time they needed to recover. This can lead to disappointment, worry, and frustration for everyone. \n\n\nFamilies also may not realize that the way their family works may have changed permanently as a result of cancer. They may need help dealing with the changes and keeping the \"new\" family strong.\n\n\nSome survivors say they would not have been able to cope without the help and love of their family members. And even though treatment has ended, they still receive a lot of support. For other families, problems that were present before the cancer diagnosis may still exist, or new ones may develop. You may receive less support than you had hoped.\n\n\n\n\n For instance, if you used to take care of the house or yard before your treatment, you may find that these jobs are still too much for you to handle. Yet family members who took over for you may want life to go back to normal. They may expect you to do what you used to do around the house.\n\n\t. They may disappoint you, which might make you angry or frustrated. For example you may get less attention and concern than you did during treatment.\n\n\t. Even though you want to get back to the role you had in your family before, it may take a while to get into a routine.\nAt the same time you’re going through these things, your family is still adjusting too. It may be hard for all of you to express feelings or know how to talk about your cancer. To help your family members, you may want to share NCI's booklet for caregivers, Facing Forward: When Someone You Love Has Completed Cancer Treatment.\n\n\nGetting Help with Family Issues\n\n\nAfter treatment, you may want to consider getting help from someone to help you and your family adjust. Ask your doctor or social worker to refer you to a counselor. An expert on family roles and concerns after cancer treatment may help your family work on your problems.\n\n\nHow do you cope with family issues? Here are some ideas that have helped others deal with family concerns:\n\n\n For example, don't feel like you have to keep the house or yard in perfect order because you always did in the past.\n\n\t Roles in the family may change again and different emotions may get triggered. This is normal. \nGive yourself time. You and your family will be able to adjust over time to the changes cancer brings. Just being open with each other can help ensure that each person's needs are met. Good communication is still very important.\n\n\nTalking with Children and Teens\n\n\nHelp the children in your family understand that it may take a while for you to have the energy you used to have now that you are finished with treatment. Be open about what you can and can’t do.\n\n\nYou don't have to tell your kids about every checkup or every symptom that occurs. But do tell them if you still have side effects that make certain things hard for you to do. If you’re not able to do an activity or go to an event, the children may think that you’re unhappy or mad at them.\n\n\nChildren of cancer survivors have said that these things are important once their parent has finished treatment. That you:\n\n\nBe honest with them\n\n\tSpeak as directly and openly as possible\n\n\tKeep them informed about your cancer and involved in your recovery\n\n\tSpend extra time with them\nWith your permission, other family members should also be open with your children about your cancer and its treatment.\n\n\n\n        \n        \n\n    ",

For many types of cancer, it is also called stage IV (4) cancer. The process by which cancer cells spread to other parts of the body is called metastasis.\n\n\nWhen observed under a microscope and tested in other ways, metastatic cancer cells have features like that of the primary cancer and not like the cells in the place where the metastatic cancer is found. This is how doctors can tell that it is cancer that has spread from another part of the body.\n\n\nMetastatic cancer has the same name as the primary cancer. For example, breast cancer that spreads to the lung is called metastatic breast cancer, not lung cancer. It is treated as stage IV breast cancer, not as lung cancer.\n\n\nSometimes when people are diagnosed with metastatic cancer, doctors cannot tell where it started. This type of cancer is called cancer of unknown primary origin, or CUP. See the Carcinoma of Unknown Primary page for more information.\nHow Cancer Spreads\n\n\n            \nCancer cells spread through the body in a series of steps. These steps include:\n\n\ngrowing into, or invading, nearby normal tissue\n\n\tmoving through the walls of nearby lymph nodes or blood vessels\n\n\ttraveling through the lymphatic system and bloodstream to other parts of the body\n\n\tstopping in small blood vessels at a distant location, invading the blood vessel walls, and moving into the surrounding tissue\n\n\tgrowing in this tissue until a tiny tumor forms\n\n\tcausing new blood vessels to grow, which creates a blood supply that allows the metastatic tumor to continue growing\nMost of the time, spreading cancer cells die at some point in this process. But, as long as conditions are favorable for the cancer cells at every step, some of them are able to form new tumors in other parts of the body. Metastatic cancer cells can also remain inactive at a distant site for many years before they begin to grow again, if at all.\nWhere Cancer Spreads\n\n\nCancer can spread to almost any part of the body, although different types of cancer are more likely to spread to certain areas than others. The most common sites where cancer spreads are bone, liver, and lung. The following list shows the most common sites of metastasis, not including the lymph nodes, for some common cancers:\n\n\nSymptoms of Metastatic Cancer\n\n\nMetastatic cancer does not always cause symptoms. When symptoms do occur, what they are like and how often you have them will depend on the size and location of the metastatic tumors. Some common signs of metastatic cancer include:\n\n\npain and fractures, when cancer has spread to the bone\n\n\theadache, seizures, or dizziness, when cancer has spread to the brain\n\n\tshortness of breath, when cancer has spread to the lung\n\n\tjaundice or swelling in the belly, when cancer has spread to the liver\nTreatment for Metastatic Cancer\n\n\nThere are treatments for most types of metastatic cancer. Often, the goal of treating metastatic cancer is to control it by stopping or slowing its growth. Some people can live for years with metastatic cancer that is well controlled. Other treatments may improve the quality of life by relieving symptoms. This type of care is called palliative care. It can be given at any point during treatment for cancer.\n\n\nThe treatment that you may have depends on your type of primary cancer, where it has spread, treatments you’ve had in the past, and your general health. To learn about treatment options, including clinical trials, find your type of cancer among the PDQ® Cancer Information Summaries for Adult Treatment and Pediatric Treatment.\n\n\nWhen Metastatic Cancer Can No Longer Be Controlled\n\n\nIf you have been told your cancer can no longer be controlled, you and your loved ones may want to discuss end-of-life care. Whether or not you choose to continue treatment to shrink the cancer or control its growth, you can always receive palliative care to control the symptoms of cancer and the side effects of treatment. Information on coping with and planning for end-of-life care is available in the Advanced Cancer section of this site.\nOngoing Research\n\n\nResearchers are studying new ways to kill or stop the growth of primary and metastatic cancer cells. These ways include:\n\n\nhelping your immune system fight cancer\n\n\tdisrupting the steps in the process that allow the cancer cells to spread\n\n\ttargeting specificgenetic changes in tumors\nVisit the Metastatic Cancer Research page on this site to stay informed of ongoing research funded by NCI.\n\n\n\n        \n        \n\n    ",

Often, your doctor may know about a clinical trial that could be a good option for you. He or she may also be able to search for a trial for you, provide information, and answer questions to help you decide about joining a clinical trial.\n\n\nSome doctors may not be aware of or recommend clinical trials that could be appropriate for you. If so, you may want to get a second opinion about your treatment options, including taking part in a clinical trial.\n\n\nIf you decide to look for trials on your own, the steps discussed here can guide you in your search. The NCI's Cancer Information Service can also provide a tailored clinical trials search that you can discuss with your doctor. To reach them call 1-800-4-CANCER (1-800-422-6237) and select option 2. This is a free service. Keep in mind that the search results do not replace advice from your doctor.\n\n\nThis guide takes you through the following steps:\n\n\nStep 1: Gather Details about Your Cancer\n\n\nIf you decide to look for a clinical trial, you will need to know certain details about your cancer diagnosis and compare these details with the eligibility criteria of any trial that interests you. Eligibility criteria are the requirements that must be met for you to join a clinical trial. \n\n\nExamples of eligibility criteria include:\n\n\nHaving a certain type or stage of cancer\n\n\tHaving received (or not having received) a certain type of treatment in the past\n\n\tHaving specificgenetic changesin your tumor\n\n\tBeing in a certain age group\n\n\t\n\n\tCurrent health status\nTo help you gather details about your cancer, complete as much of the Cancer Details Checklist as possible. Refer to the form during your search for a clinical trial.\n\n\nIf you need help filling out the form, talk with your doctor, a nurse, or social worker at your doctor's office. The more information you can gather, the easier it will be to find a clinical trial to fit your situation.\nStep 2: Find Clinical Trials\n\n\n            \n \n\n\nThere are many lists of cancer clinical trials taking place in the United States. Some trials are funded by nonprofit organizations, including the U.S. government. Others are funded by for-profit groups, such as drug companies. Hospitals and academic medical centers also sponsor trials conducted by their own researchers. Because of the many types of sponsors, no single list contains every clinical trial.\n\n\n Whichever website you use to search for clinical trials, be sure to bookmark or print a copy of the protocol summary for every trial that interests you.\n\n\nA protocol summary should explain the goal of the trial and describe which treatments will be tested. It should also list the locations where the trial is taking place.\n\n\nKeep in mind that protocol summaries are written for health care providers and use medical language to describe the trial that may be difficult to understand. For help understanding the protocol summary, call, email, or chat with one of our cancer information specialists.\n\n\nNCI-Supported Clinical Trials\n\n\nNCI's website helps you find NCI-supported clinical trials that are taking place across the United States, Canada, and internationally. The list includes:\n\n\nAll NCI network trials, including trials supported through the:\n\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\n\tTrials that are funded in full or in part by NCI, including trials taking place at NCI-Designated Cancer Centers\n\n\tTrials at the NIH Clinical Center in Bethesda, Maryland\nIf you need help with your search, you can call, email, or chat with one of our trained information specialists. They will need to know details about your cancer, so have your Cancer Details Checklist ready.\n\n\nOther Lists of Trials\n\n\nIn addition to NCI's list of cancer clinical trials, you may want to check a few other trial lists.\n\n\nOther places to look for lists of cancer clinical trials include:\n\n\n\n\nClinicalTrials.gov, which is part of the National Library of Medicine, lists clinical trials for cancer and many other diseases and conditions. It contains trials that are in NCI's list of cancer trials as well as trials sponsored by pharmaceutical or biotech companies that may not be on NCI's list.\n\n\n\n\nMany cancer centers across the United States, including NCI-Designated Cancer Centers, sponsor or take part in cancer clinical trials. The websites of these centers usually have a list of the clinical trials taking place at their institutions. Some of the trials included in these lists may not be on NCI's list.\n\n\nKeep in mind that the amount of information about clinical trials on these websites can vary. You may have to contact a cancer center clinical trials office to get more information about the trials that interest you.\n\n\n\n\nMany companies provide lists of the clinical trials that they sponsor on their websites. Sometimes, a company's website may refer you to the website of another organization that helps the company find patients for its trials. The other organization may be paid fees for this service.\n\n\nThe website of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) includes a list of its member companiesExit Disclaimer, many of which sponsor cancer clinical trials. PhRMA is a trade organization that represents drug and biotechnology companies in the United States.\n\n\n\n\nSome organizations provide lists of clinical trials as a part of their business. These organizations generally do not sponsor or take part in clinical trials. Some of them may receive fees from drug or biotechnology companies for listing their trials or helping find patients for their trials.\n\n\nKeep the following points in mind about clinical trial listing services:\n\n\nThe lists of trials provided by these organizations often draw from the trial lists that are available from the U.S. government (NCI and ClinicalTrials.gov).\n\n\tThe websites of these organizations may not be updated regularly.\n\n\tThe websites of these organizations may require you to register to search for clinical trials or to obtain trial contact information for trials that interest you.\n\n\nCancer advocacy groups provide education, support, financial assistance, and advocacy to help patients and families who are dealing with cancer, its treatment, and survivorship. These organizations recognize that clinical trials are important to improving cancer care. They work to educate and empower people to find information and obtain access to appropriate treatment.\n\n\nAdvocacy groups work hard to know about the latest advances in cancer research. Some will have information about clinical trials that are enrolling patients.\n\n\nTo find trials, search the websites of advocacy groups for specific types of cancer. Many of these websites have lists of clinical trials or refer you to the websites of organizations that match patients to trials. Or, you can contact an advocacy group directly for help finding clinical trials.\nStep 3: Take a Closer Look at the Trials that Interest You\n\n\nOnce you have completed the Cancer Details Checklist and found some trials that interest you, you should now:\n\n\nTake a closer look at the protocol summary for each trial\n\n\tUse the questions below to narrow your list to include only those trials for which you would like to get more information\n Don't worry if you can't answer all of the questions below just yet. The idea is to narrow your list of potential trials, if possible. However, don't give up on trials you're not sure about. You may want to talk with your doctor or another health care team member during this process, especially if you find the protocol summaries hard to understand.\n\n\nKey questions to ask about each trial:\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the main purpose of the trial? Is it to cure your cancer? To slow its growth or spread? To lessen the severity of cancer symptoms or the side effects of treatment? To determine whether a new treatment is safe and well-tolerated? Read this information carefully to learn whether the trial's main objective matches your goals for treatment.\n\n\n\n\nDo the details of your cancer diagnosis and your current overall state of health match the trial's eligibility criteria? Some treatment trials will not accept people who have already been treated for their cancer. Other treatment trials are looking for people who have already been treated for their cancer.\n\n\n If you have just found out that you have cancer, the time to think about joining a trial is before you have any treatment. Talk with your doctor about how quickly you need to make a treatment decision.\n\n\n\n\nIs the location of the trial manageable for you? Some trials take place at more than one location. Look carefully at how often you will need to receive treatment during the course of the trial. Decide how far and how often you are willing to travel. You will also need to ask whether the sponsoring organization will pay for some or all of your travel costs.\n\n\n\n\nHow long will the trial run? Not all protocol summaries provide this information. If they do, consider the time involved and whether it will work for you and your family.\n\n\nAfter thinking about these questions, if you are still interested in a clinical trial, then you are ready to contact the team running the trial.\nStep 4: Contact the Team Running the Trial\n\n\nThere are a few ways to reach the clinical trial team.\n\n\n The protocol summary should include the phone number of a person or an office that you can contact for more information. You do not need to talk to the lead researcher (called the \"protocol chair\" or \"principal investigator\") at this time, even if his or her name is given along with the telephone number. Instead, call the number and ask to speak with the \"trial coordinator.\" This person can answer questions from patients and their doctors. It is also the trial coordinator’s job to decide whether you are likely to be eligible to join the trial. However, a final decision will probably not be made until you have met with a doctor who is part of the trial team.\n\n\tYou will need to refer to the Cancer Details Checklist during this conversation, so keep it handy.\n\n\t\n\n\t The clinical trial coordinator will ask questions about your cancer diagnosis and your current general health that you may not be sure how to answer. So, you may want to ask your doctor or someone else on your health care team to contact the trial coordinator for you.\n\n\t If you have registered to use the website of a clinical trial listing service and found a trial that interests you, the clinical trial team may contact you directly by using the phone number and email address you provide when you register.\nStep 5: Ask Questions\n\n\nWhether you or someone from your health care team speaks with the clinical trial team, this is the time to get answers to questions that will help you decide whether or not to take part in this particular clinical trial. Questions to Ask Your Doctor about Treatment Clinical Trials can help you think about questions you want to ask.\n\n\nRemember to keep your Cancer Details Checklist handy to help you answer some of the questions that may be asked.\n\n\nTalk with Your Doctor\n\n\nTo make a final decision, you will want to know the potential risks and benefits of all treatment options available to you. If you have any remaining questions or concerns, you should discuss them with your doctor. Ask your doctor some of the same questions that you asked the trial coordinator. You should also ask your doctor about the risks and benefits of standard treatment for your cancer. Then, you and your doctor can compare the risks and benefits of standard treatment with those of treatment in a clinical trial. You may decide that joining a trial is your best option, or you may decide not to join a trial. It's your choice.\nStep 6: Make an Appointment\n\n\nIf you decide to join a clinical trial for which you are eligible, schedule a visit with the team running the trial.\n\n\n\n        \n        \n\n    ",

        "text": "Sometimes people with cancer worry about, joke about, or become frustrated by what they describe as mental cloudiness or changes they might notice before, during, and after cancer treatment. This cloudiness or mental change is commonly referred to as chemo brain. Doctors and researchers may call chemo brain many things, such as , , or. The word \"cognitive\" refers to the way your brain works to help you communicate, think, learn, solve problems, and remember. \n \n  What is chemo brain?\n \n  Most define it as a decrease in mental “sharpness” and describe it as being unable to remember certain things and having trouble finishing tasks, concentrating on something, or learning new skills. Even though its exact cause isn’t known, it can happen at any time when you have cancer. \n \n  \n \n  These mental changes can make people unable to perform usual activities like school, work, or social activities. Or it can seem like  it takes a lot of mental effort to do them. Many people don't tell their cancer care team about their problems until it affects their everyday life. It's important to get help and support, so be sure to let your cancer care team know if you notice any mental changes, no matter how small.\n  \n  Here are some examples of what patients with chemo brain may experience:\n \n   \n   Forgetting things that they usually have no trouble remembering (memory lapses)\n \n   Trouble concentrating (they can’t focus on what they’re doing, have a short attention span, may easily “space out”)\n \n   Trouble remembering details like names, dates, and sometimes larger events\n \n   Trouble multi-tasking, like answering the phone while cooking, without losing track of one task (they’re less able to do more than one thing at a time)\n \n   Trouble learning new things\n \n   Taking longer to finish things (disorganized, slower thinking and processing)\n \n   Trouble remembering common words (unable to find the right words to finish a sentence)\n \n  \n \n  For most people, these mental changes only last a short time. Others can have long-term or delayed mental changes.  How long chemo brain lasts is a major factor in how much it affects a person’s life. When it starts, how long it lasts, and how much trouble it causes may be different for every patient. Usually the changes that patients notice are subtle, and others around them might not even notice any changes at all. Still, the people who are having problems are aware of the differences in their thinking.\n    \n  What causes chemo brain?\n \n  Chemo brain is most commonly connected with chemotherapy, but other treatments, such as hormone therapy, radiation, and surgery may be associated with it also. These treatments can cause short-term, long-term, or delayed mental changes or cognitive problems. Beyond the chemo brain symptoms that start during and just after treatment, there are some cases where chemo brain symptoms start and continue after treatment is over. Some people with cancer have very real brain problems even though they haven’t had chemo.\n  \n  Certain things can increase the risk of developing chemo brain or worsening brain function problems. These include:\n \n   \n   The cancer itself, for example brain tumors\n \n   Other drugs used as part of treatment, such as steroids, anti-nausea, or pain medicines\n \n   Other conditions or illnesses, such as diabetes or high blood pressure\n \n   Having other symptoms like tiredness, pain, or sleep problems\n \n   Emotional distress such as depression or anxiety\n \n   Older age\n \n   Being weak or frail\n \n   Surgery and the drugs used during surgery (anesthesia)\n \n   Infection \n \n   Hormone changes or hormone treatments\n \n   Being postmenopausal\n \n   Nutritional deficiencies\n \n   Using alcohol or other substances that can change your mental state\n \n  \n    \n  Most of these cause short-term problems, and get better as the underlying problem is treated or goes away. Others can lead to long-lasting brain problems unless the cause is treated.\n \n  Treatment of chemo brain\n  \n  Treatments for chemo brain may include:\n \n   \n   : This might be part of a cancer rehabilitation (rehab) program. It includes activities to improve brain function such as learning how the brain works and ways to take in new information and performing new tasks; doing some activities over and over that become harder with time; and using tools to help stay organized such as planners or diaries.\n \n   : Exercise can improve your thinking and ability to focus. Activities such as gardening, caring for pets, or walking, can help improve your attention and concentration levels.\n \n   : Meditation can help improve brain function by increasing your focus and awareness.\n \n  \n \n  Talk to your cancer care team about these treatment suggestions and other options they may recommend to help you cope with any cognitive problems.\n \n  Day-to-day coping with chemo brain\n \n  There are some things that you can do to help you sharpen your mental abilities and manage chemo brain. Some examples are:\n \n   \n   . Keeping everything in one place makes it easier to find the reminders you may need. You might want to keep track of appointments and schedules, “to do” lists, important dates, websites, phone numbers and addresses, meeting notes, and even movies you’d like to see or books you’d like to read.\n \n    at the time of they day when you feel your energy levels are the highest.\n \n   . Take a class, do word puzzles, or learn a new language.\n \n   .\n \n   .Regular physical activity is not only good for your body, but also improves your mood, makes you feel more alert, and decreases tiredness (fatigue).\n \n   . Studies have shown that eating more vegetables is linked to keeping brain power as people age.\n \n   . Try to keep the same daily schedule.\n \n    (like keys) and put them there each time.\n \n   . Focus on one thing at a time.\n \n    that might change your mental state and sleeping patterns \n \n   . Friends and loved ones can help with daily tasks to cut down on distractions and help you save mental energy.\n \n   . Keep a diary of when you notice problems and what’s going on at the time. Medicines taken, time of day, and the situation you’re in might help you figure out what affects your memory. Keeping track of when the problems are most noticeable can also help you prepare. You’ll know to avoid planning important conversations or appointments during those times. This record will also be useful when you talk with your doctor about these problems.\n \n   . Accepting the problem will help you deal with it. As many patients have noted, being able to laugh about things you can’t control can help you cope. And remember, you probably notice your problems much more than others do. \n \n  \n \n  Tell others what is happening \n \n  Another thing you can do to better manage chemo brain is tell family, friends, and your cancer care team about it. Finding and getting support is important. Let them know what you’re going through. You may feel relieved once you tell people about the problems you sometimes have with your memory or thinking.\n \n  Chemo brain is a side effect you can learn to manage. Even though this might be a change that’s not easy to see, like other changes such as hair loss or skin changes, your family and friends might have noticed some things and may even have some helpful suggestions. For instance, your partner might notice that when you’re rushed, you have more trouble finding things.\n \n  Tell your friends and family members what they can do to help. Their support and understanding can help you relax and make it easier for you to focus and process information.\n \n  Talk with your doctor or cancer care team\n \n  If brain problems cause trouble at work or school, or interfere with your usual activities, talk with your doctor to try and pinpoint what’s causing your brain fog and what can be done about it. This is especially important for people with chemo brain that lasts longer than the treatment period and keeps causing trouble in their daily lives.\n \n  It helps a lot if you have a diary or log of the situations you have trouble with. It also helps to let your doctor know some of the things that make the problem worse or better. For instance, are they worse in the morning or evening? Do you have more trouble when you are hungry or tired? Does it help to nap, walk, or have a snack? Your doctor will want to know when the problems started and how they affect your daily life.\n \n   \n   Write down questions about the problems you have. Take them to your appointment along with your memory tracking log to talk over with your doctor. Ask what may be causing the problems, and find out if there’s anything the doctor can offer to help you.\n \n   Bring a list of all the medicines you take, including herbs, vitamins, supplements, and those you take on an “as needed” basis.\n \n   Take a friend or family member with you to help you keep track of what’s said during the visit. They can also describe the changes they see if the doctor wants a different viewpoint of how your brain problems are affecting you.\n \n   If your memory and thinking problems keep causing trouble in your daily life, ask your doctor if you might be helped by a specialist such as a neuropsychologist,  speech language pathologist, occupation therapist, or vocational therapist. These professionals can test you and may recommend ways to help you better handle the cognitive problems or changes that you are experiencing. (You may hear this called .)\n \n  \n \n  You may need to visit a larger hospital or cancer care center to find experts on testing brain function, including chemo brain. Ask if you can get a referral to one of these specialists who can help you learn the scope of your problem and work with you on ways to manage it. You’ll want to find out what your insurance will cover before you start.\n \n  Questions to ask about chemo brain\n \n  These are just some of the questions you may want to ask your doctor:\n \n   \n   Based on my treatment, am I at increased risk for brain changes?\n \n   When might these changes happen and how long will they last?\n \n   Are there other medical problems that could be causing my symptoms?\n \n   Is there treatment for my symptoms?\n \n   What can I do to manage chemo brain?\n \n   Is there anything I can do to help prevent or decrease chemo brain symptoms?\n \n   Should I see a specialist? Can you recommend one?\n \n  \n \n  Can chemo brain be prevented?\n \n  So far, there is no known way to prevent the cognitive changes that cause chemo brain. This is because the causes are still being studied. For some people, treating their cancer will mean they might have trouble with thinking, memory, planning, and finding the right words. Chemo brain seems to happen more often in people who get high doses of chemo, and is more likely to happen if the brain is also treated with radiation therapy. \n      \n \n\n\n",

It’s especially important when you are ill, because it can be harder to feel good about yourself when you’re sick.\n \n  Along with routine hygiene, you might want to put extra time and energy into the way you look. Looking your best can help you feel more confident and in control.\n \n  What the patient can do\n \n   \n   Keep up with your regular grooming habits, such as shaving or putting on make-up, and combing your hair, even if you must stay in bed.\n \n   If you’ll need a wig or toupee, see the section called “Hair loss.”\n \n   Pamper yourself. Paint your nails, or buy something that makes you feel good. (Check with your cancer team first, especially before getting manicures, pedicures, or waxing in salons or spas.)\n \n   Nails may start to separate from the nail bed during treatment. Keeping them short so that they don’t catch on things may help.\n \n   Nails may discolor during cancer treatment. Nail polish is usually OK, but check with your cancer team and plan to use a mild (non-acetone based) polish remover. Don’t use artificial or glue-on nails during and for a few months after treatment.\n \n   Use clean tools to gently cut, clean, and file nails. Push cuticles back rather than cutting them.\n \n   Protect hands and nails with household gloves during chores to reduce exposure to soaps and cleaning agents. Use moisturizing creams after hand washing.\n \n   Use an electric razor for routine shaving to prevent nicks and cuts.\n \n   Exercise each day, as much as you can manage comfortably. Ask about an exercise plan. (See the section called “Exercise.”)\n \n   Get enough rest.\n \n   Keep up with regular mouth care. But you should talk with your cancer team before setting up dental cleanings or other procedures during treatment.\n \n  \n \n  What caregivers can do\n \n   \n   When the patient is strong enough, encourage them to go on short outings they enjoy.\n \n   Help the patient keep a supply of their preferred toiletries, lotions, and grooming supplies on hand.\n \n  \n \n   \n \n \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            Written by\n        \n\n    \n        \n            References\n        \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n    \n            \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n            \n\n            The American Cancer Society medical and editorial content team\nOur team is made up of doctors and oncology certified nurses with deep knowledge of cancer care as well as journalists, editors, and translators with extensive experience in medical writing.\n\n        \n\n    \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n            \n        \n\n    \n        \n    \n            \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n        \n            \n            Fauci AS, Braunwald E, Kasper DL, et al (Eds). , 17thed.

        "text": "Coping With Hair Loss\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n \n \n  \nHair is constantly growing, with old hairs falling out and being replaced by new ones. Some cancer treatments make people lose some or all of their hair, most often in clumps during shampooing or brushing.\n \n  It’s normal for both men and women to feel upset about losing their hair. It helps to know that hair grows back, and you can take steps to make its loss less of problem for you.\n \n  Hair is lost when chemotherapy drugs damage hair follicles, making hair fall out. It can be hard to predict which patients will lose their hair and which ones won’t, even when they take the same drugs. Some drugs can cause hair thinning or hair loss only on the scalp. Others can also cause the thinning or loss of pubic hair, arm and leg hair, eyebrows, and eyelashes.\n \n  Radiation therapy to the head often causes scalp hair loss. Sometimes, depending on the dose of radiation to the head, the hair does not grow back the same as it was before.\n \n  If hair loss is going to happen, it most often starts within 1-3 weeks of treatment and becomes more noticeable 1 to 2 months after starting therapy. Your scalp may feel very sensitive to washing, combing, or brushing. But hair often starts to grow back even before treatment ends.\n \n  How to prepare for hair loss\n \n   \n   Each person is different. Ask your health care team if hair loss is likely to happen. If it is, ask if it will happen quickly or gradually.\n \n   If you are going to get chemotherapy that might cause hair loss, talk to your health care team about whether a cooling cap might help reduce your risk. More research is being done to understand how effective and safe cooling caps may be. There are some side effects of cooling caps to consider, such as headaches, scalp pain, and neck and shoulder discomfort. Talk to your health care team about the benefits, limitations, and side effects of cooling caps.\n \n   If the thought of losing your hair bothers you, you might choose to cut your hair very short or even shave your head before it starts falling out.\n \n   If you think you might want a wig, buy it before treatment begins or at the very start of treatment. Ask if the wig can be adjusted – you might need a smaller wig as you lose hair. To match hair color, you can cut a swatch of hair from the top front of your head, where hair is lightest..\n \n   Wigs and other scalp coverings may be partially or fully covered by your health insurance. If so, ask for a prescription for a “cranial prosthesis.” Do not use the word “wig” on the prescription.\n \n   Get a list of wig shops in your area from your cancer team, other patients, or from the phone book. You can also order the American Cancer Society’s “tlc” Tender Loving Care® catalog (for women with hair loss due to cancer treatment) by visiting tlc or by calling 1-800-850-9445.\n \n  \n \n  When you have hair loss\n \n   \n   If you’re going to buy a wig, try on different styles until you find one you really like. Consider buying 2 wigs, one for everyday use and one for special occasions. (See Choosing and Wearing a Wig.)\n \n   Synthetic wigs need less care and styling than human hair wigs. They also cost less and may be easier to manage if your energy is low during cancer treatment.\n \n   Some people find wigs are hot or itchy, and use turbans or scarves instead. Cotton fabrics tend to stay on a smooth scalp better than nylon or polyester.\n \n   If your hair becomes very thin or is completely gone during treatment, be sure to protect the skin on your scalp from heat, cold, and the sun. Use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 30 and a hat. In cold weather, wear a hat or scarf to cover and stay warm.\n \n   Your scalp may feel itchy or sensitive. Be gentle when brushing and washing your hair. Using a wide-toothed comb may help.\n \n   Hair loss might be somewhat reduced by avoiding too much brushing or pulling (which can happen while making braids or ponytails, using rollers, blow drying, or using curling or flat irons).\n \n   Wear a hair net at night, or sleep on a satin pillowcase to keep hair from coming out in clumps. Be gentle with eyelashes and eyebrows, which might also be affected.\n \n   When new hair starts to grow, it may break easily at first. Avoid perms and dyes for the first few months. Keep hair short and easy to style.\n \n   Your new hair may be curlier or straighter, thicker or finer—or even a new color. Usually this change is short term; with time your hair will very likely go back to the way it was before treatment. \n \n  \n \n \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            Written by\n        \n\n    \n        \n            References\n        \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n    \n            \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n            \n\n            The American Cancer Society medical and editorial content team\nOur team is made up of doctors and oncology certified nurses with deep knowledge of cancer care as well as journalists, editors, and translators with extensive experience in medical writing.\n\n        \n\n    \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n            \n        \n\n    \n        \n    \n            \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n        \n            \n            Dest VM.

        "text": "Cooling Caps (Scalp Hypothermia) to Reduce Hair Loss\nWhat is it?\nScalp hypothermia is cooling the scalp with ice packs or cooling caps (cold caps) for a period of time before, during, and after each chemotherapy (chemo) treatment to try to prevent or reduce hair loss.\nNewer versions of these devices use a two-piece cooling cap system that is controlled by a computer, which helps circulate a cooled liquid through a cap a person wears during each chemotherapy treatment. A second cap, made from neoprene (a type of artificial rubber), covers the cooling cap to hold it in place and keep the cold from escaping.\nHow might it work?\nThe theory behind scalp hypothermia is that the cooling tightens up or constricts blood vessels in the scalp. This constriction is thought to reduce the amount of chemo that reaches the cells of the hair follicles. The cold also decreases the activity of the hair follicles and makes them less attractive to chemo, which targets rapidly dividing cells. This could reduce the effect of chemo on the follicle cells and, as a result, prevent or reduce hair loss from the scalp.\nWhat does the research show?\nControlled studies of older forms of scalp hypothermia (such as using ice packs) have had conflicting results. However, some studies of newer, computer-controlled cooling cap systems have shown benefits. Recent studies of women getting chemo for early-stage breast cancer have found that at least half of the women using one of these newer devices lost less than half of their hair. The most common side effects have been headaches, neck and shoulder discomfort, chills, and scalp pain.\nThe success of scalp hypothermia may be related to the type of chemo drugs used, the chemo dosage, and how well the person tolerates the coldness.\nSome research has also suggested that people with a thicker hair layer might be more likely to lose hair than those with a thinner layer of hair. This might be because the scalp doesn’t cool down enough due to the insulating effect of the hair. \nCooling caps that are not fitted tightly have also been linked with more hair loss, often in patches where contact with the scalp is poor.\nThere remain some unanswered questions about the safety of scalp hypothermia. Some doctors are concerned that the cold could keep chemo from reaching any stray cancer cells lurking in the scalp. Some believe that the scalp cooling might protect cancer cells there and allow them to survive the chemo and keep growing. But in people who have used scalp hypothermia, reports of cancer in the scalp have been rare. More studies are needed to answer questions about long-term safety. \nWhat should I do?\nSome newer cooling cap systems, such as the DigniCap and Paxman cooling systems, have been cleared for use by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Some older types of scalp hypothermia devices can be rented or purchased online, and some cancer treatment facilities in the US allow patients to use them.\nIf you are considering whether to use scalp hypothermia, it’s important to carefully weigh the potential benefits, discomforts, and risks . Discuss the pros and cons of this option with your cancer treatment doctor. You might also want to ask if the treatment center has experience in using cooling caps and how successful they have been.\nAnother consideration might be cost. Older types of caps are generally not covered by insurance, and it’s not yet clear if the use of newer, computer-controlled systems will be covered, either. It’s important to check with your insurance company to see what might be covered before starting your treatment.\n\n\n"

        "text": "Choosing a Hat When You've Lost Your Hair\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n \n \n  \nHats can be a safe, comfortable and attractive alternative to wigs and scarves if you have lost your hair due to chemotherapy or other cancer treatment. But choosing the right hat can be daunting. Here are some tips to help. \n \n  Know the facts\n \n  Some people believe that wearing a hat every day may cause hair loss. There is no study that has shown this to be true in cancer patients who have thinning of their hair due to cancer treatments. \n \n  Practical concerns...comfort comes first\n \n   \n   Sometimes scalps are itchy or sensitive when hair is lost because of treatment. Scratchy hats may be uncomfortable, so look for ones with soft cotton linings.\n \n   For hats with liners, wear the liner with the seams facing out, so that only the soft, seamless side touches your scalp.\n \n   For unlined hats (and wigs), adding a soft cap liner will help to make a hat more comfortable, and will help quickly absorb perspiration and wick it away to keep you cool.\n \n  \n \n  Get the right size \n \n   \n   Look for hats with an adjustable size feature.\n \n   If your head is small, consider adding a padded cap liner under your hats. The liner will provide desirable fullness and a snug fit. It will also provide a seamless lining under hats.\n \n   An adhesive hat sizer is another option. This is a band that sticks to the inside of a hat to make the hat fit tighter. For maximum size reduction, 2 sizers can be added to fit all the way around the inside circumference of the hat.\n \n  \n \n  Hats must be deep enough to give adequate coverage\n \n   \n   A deeper cut and a snug fit will prevent gaping at the sides of the hat.\n \n   To best keep a hat in place and to add variety, you might want to wear a headband or scarfband under your hat. A scarfband tied around the crown of a hat is also a pretty touch.\n \n  \n \n  A little bit of hair can make a big difference\n \n   \n   Many women who lose their hair worry about the lack of hair in front of their ears. This bare spot may be especially obvious when wearing glasses. Look for hair accents that can attach with peel-and-stick adhesive backing. These are often made of real hair that can be cut and styled the way you want it.\n \n   Halos are another easy, inexpensive way to get the look of hair while enjoying the comfort of a nice, soft hat. These are wigs that are designed to be worn with hats - they are open at the top to keep you cool all day.\n \n  \n \n  Choose a hat that works with your face and body type.\n \n   \n   Caps and medium brim hats look good on many people.\n \n   If you have a round face, try to avoid rounded crowns. Wear a headband or scarf under your hat so you can angle it, which will add length to your face. Longer earrings and halos also help.\n \n   If your face is longer, wider brims will be more flattering.\n \n   If your jaw line is too strong, emphasize your eyes to draw attention away from it.\n \n   Larger women should avoid small hats that look out of proportion to the shape of their bodies.\n \n   Small women should avoid very large hats that overpower them.\n \n   Don't wear your hat perched on the top of your head. This may look like as though you’re having second thoughts about wearing it at all. It's best to pull it down low on your forehead. \n \n  \n  \n  Fly your \"style\" flag \n \n   \n   Wear your hat with confidence. \n \n   Wear something terrific on your hat. Find a fabulous accessory like a scarf or a feather  or treat yourself to an inexpensive new pin. Costume jewelry can often be found without spending a lot of time or money.\n \n  \n \n  Losing your hair and getting chemo is not pleasant, no matter how you look at it. But hats can add a bit of fun and glamour. You might even find yourself reaching for a hat long after your hair has grown back.\n \n \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            Written by\n        \n\n    \n        \n            References\n        \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n    \n            \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n            \n\n            The American Cancer Society medical and editorial content team\nOur team is made up of doctors and oncology certified nurses with deep knowledge of cancer care as well as journalists, editors, and translators with extensive experience in medical writing.\n\n        \n\n    \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n            \n        \n\n    \n        \n    \n            \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n        \n            \n            Gatherwright J, Liu MT, Amirlak B, Gliniak C, Totonchi A, Guyuron B.

        "text": "How to Wear a Scarf When You've Lost Your Hair\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n \n \n  \nIf you are coping with hair loss, scarves are an attractive and comfortable alternative to wigs and hats. Scarves can be a good investment, too, because they can be used in so many ways after your hair grows back.\n  \n  Choosing a scarf\n \n   \n   Scarves typically come in either a square or oblong style. For a square scarf, look for one that is 35\" or larger. Oblong scarves should be about 21\"x 78\".\n \n   Pre-tied scarves are the easiest to wear. No folding or elaborate tying are required. These typically have soft, covered elastic at the nape to hold them securely and provide full coverage. . Look for one with a gently padded, contoured front to prevent gaping.\n \n   Kerchiefs, similar to bandanas, are another easy alternative for women who are dealing with treatment-related hair loss. They fit just about everyone, and some are lightly padded in the front to prevent gaping and fit just about everyone. Kerchiefs only need to be tied once. When the Kerchief is removed, the knot can be left in, so that retying is unnecessary\n \n   An undercap or headband made with fabric like velvet could help keep scarves of most fabric types from slipping. If desired, a scarf volumizer can be used to help give the illusion of having more hair volume under the scarf and also provide more surface area to help tie the scarf in different styles.\n \n  \n    \n  How to tie a scarf\n \n  Tying scarves is not as hard as it looks, but for security’s sake, it’s a good idea to wear a turban under the scarf until you feel entirely confident about your tying skills. When you are more confident, a headband alone can be used to make tying easier. A padded scarf or hat liner﻿ can also hold your scarf securely, as well as adding fullness.\n \n  For square scarves\n \n  Directions for tying square scarves follow below. All the ways we show start with these simple steps:\n \n   \n   Fold the scarf in half into a triangle\n \n   Put the scarf on your head with the point of the triangle in the back\n \n   Tie the 2 ends of the triangle together in the back of your head over the back part of the triangle.\n \n   Gently turn the scarf, moving the knot from the back to the side of your head. (You can also start out by tying the scarf on the side, rather than in back, if this seems easier.)\n \n  \n \n  Bow style\n \n  First, follow the above steps, then:\n \n   \n   Wrap with an elastic band below the knot.\n \n   Pull some of the scarf through the elastic to give a nice full look.\n \n   Instead of using an elastic band, you can make another knot and then make a bow to create the same effect.\n \n  \n \n  To the side, with a hair tie or \"Scrunchie\"\n \n  First, follow the above steps, then:\n \n   \n   Tie the ends of the scarf together in a knot by putting one end over the other.\n \n   Gently spread the ends for a fuller look.\n \n   Place a hair tie or scrunchie above the knot.\n \n   Pull all the ends of the scarf thorough the hair tie or scrunchie.\n \n   Spread the ends again for a fuller look.\n \n  \n \n  Rosette style (creates the illusion of hair)\n \n  First, follow steps 1-4 above, then:\n \n   \n   Tie a knot by tying one end of the scarf over and under the other.\n \n   Twist the ends together several times and tuck into the top of the knot.\n \n   Gently pull through so that a little of the ends stick out.\n \n   Tuck the ends back into the knot.\n \n   For added security, use a safety pin to hold the rosette together, or pin it to the padded liner.\n \n   You can wear the Rosette to the side or in the back of your head. Either way, it will give the impression of hair. Wear a hat with a brim over this style for another pretty look.\n \n  \n \n  For oblong scarves\n \n  Basic Wrap Style\n \n  Start by folding the width of the scarf in half.\n \n   \n   Place the scarf on your head in the middle of your forehead, above your eyebrows, so that both sides of the scarf hang at equal length.\n \n   Bring both sides of the scarf to the back of your neck. Place the left side over the right so that it overlaps. Then bring both sides to the front of your head and overlap the right one over the left one.\n \n   Bring both sides to the back of your head again. Make a small knot and tuck the ends into the wrap for a neat look.\n \n  \n \n  Double Twist Wrap Style\n \n   \n   Follow Steps 1 and 2 above.\n \n   Bring both sides of the scarf to the back of your neck. Place the left side over the right so that it overlaps. Take one side at a time and start twisting it from the top all the way down to the bottom.\n \n   Take the twisted side and bring it to the front and all around your head to the back. Tuck the scarf end into the wrap. Do exactly the same to the other side of the scarf to get a double twist effect.\n \n  \n \n  Wrap With Rosette\n \n   \n   Follow Steps 1 and 2 above.\n \n   Bring both sides of the scarf to the back of your neck. Place the left side over the right so that it overlaps, and make a knot. Then braid both sides together so you have one long braid.\n \n   To create the rosette, take the braid and wrap it around itself, pulling the end through the knot. For added security, use a safety pin(s) to hold the rosette in place. Wear the rosette to the side or in the back.\n \n  \n \n  Wrap With Twisted Front and Rosette Back\n \n   \n   Follow Steps 1 and 2 above.\n \n   Bring both sides of the scarf to the back of your neck. Place the left side over the right so that it overlaps, and make a knot.\n \n   Gently twist both sides of the scarf and bring them in front on the top of your head. Take one side of the scarf and overlap it with the other side. Then with both sides in your hand, twist them once (one side over the other) so that you create a knot.\n \n   Bring both sides of the scarf around to the back of your head. Tie a small knot. To create the rosette, follow the directions above.\n \n  \n \n \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            Written by\n        \n\n    \n        \n            References\n        \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n    \n            \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n            \n\n            The American Cancer Society medical and editorial content team\nOur team is made up of doctors and oncology certified nurses with deep knowledge of cancer care as well as journalists, editors, and translators with extensive experience in medical writing.\n\n        \n\n    \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n            \n        \n\n    \n        \n    \n            \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n        \n            \n            Nail LM, Lee-Lin F.

        "text": "Choosing and Wearing a Wig\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n \n \n  \nWomen who are faced with hair loss from chemotherapy or radiation treatment often choose at least one wig and then alternate wearing the wig(s) with hats and scarves. Remember, your hair will grow back, although its thickness, texture, and color may not be the same as it was before treatment.\n \n  What should I do to prepare for hair loss?\n \n   \n   Make sure you know if your treatment actually causes hair loss. Not all chemo causes hair loss.\n \n   If your hair is long, consider having it cut short so that switching to a wig or other head covering will be less noticeable.\n \n   Hair generally falls out 2 to 3 weeks after your first chemo treatment.\n \n   Once it starts falling out, consider having your head shaved (use an electric razor to avoid cuts). This can make you feel more in control and keeps you from waking up to find itchy hair all over your pillow.\n \n   If you still need something to catch the hair, you may want to buy a Mesh Cap.\n \n   You may notice that some hair may begin to grow back between treatments, but then fall out again.\n \n  \n \n  Hair usually grows back about six months after chemotherapy ends. Your new hair may be curlier or straighter, thicker or finer—or even a new color. Usually this change is short term; with time your hair will very likely go back to the way it was before treatment.\n \n  Where can I find a wig?\n \n  Search your local area and phone book for wig stores. If you are worried about privacy, ask if the store has one-on-one service available for cancer patients who are choosing a wig. Some may even have a private area for trying on wigs.\n \n  If you have a cancer support group near you, you might want to ask others in the group about places to buy a wig. You can also ask your nurses or a social worker at your treatment center about wig buying options.\n \n  There are also online retailers like \"tlc\n\" that sell wigs and other head covering options.\n \n  Check the wig return policy and your insurance policy:\n \n   \n   Make sure you can return the wig within a reasonable length of time without a restocking fee.\n \n   Check your private insurance policy. With a prescription from your doctor for a “cranial prosthesis” or \"hair prosthesis,\" it may help cover the cost of a wig.\n \n   Unfortunately, Medicare Parts A and B do not cover the cost of wigs for people going through cancer treatment, but they may be a tax-deductible expenses.\n \n  \n \n  If you cannot afford a wig\n  \n  Talk to the nurses or a social worker at your treatment center if there are local organizations or churches that may have wigs that have been donated.\n \n  Choosing a wig\n \n  Before starting treatment\n \n   \n   Take photos of your current hair style.\n \n   Save a lock of hair from the top front of your head, where the hair is lightest, in case you want to match your wig to your present color.\n \n   Use natural light—outdoors or near a window—to decide whether a wig matches the swatch.\n \n   Measure your head with your hair wet or slicked down.\n \n   Make sure your wig is adjustable; your head size may be up to a size smaller when you lose your hair.\n \n  \n \n  Choosing a style\n   \n \n  You have a number of choices of ways to replace your hair. You can go with a full wig, a hair topper, bang attachments or a halo. A hair topper or top piece can add coverage and volume to thinning hair on the top of your head. Halos are designed to wear with a hat or other head cover. They have  hair on the sides, but are open on top to help keep your head cooler.  You can also buy bangs that can be attached to hats, scarves or turbans.\n \n  Natural vs synthetic\n \n  Wigs can be made either of natural human hair, or of synthetic materials. When comparing a high quality synthetic wig, there is not a lot of difference in the look and feel of the hair. The main differences are in cost and maintenance, so choose the type that's right for your needs.\n \n  Synthetic wigs are cheaper, hold their style regardless of the weather, and don't fade over time. But they don't last as long as wigs made of natural hair, and don't have as much flexibility in styling.\n \n  Natural human hair wigs are more expensive and might come in fewer color options, but they can be cut, styled, and dyed just like your own hair. The drawback is that they'll also need more maintenance, will react to weather, and might need restyling or re-dying over time.\n \n  Also consider how long you expect to keep the wig, and whether you would rather have a single wig that lasts a long time, or whether you'd like to change up your look more often with two or more wigs.\n \n  Choosing a color\n \n  The choice of color is a personal one, but be adventurous! Now is your chance to experiment without paying for a long, expensive salon dye job. You might decide to try a wig in a new color and be very pleased with the compliments you receive.\n     \n  Fitting your wig\n \n  When choosing a wig, look for one that's adjustable; your head size may be up to a size smaller when you lose your hair.\n \n   \n   Carefully follow the directions that come with the wig.\n \n   Remove the hair net it comes in, and shake out the wig.\n \n   If you wear glasses, remove them before trying on the wig.\n \n   Holding the wig at the sides, with the woven label in the back, place it at the middle of your forehead and slide it on from front to back. Then adjust the top front of the wig's cap so that it's about 1\" past your natural hairline. The wig won't look natural if it's pulled too far down in front and it should never be placed over your ears.\n \n   The ear tabs should be even and slightly in front of your ears. Push the wire in the tabs towards your face to make the wig lie flat against your head.\n \n   If the wig slides up, you need a larger size.\n \n   If it's too big, roll it up once it's on your head to adjust the back tabs.\n \n  \n \n  Consider getting a cushioned wig grip band to hold the wig securely and comfortably, or a wig liner to make the wig more comfortable to wear. Chemo can make your scalp sensitive, and a wig liner can offer protection, as well as keeping you cooler and more comfortable.\n \n  Styling your wig\n \n   \n   Before styling, always tuck all of the hair behind your ears.\n \n   Bring forward only as much hair as is needed to make the wig look natural.\n \n   If needed, have a hair dresser trim the bangs and thin the wig to make it look more natural.\n \n   On shorter wigs, use a brush as little as possible. Instead, use your fingers and a special wig styling cream, if you like, to create and hold a style.\n \n   To touch up a style, lift the hair with a hair pick, but slip the pick out, instead of pulling all the way through to the end, so that the wig doesn't become too full.\n \n   Before styling long straight wigs, always spray lightly with a wig conditioner and use a wig brush, starting with the ends first.\n \n   For a more natural look, don’t try to have every hair in place.\n \n   Use scarf bands and other hair accessories as you would with your own hair.\n \n  \n \n  Caring for your wig\n \n   \n   To avoid damaging your wig, use only special wig care products.\n \n   Wigs that are worn daily should be washed every 10-14 days, and more often if you're using a lot of hair spray and styling cream.\n \n   Shampoo according to the instructions that come with the wig, towel blot and spray lightly with wig conditioner.\n \n   Allow the wig to dry on a portable wig stand­ so that air can circulate through it­ without rinsing out the conditioner. Wig conditioner build-up is good for wigs. It protects the fiber and extends the life of the wig.\n \n   Keep in mind that wigs, especially those that are synthetic, may take up to 8 to12 hours to dry.\n    \n \n   Wig Lustre, or a similar product, should be used after the wig has been washed several times, to restore its original sheen.\n \n   Wigs should always be stored on a stand, not in a plastic bag or in a box.\n \n  \n \n  Avoid hair dyes and heat\n \n  Synthetic wigs cannot be dyed and should only be shampooed with a wig shampoo. To prevent the glue in the wig from melting, shampoo in cool water and avoid using a blow drier except on the cool setting. Be careful opening the doors of the oven and clothes drier and avoid getting the wig near the burners on the top of the stove.\n \n  No more \"bad hair days!\"\n \n  While losing your hair may be frightening, many women may enjoy trying styles and colors in a wig that they would never have dared to try with their own hair. Some women buy more than one wig and change wigs to suit their mood, their outfit, or the occasion.\n \n  Wigs always look good; there are no more bad hair days. In fact, many women continue to wear their wig(s) after their hair grows back, especially when they don’t have time to get their hair done.\n \n  Give yourself permission to try new colors and styles. You may well bring a smile to your face and to the faces of those who love you. (And you might get some compliments, too!)\n \n \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            Written by\n        \n\n    \n        \n            References\n        \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n    \n            \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n            \n\n            The American Cancer Society medical and editorial content team\nOur team is made up of doctors and oncology certified nurses with deep knowledge of cancer care as well as journalists, editors, and translators with extensive experience in medical writing.\n\n        \n\n    \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n            \n        \n\n    \n        \n    \n            \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n        \n            \n            Medicare.gov.

        "text": "Dry Skin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n \n \n  \n \n   Dry skin can be rough, flaky, red, and sometimes painful. It’s often caused by not having enough oil and water in the layers of the skin. Common causes of dry skin include dehydration, heat, cold, or poor nutrition. In cancer patients, dry skin can be a side effect of cancer treatments like chemotherapy, radiation therapy, targeted therapy, and stem cell transplant. \n \n   What to look for\n \n    \n    Red, rough, flaky skin (although dry skin can look normal)\n \n    Cracks in the skin\n \n    Slight bleeding between the lines of skin covering joints, such as knuckles or elbows\n \n   \n \n   What the patient can do\n \n    \n    Put on moisturizing, alcohol-free creams twice a day, especially after baths.\n \n    Add mineral or baby oil to warm bath water, or put it on after showering while skin is still damp. (This can make you and the floor slippery, so hold onto something when you’re moving around barefoot.)\n \n    Wash with cool or warm water, not hot water.\n \n    Avoid scrubbing the skin during showers or baths. Gently pat skin dry after bathing.\n \n    Avoid colognes, after-shaves, and after-bath splashes that contain alcohol.\n \n    Use an electric razor.\n \n    Drink 2 to 3 quarts of liquid a day, if you’ve been told it’s OK to do this. Ask your cancer care team how much is safe to drink.\n \n    Protect your skin from cold and wind. Avoid hot water and heat, especially dry heat.\n \n    Ask your cancer care team what you can do to help relieve dry skin.\n \n   \n \n   What caregivers can do\n \n    \n    Help the patient put lotions or oils on hard-to-reach places.\n \n    Offer extra fluids.

        "text": "Make-up Tips During Treatment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n \n \n  \nWhen going through cancer treatment, you might see changes in your skin texture or color. Chemotherapy can cause you to lose your hair, including your eyebrows and eyelashes. These changes are usually temporary, but feeling like you don't look like yourself can add extra stress during treatment. \n \n  Trying to look your best might be the last thing on your mind when faced with a cancer diagnosis. But you might also find that learning a few new make-up techniques to help you look more like your normal self helps you feel better and gives you more confidence while going through treatment. Before using any new skin care products, check with your cancer care team, especially if you are still receiving treatment or if you have had a skin reaction. Here are some tips to help.\n \n   \n  If you lose your eyebrows and eyelashes\n \n   \n   Take a good close-up photo of your face before treatment as a guide for applying eyebrows after hair loss, or use an eyebrow stencil.\n \n   Use a soft eyebrow pencil to create eyebrows. For blondes and redheads, a taupe color works well. \n    Then use an angled brush to apply matching brow powder with light, feathery strokes. The pencil helps the powder to last. You can buy a long-handled, angled brush at an arts supply store for a few dollars instead of spending a lot of money on an expensive cosmetic brow brush.\n \n   Line your eyes with a soft eyeliner pencil to give the effect of lashes. Smudge with your finger for a softer look.\n \n  \n \n  For a natural skin tone\n \n   \n   Pat on concealer to hide reddish or dark areas. Then apply a warm tone foundation, blending into your neck for a natural look.\n \n   Use a powder blush for long lasting color, applying blush upwards from cheek to hair line. Use left-over powder on the brush to give a glow to your forehead and chin.\n \n  \n \n  Add color to your lips\n \n   \n   Apply lip balm before outlining and filling in your lips with a lip brush.\n \n   Gently smudge the outline of your upper lip with your finger to give a natural effect.\n \n   Apply a light coat of lip gloss.\n \n  \n   \n  If you have dry skin\n \n   \n   Use an inexpensive moisturizer often on your face, scalp and body to combat dryness.\n \n   You may want to carry a small mister with water and use it several times daily to moisturize your face.\n \n   Use lip balm on your lips.\n"

        "text": "Anxiety\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n \n \n  \nAnxiety means feeling uncomfortable, worried, or scared about a real or possible situation. It's important to recognize anxiety and take steps to manage it or prevent it from getting worse. \n \n  General anxiety\n \n  In general, anxiety is a common problem for patients with a cancer diagnosis. At different times during treatment and recovery, cancer patients and their family and caregivers may feel fearful and anxious. Simply finding a lump or possible other sign or symptom of cancer can cause anxiety and fear, along with finding out that they have cancer or that the cancer has come back. Fear of treatment, doctor visits, and tests might also cause apprehension (the feeling that something bad is going to happen).\n \n  What to look for\n \n  It’s normal to feel afraid when you’re sick. People may be afraid of uncontrolled pain, dying, or what happens after death, including what might happen to loved ones. And, again, these same feelings may be experienced by family members and friends. Signs and symptoms of anxiety include:\n \n   \n   Anxious facial expressions\n \n   Uncontrolled worry\n \n   Trouble solving problems and focusing thoughts\n \n   Muscle tension (the person may also look tense or tight)\n \n   Trembling or shaking\n \n   Restlessness, may feel keyed up or on edge\n \n   Dry mouth\n \n   Irritability or angry outbursts (grouchy or short-tempered)\n \n  \n \n  What the patient and caregiver can do\n \n  Cancer patients and caregivers might have signs and symptoms of anxiety. The signs and symptoms might be more serious if they happen most of the day, nearly every day, and they are interfering with daily activities. In these cases, a referral for  mental health evaluation could be helpful. Keep in mind that sometimes, despite having all the symptoms, a person may deny having these feelings. But if they’re willing to admit that they feel distressed or uncomfortable, therapy can often help.\n  \n   \n   Encourage, but do not force, each other to talk.\n \n   Share feelings and fears that you or the anxious person may be having.\n \n   Listen carefully to each other’s feelings. Offer support, but don’t deny or discount feelings.\n \n   Remember that it’s OK to feel sad and frustrated.\n \n   Get help through counseling and/or support groups.\n \n   Some psychoeducation may help. Psychoeducation combines education with group or individual counseling. \n \n   Mindfulness activities such as yoga may help with focus and is recommended for some levels of anxiety.\n \n   Meditation, prayer, or other types of spiritual support might help.\n \n   Try deep breathing and relaxation exercises. Close your eyes, breathe deeply, focus on each body part and relax it, start with your toes and work up to your head. When relaxed try to think of a pleasant place such as a beach in the morning or a sunny field on a spring day.\n \n   Exercise, from light walking to a regular workout routine, may help lower anxiety.\n \n   Talk with your health care team about using anti-anxiety or anti-depressant medicines.\n \n  \n \n  Things not to do\n \n   \n   Keep feelings inside.\n \n   Force someone to talk if they’re not ready to.\n \n   Blame yourself or another person for feeling fearful or anxious.\n \n   Try to reason with a person whose fears and anxieties are severe; talk with the doctor about medicines and other kinds of help.\n \n  \n \n  Panic attacks\n \n  Panic attacks can be an alarming symptom of anxiety. Panic attacks happen very suddenly and often reach their worst within about 10 minutes. The person may seem fine between attacks, but is usually very afraid that they will happen again.\n \n  What to look for\n \n   \n   Shortness of breath or a feeling of being smothered*\n \n   Racing heart*\n \n   Feeling dizzy, unsteady, lightheaded, or faint*\n \n   Chest pain or discomfort*\n \n   Feeling as if they’re choking*\n \n   Trembling or shaking\n \n   Sweating\n \n   Fear of losing control or “going crazy”\n \n   An urge to escape\n \n   Numbness or tingling sensations\n \n   Feeling “unreal” or “detached” from themselves\n \n   Chills (shaking or shivering) or hot flashes (may involve sweating or facial reddening)\n \n  \n \n  \n \n  If the person has had panic attacks in the past, and it happens again exactly like it did before, they can often recognize it as a panic attack.\n \n  If the person recovers completely within a few minutes and has no more symptoms, it’s more likely to have been a panic attack. If panic attacks are diagnosed by a doctor, brief therapy and medicines have been shown to be helpful.\n \n  Things a caregiver can do\n \n   \n   \n \n   Stay calm and speak softly during a panic attack.\n \n   Sit with the person during panic attacks until he or she is feeling better.\n \n   Call for help if needed.\n \n   After the panic attack is over, encourage the person to get treatment for the panic attacks.\n \n   Provide transportation to treatment if needed. The person may be afraid that a panic attack will happen while driving.\n \n   Things that help a person with anxiety (see above) may also be helpful for someone having a panic attack.\n \n  \n \n  Things not to do\n \n   \n   Minimize or make light of the person’s terror or fear.\n \n   Judge the person for feeling scared and acting strangely.\n \n   Try to talk the person out of their fear or otherfeelings.\n \n  \n  \n \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            Written by\n        \n\n    \n        \n            References\n        \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n    \n            \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n            \n\n            The American Cancer Society medical and editorial content team\nOur team is made up of doctors and oncology certified nurses with deep knowledge of cancer care as well as journalists, editors, and translators with extensive experience in medical writing.\n\n        \n\n    \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n            \n        \n\n    \n        \n    \n            \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n        \n            \n            Dahlin C.

        "text": "Diarrhea\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n \n \n  \nDiarrhea is the passage of loose or watery stools several times a day with or without discomfort. It can happen when water in the bowel (colon or intestine) isn’t being absorbed back into the body for some reason.\n \n  There are many conditions and medications that can cause diarrhea, some that are related to cancer and some that are due to other health problems. Common causes can include chemotherapy, targeted therapy, or immunotherapy treatments, radiation therapy to the pelvic area, and certain medicines. Sometimes there are certain types and locations of tumors that might cause diarrhea. \n \n  Diarrhea can also be caused by things you eat that may not agree with you, such as sugary, spicy, fatty, or fried foods. Other problems that can cause diarrhea are infection, surgery, or liquid food supplements that are concentrated with vitamins, minerals, sugar, and electrolytes.\n \n  Sometimes diarrhea can be caused by an overflow of intestinal liquids around something that’s partly blocking the intestine, such as hard stool or part of a tumor. If hard stool is blocking the intestine, this is called an .\n \n  Depending on the type of treatment being given, diarrhea can start within hours, days, or weeks after receiving chemotherapy, targeted therapy, or immunotherapy. Radiation therapy can also cause diarrhea over a period of time.  Sometimes treatment-related diarrhea can last up to several weeks or months after treatment ends.\n \n  After stomach or bowel surgery, some people may have diarrhea. This might be because parts of the digestive system were removed during surgery, such as part of the intestine or stomach.  Or, it might be because the surgery has caused sensitivity to sweet or high-carbohydrate foods. In these cases, diarrhea can be a long-lasting problem. It's a good idea to avoid gassy foods and carbonated drinks. It's also important to sip fluids during the day to prevent dehydration.\n \n  A weakened immune system due to cancer treatment can cause a higher risk for an infection which may cause diarrhea, too. \n \n  Diarrhea that's not treated or managed well can lead to dehydration and malnutrition.\n \n  What the patient can do\n \n  Ask the cancer care team if diarrhea can be expected after surgery or after getting any type of cancer treatment or new medication. Depending on the cause of diarrhea, some of these tips might be helpful for people with cancer.\n \n   \n   Try a clear liquid diet (one that includes water, weak tea, apple juice, peach or apricot nectar, clear broth, popsicles, and gelatin with no solids added) when diarrhea starts or when you feel that it’s going to start. Avoid acidic drinks, such as tomato juice, citrus juices, and fizzy soft drinks.\n \n   Take medicine for diarrhea only if and as prescribed.\n \n   Track the amount and frequency of bowel movements.\n \n  \n   \n   \n   Include foods that are high in potassium (such as bananas, potatoes, apricots, and sports drinks like Gatorade or Powerade). Potassium is an important mineral that you may lose if you have diarrhea.\n \n   Drink and eat high-sodium (salt) foods like broths, soups, sports drinks, crackers, and pretzels.\n \n   Drink at least 1 cup of liquid after each loose bowel movement. Keep liquids caffeine-free. Try water, sports drinks, or bouillon.\n \n   As diarrhea improves, try eating small amounts of foods that are easy to digest such as rice, bananas, applesauce, yogurt, mashed potatoes, low-fat cottage cheese, and dry toast. \n \n   If diarrhea keeps getting better after a day or 2, start small regular meals.\n \n   Use dampened toilet paper or baby wipes\n     to clean yourself to help soothe the anal area.\n \n   Sitting in a tub of warm water or a sitz bath may help reduce anal discomfort.\n \n   Applying a water-repellent ointment, such as A&D Ointment or petroleum jelly, to the anal area may also help.\n \n   Avoid milk or milk products if they seem to make diarrhea worse. Yogurt and buttermilk are usually OK.\n    \n \n   Avoid pastries, candies, rich desserts, jellies, and preserves.\n \n   Avoid high-fat foods, like fried and greasy foods because they also can make diarrhea worse.\n \n   Don’t drink alcohol or use tobacco.\n \n   Avoid high-fiber foods, which might make diarrhea worse. These include nuts, seeds, whole grains, legumes (beans and peas), dried fruits, and raw fruits and vegetables.\n \n  \n \n   \n   Do not chew sugar-free gum or eat candies and desserts made with sugar alcohol (i.e., sorbitol, mannitol, or xylitol).\n \n  \n \n  What caregivers can do\n \n   \n   See that the patient drinks about 3 quarts of fluids each day.\n \n   Ask the cancer care team how much or how long diarrhea should last before calling to report it.\n \n   Keep a record of bowel movements to help decide when the cancer care team should be called.\n \n   Ask before using any over-the-counter diarrhea medicine.\n \n   Check the anal area for red, scaly, broken skin.\n \n   Protect the bed and chairs from being soiled by putting pads with plastic backing under the patient.\n \n   Encourage room temperature drinks. They might be better tolerated than cold or hot drinks\n \n  \n \n  Call the cancer care team if the patient\n   \n \n   \n   Has loose bowel movements several times a day or for 1 to 4 days, depending on instructions given when treatment starts \n    \n \n   Has blood in the stool or around anal area \n \n   Has a fever of a certain level when taken by mouth, as instructed when treatment starts.\n \n   Has new belly pain or cramps or a swollen belly\n \n   Does not urinate  for 12 hours or more\n \n   Does not drink liquids for 24 hours or more\n \n   Has been constipated for several days and then begins to have small amounts of diarrhea or oozing of liquid stool.\n \n  \n \n \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            Written by\n        \n\n    \n        \n            References\n        \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n    \n            \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n            \n\n            The American Cancer Society medical and editorial content team\nOur team is made up of doctors and oncology certified nurses with deep knowledge of cancer care as well as journalists, editors, and translators with extensive experience in medical writing.\n\n        \n\n    \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n            \n        \n\n    \n        \n    \n            \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n        \n            \n            Abraham, JL.  . 3rd ed.  Baltimore, MD: John Hopkins University Press;2014:449.\nCherny NI, Werman B.

Incontinence can be more than a physical problem. It can disrupt your quality of life if it’s not managed well.\n \n  Fear, anxiety, and anger are common feelings for people dealing with incontinence. You may avoid being intimate or having sex because you are afraid of urine, gas, or stool leakage. Fear of having an accident may keep you from being physically active, enjoying hobbies, or spending extended time outside your home. \n \n  Both men and women can have incontinence during and after surgery or some other treatments for cancer. Incontinence can also occur because of other non-cancer medical conditions. Be sure to talk to your health care team if you have difficulty controlling urination or bowels. Talking about incontinence can be embarrassing, but being open and honest with your health care team can help manage it.\n \n  Bladder incontinence \n \n  Having accidental loss, leaking, or dribbling of urine is called  \n.\n \n  People might describe bladder incontinence as:\n \n   \n   Accidental urine leakage that sometimes can dampens underwear or might be severe enough to saturate clothes\n \n   Having a sense of urgency or unable to \"hold urine\"\n \n   Frequent urination\n \n   Pain or discomfort when urinating\n \n  \n \n  People with cancer, especially those who have certain types of cancer or who are getting certain kinds of treatment, might have  an increased risk for bladder incontinence because of factors such as:  \n \n   \n   Tumor pressure in the spine or near the bladder\n \n   Weakening of the muscles that control the bladder and bowels\n \n   Radiation to the pelvis, abdominal (belly), or genital area\n \n   Certain types of chemotherapy or targeted therapy\n \n   Added pressure on the bladder from constipation or impacted stool (hardened stool that is stuck in the rectum and is difficult to move during a bowel movement) \n \n   Nervous system disorders\n \n   Urinary tract infection (also called or)\n \n   Gastrointestinal tract obstruction (in the bowel or intestine that may also affect the bladder)\n \n   Muscle weakness or lack of activity\n \n   Bladder irritants like caffeine, alcohol, or tobacco\n \n   \n \n  \n \n  \n \n   \n  \n \n  Women and men can also have different risk factors that could lead to this problem.\n \n  Bladder incontinence in women\n \n  Bladder incontinence is more common in women than in men. Other than the possible causes listed above, some things that may increase risk of bladder incontinence in women are:\n \n   \n   Changes to urinary or vaginal tissue from hormone therapy, surgery, chemotherapy, or targeted therapy \n     \n \n   Hormonal changes from menopause\n \n   Pelvic prolapse - the bladder, uterus, and or rectum may slip backward or downward into the vaginal canal because of weak pelvic wall muscles\n \n   Pregnancy\n \n   Vaginal childbirth\n \n   Hysterectomy (surgical removal of the uterus)\n \n  \n \n  Bladder incontinence in men\n \n  Other than the possible causes listed above, some things that may increase risk of bladder incontinence in men are:\n \n   \n   Prostate cancer or surgery\n \n   Having an enlarged prostate (one condition is known as )\n \n  \n \n  Types of bladder (urinary) incontinence\n \n  Not all types of bladder incontinence are the same. The most common types of incontinence are:\n \n  Stress incontinence\n \n  Stress incontinence happens when the muscle that squeezes the urethra to keep urine in the bladder is weak or damaged, if the nerves that help the muscle work have been damaged, or if there have been other changes to the muscle or the tissues around it due to surgery or treatment for cancer. (The urethra is the tube that carries urine from the bladder out of the penis or vagina)\n   . The muscle that squeezes to close it is called the urethral sphincter.\n \n  Stress incontinence may cause you to leak urine when you cough, laugh, sneeze, lift heavy objects, or exercise. You may sleep through the night without having to get up to go to the bathroom, but leak when you get up in the morning. Making a point of going to the bathroom more often is a way to handle stress incontinence. \n \n  Overflow incontinence\n \n  When the bladder has a hard time emptying like it should, and more urine is made than it can hold, it’s called overflow incontinence. Overflow incontinence is usually caused by a blockage or narrowing caused by scar tissue. It also may happen when the bladder muscle can’t squeeze well enough to get all the urine out.\n \n  Signs of overflow incontinence might be getting up often during the night to go to the bathroom, taking a long time to urinate, or having a weak, dribbling stream with little force. You might pass small amounts of urine but not feel empty. Or you may feel like you have to go to the bathroom but cannot. You might leak urine throughout the day.\n \n  Urge incontinence\n \n  Urge incontinence is also called . The bladder muscle contracts (squeezes) too often, usually suddenly and without warning, and you can’t control it. This can be caused by a bladder infection or irritation from radiation therapy.\n \n  In this type of incontinence, even a small amount of urine in the bladder can trigger a strong need to pass urine. Because you can’t hold a normal amount of urine, you go to the bathroom a lot and may wet yourself if you don’t get there right away. You might feel as if you have a weak bladder, or that liquids go right through you. You might even wet the bed at night.\n \n  Managing bladder or urinary incontinence\n \n  Sometimes urinary incontinence can last a short time, depending on what's causing it.  But sometimes incontinence can be long-term and uncomfortable, making some everyday activities difficult to manage.\n \n  Your health care team will ask you questions to determine the type of bladder incontinence you might have. Then, you might need tests to verify the type and learn the cause of it which will help them know the best way to manage it.\n \n   \n    may be recommended. A physical therapist that specializes in pelvic floor muscle exercises (Kegel exercises) can help. This might help muscle strength and bladder control get better by doing exercises that tighten and relax muscles that control the flow of urine.\n \n   canhelp manage how often you need to urinate throughout the day, by assigning certain time intervals to empty your bladder.\n \n  \n   \n   \n    to help the muscles of the bladder and the muscles that control urine flow. Most of these drugs affect either the muscles or the nerves that control them. They work best for urge incontinence.\n \n    may be used to correct long-term incontinence. If there are blockages, they may be removed. Material such as collagen might be recommended and injected to tighten the muscle that controls urine flow.  A small device called a urethral sling can be implanted to press the urethra against the pubic bone. For men, if incontinence doesn't improve, an artificial muscle controlled by a scrotal pump might be an option and implanted to squeeze the urethra.\n \n   , such as pads worn under your clothing, are available to help keep you active and comfortable. Adult briefs and undergarments are bulkier than pads but provide more protection. Bed pads or absorbent mattress covers can also be used to protect the bed linens and mattress. When choosing incontinence products, keep the questions below in mind. Some might not be important to you, or you might have others to add. \n     \n     How much does the product hold or absorb?\n \n     How long will it protect me?\n \n     Can it be seen under my clothing?\n \n     Is it disposable? Reusable?\n \n     How does it feel when I move or sit down?\n \n     Which stores near me carry the products? Are they easy to get?\n \n     How much will it cost? Will my insurance help pay for these products?\n \n    \n \n \n  \n  \n  Bowel incontinence\n \n  Having accidental stool or gas leakage is bowel incontinence (also known as \n). Bowel incontinence can be caused by weak pelvic floor muscles from surgery, other trauma that causes muscle injury, nerve damage, or different medical conditions. People who have bowel incontinence might not have an urge to pass gas or stool, or might not be able to reach the toilet in time. \n \n  People might describe bowel incontinence as:\n \n   \n   Being unable to control gas or stool.\n \n   An urge to move your bowels before it happens.\n \n   Leaking liquid stool or mucus, \nalso known as .\n \n  \n \n  Both men and women with cancer, especially those who have certain types of cancer or who are getting certain kinds of treatment, might have  an increased risk for bowel incontinence because of factors such as:\n \n   \n   Tumor pressure in the spine or near the bladder\n \n   Weakening of the muscles that control the bladder and bowel\n \n   Radiation to the pelvic, abdominal (belly), rectal, or genital area\n \n   Surgery\n \n   \n \n   \n \n   Stress\n \n   Irritable bowel syndrome\n \n   Hemorrhoids\n \n   \n     Rectal prolapse (the rectum, part of the large intestine, protrudes through the anus often because of weak pelvic muscles)\n \n   Diabetes that isn't controlled\n \n   Nervous system disorders like stroke, spinal cord injury, dementia, Parkinson's disease, or multiple sclerosis\n \n   Certain medications, vitamins, or nutritional supplements\n \n  \n \n  For women, a common risk factor for women is vaginal childbirth, which stretches pelvic muscles, tissues in the vagina , and the anal sphincter (this muscle controls the movement of gas and stool in the body).\n \n  Managing bowel incontinence \n \n  \n   \n \n  Testing for bowel incontinence can be done with lab tests, endoscopy, x-ray, MRI, or ultrasound. Doctors may also use muscle strength or nerve testing (bowel function tests) or digital rectal exam. In women, a pelvic exam may be used. Your health care team may also ask about your symptoms, medical history, medication and diet (alcohol or tobacco use, or if certain foods make your incontinence worse).\n \n   \n     (sphincteroplasty) can be used to improve bowel incontinence. It reconnects any anal sphincter tears that may have occurred from vaginal childbirth or from other injuries that may have occurred in a man or woman's genital or urinary area. Other surgery might be done to treat other medical conditions that affect bowel incontinence: hemorrhoids or rectal prolapse.\n \n   can be prescribed by your cancer care team or they may suggest over-the-counter medications like loperamide (Imodium) or bismuth subsalicylate (Pepto-Bismol, Kaopectate) if you have diarrhea. If you are constipated, laxatives, stool softeners, or fiber supplements (Metamucil or Citrucel) may improve your fecal incontinence. If over-the-counter medications don't help your symptoms, your cancer care team may prescribe stronger medications that are commonly used for other bowel conditions (irritable bowel syndrome, Crohn's disease, and ulcerative colitis).\n \n    monitored by a daily food and drink journal can keep track of what type of foods may be causing your symptoms and how to choose different options that may be right for you. Your doctor may refer you to a dietitian or nutritionist as needed.\n \n    is a daily training method that helps regulates your bowel movements by helping you to remember to move your bowels at the same time every day. Trying to eat at the same time every day also helps. You may see an improvement after a few weeks or months.\n \n   may be recommended by a physical therapist that specializes in pelvic floor muscle exercises (Kegel exercises). This type of exercise will help increase muscle strength and bowel and gas control through tightening and relaxing your pelvic area, anus, and rectum.\n \n  \n \n  Living with bowel incontinence\n \n  You can help manage bowel incontinence by following a bowel care plan and using the toilet before you leave home. You can also make sure you carry your medications, supplies, fecal deodorants, and a change of clothes with you.\n \n  Anal discomfort, itching, and irritation can be common. Here are some ways to help manage these symptoms:\n \n   \n   Wash the anal area after a bowel movement or use baby wipes.\n \n   Use a moisture-barrier cream in the anal area.\n \n   Use wick pads or disposable underwear.\n \n   Change soiled underwear frequently to keep the anal area clean and dry.\n \n  \n \n  \n   Living with bowel or bladder incontinence\n \n  There is no single, right way to cope with bladder or bowel incontinence. The challenge is to find what is best for your situation, so you can get the help you need and return to a normal daily life. Talk with your health care team if you notice a change in bowel or bladder habits, and about the best ways to manage incontinence, if it is a problem. You might find it helpful to talk with other people who are dealing with incontinence, too. Ask a member of your cancer care team about support groups in your area.\n \n  Here are some things you can do that may help make incontinence less of a problem:\n  \n   \n   Empty your bladder every 3 to 4 hours while awake, to avoid accidents.\n \n   Empty your bladder before bedtime or before strenuous activity.\n \n   Limit drinks with caffeine, or and avoid alcohol and citrus juices, which can irritate the bladder and make you have to go more often.\n \n   Avoid hygiene products that may irritate you (perfumed soaps, scented lotions, powder, toilet wipes with alcohol) Women should avoid feminine spray or over-the-counter vaginal suppositories.\n \n   Because belly fat can push on the bladder, avoiding weight gain or losing needed weight sometimes helps improve bladder control.\n \n   Avoid tobacco use which can cause coughing and bladder irritation due to harmful substances in tobacco products.\n \n   Talk to your doctor about all medicines, vitamins, herbs, and supplements you’re taking. Some may affect urine control.\n \n  \n   \n  What the caregiver can do\n \n   \n   Encourage or help the patient with appropriate skin care after using the bathroom. Use warm water and pat the area dry.\n \n   Help the patient keep a diary that records specific foods or drinks that may affect how frequently the patient goes to the bathroom.\n \n   Help the patient maintain a bladder or bowel plan.\n \n   Encourage the patient to go to the bathroom at consistent time frames during the day, like after a meal.\n \n   Encourage regular daily exercise, as permitted by the health care team.\n \n  \n \n  Call the cancer care team if the patient\n \n   \n   Has any cramping, discomfort, or pain when going to the bathroom.\n \n   Has any skin changes or irritation such as redness, bleeding, sores, or swelling.\n \n   Has constipation or diarrhea.\n"

        "text": "What Is Cancer?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n \n \n  \nCancer affects 1 in 3 people in the United States. Chances are that you or someone you know has been affected by cancer. Here is some information to help you better understand what cancer is. \n \n  \n   You are made up of trillions of cells that over your lifetime normally grow and divide as needed. When cells are abnormal or get old, they usually die. Cancer  starts when something goes wrong in this process and your cells keep making new cells and the old or abnormal ones don't die when they should. As the cancer cells grow out of control, they can crowd out normal cells. This makes it hard for your body to work the way it should.\n  \n  For many people, cancer can be treated successfully. In fact, more people than ever before lead full lives after cancer treatment.\n  \n  Cancer is more than just one disease\n \n  There are many types of cancer. Cancer can develop anywhere in the body and is named for the part of the body where it started. For instance, breast cancer that starts in the breast is still called breast cancer even if it spreads (metastasizes) to other parts of the body. \n \n  There are two main categories of cancer: \n \n   \n    are cancers of the blood cells, including leukemia, lymphoma, and multiple myeloma. \n \n    are cancers of any of the other body organs or tissues. The most common solid tumors are breast, prostate, lung, and colorectal cancers. \n \n  \n \n  These cancers are alike in some ways, but can be different in the ways they grow, spread, and respond to treatment. \n    Some cancers grow and spread fast. Others grow more slowly. Some are more likely to spread to other parts of the body. Others tend to stay where they started. \n \n  Some types of cancer are best treated with surgery; others respond better to drugs such as chemotherapy. Often 2 or more treatments are used to get the best results.\n       \n  What is a tumor?\n \n  A tumor is a  lump or growth. Some lumps are cancer, but many are not. \n \n   \n   Lumps that are not cancer are called  \n \n   Lumps that are cancer are called \n \n  \n \n  What makes cancer different is that it can spread to other parts of the body while benign tumors do not. Cancer cells can break away from the site where the cancer started. These cells can travel to other parts of the body and end up in the lymph nodes or other body organs causing problems with normal functions.\n   \n  What causes cancer?\n \n  Cancer cells develop because of multiple changes in their genes. These changes can have many possible causes. Lifestyle habits, genes you get from your parents, and being exposed to cancer-causing agents in the environment can all play a role. Many times, there is no obvious cause.\n \n  What  is the cancer stage?\n \n  When a cancer is found, tests are done to see how big the cancer is and whether it has spread from where it started. This is called the cancer's stage. \n \n  A lower stage (such as a stage 1 or 2) means that the cancer has not spread very much. A higher number (such as a stage 3 or 4) means it has spread more. Stage 4 is the highest stage.\n \n  The stage of the cancer is very important in choosing the best treatment for a person. Ask your doctor about your cancer's stage and  what it means for you.\n \n  How does cancer spread?\n \n  Cancer can spread from where it started (the primary site) to other parts of the body.\n \n  When cancer cells break away from a tumor, they can travel to other areas of the body through either the bloodstream or the lymph system. Cancer cells can travel through the bloodstream to reach distant organs. If they travel through the lymph system, the cancer cells may end up in lymph nodes. Either way, most of the escaped cancer cells die or are killed before they can start growing somewhere else. But one or two might settle in a new area, begin to grow, and form new tumors. This spread of cancer to a new part of the body is called .\n \n  In order for cancer cells to spread to new parts of the body, they have to go through several changes. They first have to become able to break away from the original tumor and then attach to the outside wall of a lymph vessel or blood vessel. Then they must move through the vessel wall to flow with the blood or lymph to a new organ or lymph node.\n"

        "text": "Adjusting to Life with Cancer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n \n \n  \nA diagnosis of cancer impacts many parts of your life – whether you have just found out you have cancer, are getting treated, or have finished treatment. You likely feel both physical and emotional changes which can impact the way you feel and how you live.\n \n  These changes may affect daily life, but there are ways to cope.\n \n  Dealing with a cancer diagnosis\n \n  When you learn you have cancer, you may feel like your life has been turned upside down. It can seem overwhelming at first, but knowing what to expect may help you feel more at ease.\n \n  Once the shock of learning you have cancer wears off, the process of making changes begins. You may have to rearrange things in your life as you start treatment. You may have to learn new ways of talking to your loved ones and to your health care team. And you probably have a lot of questions to ask about dealing with all the new issues that cancer brings. The following tips can help.\n \n  Get in touch with your feelings\n \n  Just as cancer affects your physical health, it can bring up a wide range of feelings you’re not used to. Having cancer can also make many feelings seem more intense. These feelings may change daily, hourly, or even minute to minute. This is true whether you’re currently in treatment, done with treatment, or ﻿the friend or family member of someone with cancer. .\n \n  Learn how to recognize the wide range of emotions you could be experiencing, including:\n \n   \n   Feeling overwhelmed\n \n   Denial\n \n   Anger\n \n   Fear and worry\n \n   Hope\n \n   Sadness and depression\n \n   Stress and anxiety\n \n  \n \n  Tell your friends and family and let them help\n \n  Talking about your cancer can help you deal with all of the new emotions you are feeling. Consider letting your family and friends know about your diagnosis. It may affect them as much as you. The people in your life may also feel worried, angry, or afraid.\n \n  Once people learn of your cancer, some will ask you how they can help. Others will wonder what they can do for you but won't be sure how to ask you. You can help your friends cope with the news by letting them help you in some way. For example, ask them to drive your carpool or go to the store. Make a list of things you think you might need help with, so they can pick something they’re able to do for you.\n \n  Know when to seek professional help\n \n  If you have feelings that overwhelm or concern you, or that go on for more than 2 weeks, talk to your health care team. Some of these symptoms may include:\n \n   \n   Feelings of sadness that don’t go away\n \n   Feelings of helplessness or hopelessness, as if life has no meaning\n \n   A short temper, or feeling moody\n \n   A hard time thinking or concentrating\n \n   No interest in the hobbies and activities you used to enjoy\n \n   Sleep problems\n \n   A racing heart\n \n   Fatigue that doesn’t go away\n \n  \n \n  Call your health care team right away if you have thoughts about hurting or killing yourself.\n \n  Tips for coping\n \n  There are many ways to deal with your emotions. Follow these tips to help you cope:\n \n   \n   Talk about your feelings, no matter what they are.\n \n   Stay active and eat balanced meals.\n \n   Treat yourself to things you enjoy, like a hot bath, a nap, or your favorite foods.\n \n   Go to a movie, out to dinner, or to a game.\n \n   Get help with everyday jobs like cooking and cleaning.\n \n   Don’t try to do it all yourself.\n \n   Don’t try to force yourself to be happy.\n \n   Don’t try to do too much in one day.\n \n   Don’t give up healthy habits.\n \n  \n \n  Learn more coping skills in our checklist for patients.\n \n  Adjusting to a “new normal”\n \n  Those who have gone through cancer treatment describe the first few months as a time of change. It’s not so much “getting back to normal” as it is finding out what’s normal for you now. People often say that life has new meaning or that they look at things differently. Your new normal may include:\n \n   \n   Changes in the way you eat and the things you do\n \n   New or different sources of financial, social, or emotional support\n \n   Needing help doing things you used to do without problems\n \n   ﻿Permanent scars on your body\n \n   Emotional scars from going through so much\n \n  \n \n  You may see yourself in a different way or find that others think of you differently now. Whatever your new normal may be, give yourself time to adapt to the changes. Take it one day at a time.\n \n  Dealing with the fear of recurrence\n \n  When your treatment is finished, you’re probably happy to be done so you can get back to how things used to be. At the same time, you may feel sad and worried. It’s very common to think about whether the cancer will come back and what happens now. \n \n  Fear about cancer coming back is the most common emotional challenge people face after cancer.\n \n  Cancer recurrence is defined as when cancer comes back after you finish treatment and cancer has not been found in your body for a while. Usually doctors call it a recurrence if there have been no signs of cancer for a year or more. The cancer may come back in the same place it first started, or it may appear somewhere else in the body. \n \n  You may have questions about the possibility of recurrence, such as:\n \n   \n   Will there ever be a time when I’ll be sure my cancer won’t come back?\n \n   What should I look for if I am worried about a recurrence?\n \n   What symptoms should I report to my health care team that might mean the cancer is back? \n \n   What can I do to lower the chance my cancer will come back?\n \n   What other health problems am I at risk for after my cancer treatment?\n \n  \n \n  It’s normal to worry about the cancer coming back, especially during the first year after treatment. Survivors may become concerned that any new symptom could mean that the cancer has come back. It may help to keep a diary of symptoms to discuss at your next follow-up visit. And ask what the next steps are in your cancer follow-up care. \n \n  And know that although many people say their fear of cancer returning fades over time, things like follow-up visits, anniversary events, or the illness of a family member can make you worry about your health. This is normal and a good time to seek support. \n"

        "text": "Self-Management: Take Control of Your Health\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n \n \n  \nCancer is a complicated disease requiring specialized treatments and often involving a complex team of doctors and caregivers. Your personal journey with cancer and the challenges you have or will face along the way are unique. These challenges can be from the cancer, the side effects of treatments, making decisions about your treatment, dealing with treatment staff, and from the impact cancer has on your life. It can feel overwhelming. If you are feeling this way, you are not alone.\n \n  Your health care team has the knowledge and experience to help you. But keep reminding yourself that YOU are the expert on your own health. There are many active steps you can take to get the most out of your treatments and reduce the impact of side effects on your life. Using these steps to take back some of the control of your care and your life can go a long way toward improving your day-to-day life.\n \n  This kind of self-management may seem like a new idea, but you already do this every day, whether it’s your choices for fitting exercise into your day or getting to bed on time. Taking control of your health by doing small things each day will add up to make a big difference in how you feel.\n \n  Here are some steps to help you improve your self-management skills:\n \n  5 steps for better self-management\n \n  Step 1: identify your goals\n \n  Step back and think about the sorts of things that are causing you the most problems. Is it a symptom of cancer? A side effect of treatment? Something happening in your life outside of cancer treatment? Choose 2-3 challenges you want to work on and then identify the goals that will help you manage them. Make your goals specific. Think about where you want to be in a few weeks. For example, you may want to improve the quality of your sleep or you may want to eat better and exercise more to lessen the tiredness you’ve been having.\n \n  Step 2: create a plan\n \n  Now that you have goals to work on, think through where you want to start and what steps you want to take to achieve your goals. Each goal should have its own plan. Most goals will require more than one step to get to where you want to be. Start simple and build from there. For example, if you want to be more active, start with short walks or add 5 minutes to your exercise plan. Then increase that slowly until you get to your goal. \n \n  Step 3: identify potential challenges\n \n  No matter how solid a plan is, there will almost always be unexpected challenges that will make it harder to reach your goals. Think about what sorts of problems and potential challenges might throw you off track. Then make a strategy for how to overcome them. For example, if your goal is to exercise more and your plan is to take a 20-minute walk every day, how will you deal with bad weather? Maybe your solution to this challenge would be to go for a walk in a large indoor space, like at the mall.\n \n  Step 4: monitor your progress\n \n  Monitoring your progress helps you to see what is working well and where you might need to make a few changes. Even though this is a key step in getting more control over cancer’s impact on your life, many of us forget to do this. Write down your goals and track your progress. When you get stuck, make a note and keep trying.. Try setting a consistent time during the day to check in with yourself and keeping track of your progress in a journal, chart, or on your calendar or phone.\n \n  Step 5: re-assess the plan\n \n  Look at what you have been tracking. How is it going? Ask yourself, what has worked well and what other steps might get you closer to your goal? Think about how you might want to change your plan or goals to keep moving forward. Talk to your health care team or your family and friends about your plans and your progress.\n \n  Taking back some of control of your life from cancer is not easy. Using these 5 steps, communicating with your health care team, and asking for support from the important people in your life are all ways that can help you improve your health.\n"

        "text": "Benefits of good nutrition during cancer treatment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n \n \n  \nWhen you’re healthy, eating enough food to get the nutrients and calories you need is not usually a problem. Most nutrition guidelines stress eating lots of vegetables, fruits, and whole-grain products; limiting the amount of red meat you eat, especially meats that are processed or high in fat; cutting back on fat, sugar, alcohol, and salt; and staying at a healthy weight. But when you’re being treated for cancer, these things can be hard to do, especially if you have side effects or just don’t feel well.\n \n  Good nutrition is especially important if you have cancer because both the illness and its treatments can change the way you eat.   They can also affect the way your body tolerates certain foods and uses nutrients. \n \n  During cancer treatment you might need to change your diet to help build up your strength and withstand the effects of the cancer and its treatment. This may mean eating things that aren’t normally recommended when you are in good health. For instance, you might need high-fat, high-calorie foods to keep up your weight, or thick, cool foods like ice cream or milk shakes because sores in your mouth and throat are making it hard to eat anything. The type of cancer, your treatment, and any side effects you have must be considered when trying to figure out the best ways to get the nutrition your body needs.\n \n  The nutrition needs of people with cancer vary from person to person. Your cancer care team can help you identify your nutrition goals and plan ways to help you meet them. Eating well while you’re being treated for cancer might help you:\n \n   \n   Feel better.\n \n   Keep up your strength and energy.\n \n   Maintain your weight and your body’s store of nutrients.\n \n   Better tolerate treatment-related side effects.\n \n   Lower your risk of infection.\n \n   Heal and recover faster.\n \n  \n \n  Eating well means eating a variety of foods to get the nutrients your body needs to fight cancer. These nutrients include proteins, fats, carbohydrates,  water, vitamins, and minerals.\n  \n  Proteins\n \n  We need protein for growth, to repair body tissue, and to keep our immune systems healthy. When your body doesn’t get enough protein, it might break down muscle for the fuel it needs. This makes it take longer to recover from illness and can lower resistance to infection. People with cancer often need more protein than usual. After surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation therapy, extra protein is usually needed to heal tissues and help fight infection.\n \n  Good sources of protein include fish, poultry, lean red meat, eggs, low-fat dairy products, nuts and nut butters, dried beans, peas and lentils, and soy foods.\n \n  Fats\n \n  Fats play an important role in nutrition. Fats and oils serve as a rich source of energy for the body. The body breaks down fats and uses them to store energy, insulate body tissues, and transport some types of vitamins through the blood.\n \n  You may have heard that some fats are better for you than others. When considering the effects of fats on your heart and cholesterol level, choose  (olive, canola, and peanut oils) and  fats (these are found mainly in safflower, sunflower, corn, and flaxseed oils and seafood) more often than saturated fats or trans fats.\n   \n   are mainly found in animal sources like meat and poultry, whole or reduced-fat milk, cheese, and butter. Some vegetable oils like coconut, palm kernel oil, and palm oil are saturated. Saturated fats can raise cholesterol and increase your risk for heart disease. Less than 10% of your calories should come from saturated fat.\n \n  Sources of  include snack foods and baked goods made with partially hydrogenated vegetable oil or vegetable shortening. Trans fats are also found naturally in some animal products, like dairy products. Trans fats can raise bad cholesterol and lower good cholesterol. Avoid trans fats as much as you can.\n \n  Carbohydrates\n \n  Carbohydrates are the body’s major source of energy. Carbohydrates give the body the fuel it needs for physical activity and proper organ function. The best sources of carbohydrates – fruits, vegetables, and whole grains – also supply needed vitamins and minerals, fiber, and phytonutrients to the body’s cells. (Phytonutrients are chemicals in plant-based foods that we don’t need to live, but that might promote health.)\n  \n  Fiber is the part of plant foods that the body can’t digest. There are 2 types of fiber. Insoluble fiber helps to move food waste out of the body quickly, and soluble fiber binds with water in the stool to help keep stool soft.\n \n  Other sources of carbohydrates include bread, potatoes, rice, spaghetti, pasta, cereals, corn, peas, and beans. Sweets (desserts, candy, and drinks with sugar) can supply carbohydrates, but provide very little in the way of vitamins, minerals, or phytonutrients.\n \n  Water\n \n  Water and liquids or fluids are vital to health. All body cells need water to function. If you don’t take in enough fluids or if you lose fluids through vomiting or diarrhea, you can become dehydrated (your body doesn’t have as much fluid as it should). If this happens, the fluids and minerals that help keep your body working can become dangerously out of balance. You get water from the foods you eat, but a person should also drink about \n   eight 8-ounce glasses of liquid each day to be sure that all the body cells get the fluid they need. You may need extra fluids if you’re vomiting, have diarrhea, or even if you’re just not eating much. Keep in mind that all liquids (soups, milk, even ice cream and gelatin) count toward your fluid goals.\n \n  Vitamins and minerals\n \n  Your body needs vitamins and minerals to help it function properly and use the energy (calories) in food. Most are found naturally in foods, but they are also sold as pill and liquid supplements.   \n \n  If you eat a balanced diet with enough calories and protein you will usually get plenty of vitamins and minerals. But it can be hard to eat a balanced diet when you’re being treated for cancer, especially if you have treatment side effects. If you do have side effects, your doctor or dietitian may suggest a daily multivitamin and mineral supplement. If your food intake has been limited for several weeks or months because of the effects of treatment, be sure to tell your doctor. You might need to be checked for vitamin or mineral deficiencies.\n \n  If you’re thinking of taking a supplement, be sure to discuss this with your doctor first. Some people with cancer take large amounts of vitamins, minerals, and other dietary supplements to try to boost their immune system or even destroy cancer cells. But some of these substances can be harmful, especially when taken in large doses. In fact, large doses of some vitamins and minerals may make chemotherapy and radiation therapy less effective.\n \n  If your doctor says it’s OK for you to take a vitamin during treatment, it may be best to choose a supplement with no more than 100% of the Daily Value (DV) of vitamins and minerals and one without iron (unless your doctor thinks you need iron).\n \n  Antioxidants\n \n  Antioxidants include vitamins A, C, and E; selenium and zinc; and some enzymes that absorb and attach to free radicals (destructive molecules)\n    , preventing them from attacking normal cells.\n \n  If you want to take in more antioxidants, health experts recommend eating a variety of fruits and vegetables, which are good sources of antioxidants. Taking large doses of antioxidant supplements or vitamin-enhanced foods or liquids is usually not recommended while getting chemo or radiation therapy. Talk with your doctor to find out the best time to take antioxidant supplements.\n \n  Phytonutrients\n \n  Phytonutrients or phytochemicals are plant compounds like carotenoids, lycopene, resveratrol, and phytosterols that are thought to have health-protecting qualities. They’re found in plants such as fruits and vegetables, or things made from plants, like tofu or tea. Phytochemicals are best taken in by eating the foods that contain them rather than taking supplements or pills.\n \n  Herbs\n \n  Herbs have been used to treat disease for hundreds of years, with mixed results. Today, herbs are found in many products, like pills, liquid extracts, teas, and ointments. Many of these products are harmless and safe to use, but others can cause harmful side effects. Some may even interfere with proven cancer treatments and recovery from surgery. If you’re interested in using products containing herbs, talk about it with your oncologist or nurse first.\n \n  Dietary supplementsafety considerations\n \n  Many people believe that  a pill or supplement they find in stores, is safe and it works. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has rules to help ensure that supplements contain what their labels claim they do, but the supplement’s safety and its effects on the body are not addressed by any FDA rules. The FDA does not make manufacturers of these products print possible side effects on their labels. And the FDA can’t pull a dietary supplement or herbal product from the market unless they have proof that the product is unsafe.\n \n  It’s also been shown that many herbal products aren’t what the label says they are. Some products don’t contain any of the herb they’re supposed to. Some also contain potentially harmful drugs, additives, or contaminants that aren’t listed on the label. This means there’s no sure way to know if a supplement is safe or how it will affect you.\n \n  Tell your cancer care team about any over-the-counter products or supplements you‘re using or are thinking about using. Take the bottle(s) to your doctor to talk about the dose and be sure that the ingredients do not interfere with your health or cancer treatments. Some other safety tips:\n \n   \n   Ask your cancer care team for reliable information on dietary supplements.\n \n   Check the product labels for both the quantity and concentration of active ingredients in each product.\n \n   Stop taking the product and call your cancer care team right away if you have side effects, like wheezing, itching, numbness, or tingling in your limbs.\n"

        "text": "Cancer affects 1 in 3 people in the United States. Chances are that you or someone you know has been affected by cancer. Here is some information to help you better understand what cancer is. \n \n  \n   You are made up of trillions of cells that over your lifetime normally grow and divide as needed. When cells are abnormal or get old, they usually die. Cancer  starts when something goes wrong in this process and your cells keep making new cells and the old or abnormal ones don't die when they should. As the cancer cells grow out of control, they can crowd out normal cells. This makes it hard for your body to work the way it should.\n  \n  For many people, cancer can be treated successfully. In fact, more people than ever before lead full lives after cancer treatment.\n  \n  Cancer is more than just one disease\n \n  There are many types of cancer. Cancer can develop anywhere in the body and is named for the part of the body where it started. For instance, breast cancer that starts in the breast is still called breast cancer even if it spreads (metastasizes) to other parts of the body. \n \n  There are two main categories of cancer: \n \n   \n    are cancers of the blood cells, including leukemia, lymphoma, and multiple myeloma. \n \n    are cancers of any of the other body organs or tissues. The most common solid tumors are breast, prostate, lung, and colorectal cancers. \n \n  \n \n  These cancers are alike in some ways, but can be different in the ways they grow, spread, and respond to treatment. \n    Some cancers grow and spread fast. Others grow more slowly. Some are more likely to spread to other parts of the body. Others tend to stay where they started. \n \n  Some types of cancer are best treated with surgery; others respond better to drugs such as chemotherapy. Often 2 or more treatments are used to get the best results.\n       \n  What is a tumor?\n \n  A tumor is a  lump or growth. Some lumps are cancer, but many are not. \n \n   \n   Lumps that are not cancer are called  \n \n   Lumps that are cancer are called \n \n  \n \n  What makes cancer different is that it can spread to other parts of the body while benign tumors do not. Cancer cells can break away from the site where the cancer started. These cells can travel to other parts of the body and end up in the lymph nodes or other body organs causing problems with normal functions.\n   \n  What causes cancer?\n \n  Cancer cells develop because of multiple changes in their genes. These changes can have many possible causes. Lifestyle habits, genes you get from your parents, and being exposed to cancer-causing agents in the environment can all play a role. Many times, there is no obvious cause.\n \n  What  is the cancer stage?\n \n  When a cancer is found, tests are done to see how big the cancer is and whether it has spread from where it started. This is called the cancer's stage. \n \n  A lower stage (such as a stage 1 or 2) means that the cancer has not spread very much. A higher number (such as a stage 3 or 4) means it has spread more. Stage 4 is the highest stage.\n \n  The stage of the cancer is very important in choosing the best treatment for a person. Ask your doctor about your cancer's stage and  what it means for you.\n \n  How does cancer spread?\n \n  Cancer can spread from where it started (the primary site) to other parts of the body.\n \n  When cancer cells break away from a tumor, they can travel to other areas of the body through either the bloodstream or the lymph system. Cancer cells can travel through the bloodstream to reach distant organs. If they travel through the lymph system, the cancer cells may end up in lymph nodes. Either way, most of the escaped cancer cells die or are killed before they can start growing somewhere else. But one or two might settle in a new area, begin to grow, and form new tumors. This spread of cancer to a new part of the body is called .\n \n  In order for cancer cells to spread to new parts of the body, they have to go through several changes. They first have to become able to break away from the original tumor and then attach to the outside wall of a lymph vessel or blood vessel. Then they must move through the vessel wall to flow with the blood or lymph to a new organ or lymph node.\n",

        "text": "Telling Others About Your Cancer\nFinding out you have cancer can be overwhelming for you as well as friends and family. People often don’t know what to say. They may feel sad and uncomfortable and might be afraid of upsetting you. They might be frightened about the possibility of losing you. Sometimes people find it easier to say nothing because they’re afraid of saying the wrong thing. Some people find it easy to talk, while others may become overly careful or act too cheerful.\nHow do you feel about it?\nYou most likely will have many different emotions as you learn more about your diagnosis and begin to learn about treatment options. It’s normal to wonder, “Why me?” or to feel sad, angry, or afraid. Physical and chemical changes from the treatment or the cancer itself can also affect your emotions. The first step is to admit to yourself how you feel. It’s OK to let yourself feel the way you do.\nGetting ready to talk to others\nOnly you can decide when to tell your friends and family you have cancer. People are very sobered by the news that someone has cancer. Most people need and want to talk to someone when they find themselves in this kind of situation. It may be even more important for single people without supportive family members nearby to let close friends know what’s happening. Think ahead so you can tell them what they can do when they ask how they can help – people who live alone often have a few extra needs compared to those who live with others.\nSometimes, telling those closest to you helps you take in the reality of what’s happening. Some people find that by talking, they begin to solve problems and think about other issues as their family and friends ask questions.\nThink about how much you want to share. You might want to explain what kind of cancer you have, which treatments you might need, and your outlook (or prognosis). As you talk with others, you may want to write down the questions that come up so that you can discuss them with your cancer care team.\nDeciding who to tell\nIt could be helpful to start by making a list of people that you want to talk to in person. Then you can make another list of friends that you socialize with less often and have another friend or family member contact them with the news.\nPeople usually tell their spouse or partner first, then other family and close friends. It’s also important to tell your children, which might require more preparation depending on their ages. Learn more in Helping Children When a Family Member Has Cancer: Dealing With Diagnosis.\nIf you work, think about whether you want to let your co-workers know what’s going on and how much they need to know. Co-workers and acquaintances often find out later, although sometimes you’ll need to tell a supervisor or someone in Human Resources that you have a medical problem if you’ll need to take time off. Different people require different levels of information.\nIf you do decide to tell co-workers, you can start by talking with and getting ideas from someone you trust at work. Some people tell co-workers in a group via a carefully planned email or brief statement in a meeting, so that everyone starts with a basic understanding of what’s happening. There is no one right answer for everyone – it depends on your preferences and the culture at your workplace. For more on this, see Working During Cancer Treatment.\nHow to talk to others about your cancer\nIn general, tell the people close to you how you’re feeling. This is sometimes hard to do, but it’s healthy to let others know about your sadness, anxiety, anger, or other emotional distress. If you don’t feel comfortable doing this, you may want to find a support group or a mental health counselor to help you. Your support group or counselor will be there for you at a regular time set aside for you to focus on and talk about your concerns and issues. Some people prefer workshops, peer groups, or religious support.\nFind what works for you\nTry different things until you find what works for you. When you keep other people involved and informed about your illness, it helps ease your burden. Friends and family can share their strength and concern with you and with each other, which can be helpful for everyone involved.\nIf you or your family normally don’t like to talk about certain personal issues, remember that it’s OK not to open up to everyone. Some people are very careful about who they talk with and what they talk about. This might be a good time, though, for you to start to work on becoming more open with trusted loved ones.\nGiving details\nIt could get tiring telling a lot of people details about your illness over and over again. You can always suggest that they call or visit our website to learn more for themselves, or to find out how they can best help you.\nThere are also special websites such as CaringBridge designed for cancer patients and families to help them keep friends and family updated without having to talk on the phone for hours about what’s going on. These sites typically let you decide who’s able to see your updates – you can make them public, or limit access to only the people you invite. If you’re unable to set it up yourself, ask for help from a trusted friend or family member who knows about these kinds of sites and tools. Some people send group emails, text messages, or tweets to let friends know when there are changes or updates. Some websites will even send out emails or texts for you. This can save many phone calls and yet keep the information coming for the caring or even the just curious.\nLearn your “trigger” points\nThink about your ‘‘trigger points” or topics that are too sensitive for you to talk about yet. Do you get angry when people question your choice of treatments? Maybe this is a topic you’ll have to avoid. Does it annoy you when people bring religion into it, saying things like, “God never gives you more than you can handle?” Think about the things that people have said or could say that bother you. Then, plan a response that’s comfortable for you and cuts off the conversation. And once you’ve shared what you wish to share, be prepared to change to another topic. Maybe you can say something like “I really get tired of talking about cancer. Let’s talk about something else.”\nAsk how they feel about it\nTry to encourage loved ones to talk to you about how they’re feeling so you can work through questions together. You can say, “How are  doing? Can you believe this?” This gives your friend or family member permission to talk with you about their feelings. But if you’re not ready to hear about their fears and worries, don’t ask. It can be tough enough to manage your treatment and figure out how you feel without worrying about others. It takes effort and emotional work that you may not have the energy for. But if you want to foster openness, this is one way to do so.\nSometimes you may  want to talk about how you feel or about how others feel. You can gently tell others this just by saying something like, “You know, usually I am OK talking about things like this, but today I just can’t handle it. I’m sure you understand.” This way you set your own boundaries about when and under what circumstances you are able to discuss your illness.\nWhen others want to help\nOne of the first things a friend or family member often says is “What can I do to help?” You might be tempted to say, “Oh, nothing right now. We’re just fine.” Maybe you don’t really know what you need, want your privacy, or feel you have all you can handle without having more people around you. Remember that most people really do want to help, and you’ll probably need extra help at some point during your cancer treatment.\nBe as specific as possible about the kind of help you need. For example, tell them when you need a ride to the doctor, or find out if they might be able to help with housecleaning, yard work, or child care. There will be times when you don’t know what you need, but even just saying that will be helpful. It also gives them a chance to offer something they can do for you.\nWhen people say unhelpful things\nTell you to cheer up\nYou may have friends or family members who tell you to “cheer up” when you talk to them about your sadness, worries, or fears. It’s OK to ask them gently if they’d be willing just to listen, without judgment or giving advice (unless you ask for it). It’s important for your mental health that you find someone you can talk to. Don’t allow yourself to be discouraged by people who are uncomfortable with your feelings. Some people are unable to listen, not because of you, but because of their own experiences or their own sadness. That has nothing to do with you. You may have to accept that this person may not be the best one for you to talk to. Look for others who can handle it better.\nAsk questions you don’t want to answer\nYou may find that sometimes you are pressed to answer questions about your cancer when you don’t feel like it. To avoid this, you might want to ask a family member or friend to be your spokesperson. It can be emotionally exhausting to repeat the details of your illness to everyone who’s concerned about you. Having a spokesperson keeps you from having to do this, but keeps loved ones up to date without wearing you out.\nIn some cases, your cancer illness may be “big news” in your community. Often, people are truly concerned but really don’t know you very well. Of course, there are also people who are just curious.\nCancer is very personal and you need to be comfortable with how much you share with people who just want to know what’s happening. You may have to think about ways to tell people that you don’t want to talk about your personal business. In many cases, “Thank you for asking, but I’d rather not talk about it right now” is enough to make people understand, but sometimes you may have to be more direct. “I’d prefer not to go into details” or “I don’t want to get into my private health issues” may be needed. Think about how you want to handle curious questions from people you don’t know. Try to prepare a response that works for you.\nBring up cancer unexpectedly\nSometimes people will try to comfort you on a day when you are feeling especially angry. Or a person may come up to you and start talking about your cancer when you’re trying to focus on your child’s play at school. Maybe someone you barely recognize stops you in the grocery store with the sad story of her father’s cancer. You really don’t want to hear their story, but you know they’re just trying to be nice or relate to you. How can you stop them politely? Sometimes you just have to take a couple of deep breaths and say calmly, “Thank you so much for your concern, but I need to focus on something else today.” Remember, it’s always your decision about whether or not you choose to discuss it.\nBecome impatient or angry with you\nSometimes those close to you may become angry too. Just as you’re going through many different emotions, those around you may be going through the same kinds of feelings. Most people will feel angry at some point, but try to keep in mind that family and friends are angry with the situation –  with you. You’re probably going through exactly the same thing at times.\nYou may hear, “You aren’t doing the things you used to do.” Children, and even some adults, can be extremely self-centered. Your social, family, and work roles will change as you begin to focus on treatment and healing. Your energy levels will be low at times and you may not be able to do all that you had been doing. You will adjust more easily if you explain this to those around you and share your reactions to the different changes taking place in your life. Talk to your family about how tasks can still be done even though you won’t be able to do all of them yourself.\nKeep life as normal as possible\nAs much as you can, allow yourself and your family members to keep life as normal as possible while you’re getting treatment. Encourage your family to keep doing the things they always did without feeling guilty (enjoying hobbies, playing sports, exercising, spending time with friends, and so on). Children, especially, benefit from the routine, but adults also find that it offers them an anchor for day-to-day life.\nWhat not to do\nDon’t ignore or neglect a friend or relative who may need to open up and talk with you.\nDon’t ignore your own need to talk with someone.\nDon’t set up a false front, or a “happy face,” if you don’t really feel that way. While you might tend to try to protect your loved ones by acting as cheerful as possible, it will help you and them more if you share your true feelings.\nfeel that there’s a perfect way to talk or handle your interactions with others. You’ll find that there are times when you feel great about talking and sharing, and other times when you feel that communication is not going very well. Realize that you – and others – are doing the best you can most of the time. And that’s good enough.\nWhen to call the doctor\nSometimes you’ll have physical side effects from your treatment that may mean you need help from your cancer care team. Learn more about the physical symptoms and side effects of cancer treatment, and when you should get help with them in the “Treatments” section of our website Talk to you doctor, nurse, or social worker if you have any concerns that seem too much to manage on your own. Also be sure that you know who to call or how to get help outside of normal office hours and on weekends or holidays.\nFor some people, having cancer and going through the stress it brings can start to make it seem that life isn’t worthwhile. Please talk to your doctor or nurse right away if you have thoughts about hurting yourself. Cancer and cancer treatment can be hard to get through, and lots of people need extra help and support.\n"

        "text": "Eating Well During Treatment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n \n \n  \nTry to eat well. A healthy diethelps your body  function at its best. This is even more important if you have cancer. You’ll go into treatment with reserves to help keep up your strength, your energy level, and your defenses against infection. A healthy diet can also prevent body tissue from breaking down and build new tissues. People who eat well are better able to cope with side effects of treatment. And you may even be able to handle higher doses of certain drugs. In fact, some cancer treatments work better in people who are well-nourished and are getting enough calories and protein. Try these tips:\n \n   \n   Don’t be afraid to try new foods. Some things you never have liked before might taste good during treatment.\n \n   Choose different plant-based foods. Try eating beans and peas instead of meat at a few meals each week.\n \n   Try to eat more fruits and vegetables every day, including citrus fruits and dark-green and deep-yellow vegetables. Colorful vegetables and fruits and plant-based foods have many natural health-promoting substances.\n    \n \n   Try to stay at a healthy weight, and stay physically active. Small weight changes during treatment are normal.\n \n   Limit the amount of salt-cured, smoked, and pickled foods you eat.\n \n   Limit or avoid red or processed meats\n     \n \n  \n \n  If you can’t do any of the above during this time, don’t worry about it. Help is available if or when you need it. Tell your cancer care team about any problems you have. Sometimes diet changes are needed to get the extra fluids, protein, and calories you need.\n \n  Snack as needed\n \n  During cancer treatment your body often needs extra calories and protein to help you maintain your weight and heal as quickly as possible. If you’re losing weight, snacks can help you meet those needs, keep up your strength and energy level, and help you feel better. During treatment you may have to rely on snacks that are less healthy sources of calories to meet your needs. Keep in mind that this is just for a short while – once side effects go away you can return to a healthier diet. Try these tips to make it easier to add snacks to your daily routine:\n \n   \n   Eat small snacks throughout the day.\n \n   Keep a variety of protein-rich snacks on hand that are easy to prepare and eat. These include yogurt, cereal and milk, half a sandwich, a bowl of hearty soup, and cheese and crackers.\n \n   Avoid snacks that might make any treatment-related side effects worse. If you have diarrhea, for example, avoid popcorn and raw fruits and vegetables. If you have a sore throat, do not eat dry, coarse snacks or acidic foods.\n \n  \n \n  If you’re able to eat normally and maintain your weight without snacks, then don’t include them.\n \n  Some quick-and-easy snacks\n   \n \n   \n   Cereal (hot or cold)\n \n   Cheese (aged or hard cheese, cottage cheese, cream cheese, and more)\n \n   Cookies\n \n   Crackers\n \n   Dips made with cheese, beans, yogurt, or peanut butter\n \n   Fruit (fresh, frozen, canned, dried)\n \n   Gelatin made with juice, milk, or fruit\n \n   Granola or trail mix\n \n   Homemade milk shakes and smoothies\n \n   Ice cream, sherbet, and frozen yogurt\n \n   Juices\n \n   Microwave snacks\n \n   Milk by itself, flavored, or with instant breakfast powder\n \n   Muffins\n \n   Nuts, seeds, and nut butters\n \n   Popcorn, pretzels\n \n   Puddings, custards\n \n   Sandwiches (such as egg salad, grilled cheese, or peanut butter)\n \n   Soups\n \n   Sports drinks\n \n   Vegetables (raw or cooked) with olive oil, dressing, or sauce\n \n   Yogurt (low fat or Greek)\n \n  \n \n  Tips to get more calories and protein\n \n   \n   Eat several small snacks throughout the day, rather than 3 large meals.\n \n   Eat your favorite foods at any time of the day. For instance, eat breakfast foods for dinner if they appeal to you.\n \n   Eat every few hours. Don’t wait until you feel hungry.\n \n   Eat your biggest meal when you feel hungriest. For example, if you are most hungry in the morning, make breakfast your biggest meal.\n \n   Try to eat high-calorie, high-protein foods at each meal and snack.\n \n   Exercise lightly or take a walk before meals to increase your appetite.\n \n   Drink high-calorie, high-protein beverages like milk shakes and canned liquid supplements.\n \n   Drink most of your fluids between meals instead of with meals. Drinking fluid with meals can make you feel too full.\n \n   Try homemade or commercially prepared nutrition bars and puddings.\n \n  \n \n  High-protein foods*\n \n  \n \n   \n   Eat cheese on toast or with crackers.\n \n   Add grated cheese to baked potatoes, vegetables, soups, noodles, meat, and fruit.\n \n   Use milk in place of water for hot cereal and soups.\n \n   Include cream or cheese sauces on vegetables and pasta.\n \n   Add powdered milk to cream soups, mashed potatoes, puddings, and casseroles.\n \n   Add Greek yogurt, powdered whey protein, or cottage cheese to favorite fruits or blended smoothies.\n \n  \n \n  \n \n   \n   Keep hard-cooked eggs in the refrigerator. Chop and add to salads, casseroles, soups, and vegetables. Make a quick egg salad.\n \n   All eggs should be well-cooked to avoid the risk of harmful bacteria.\n \n   Pasteurized egg substitute is a low-fat alternative to regular eggs.\n \n  \n \n  \n \n   \n   Add cooked meats to soups, casseroles, salads, and omelets.\n \n   Mix diced or flaked cooked meat with sour cream and spices to make dip.\n \n  \n \n  \n \n   \n   Sprinkle seeds or nuts on desserts like fruit, ice cream, pudding, and custard. Also serve on vegetables, salads, and pasta.\n \n   Spread peanut or almond butter on toast and fruit or blend in a milk shake.\n \n  \n \n  High-calorie foods*\n \n  \n \n   \n   Melt over potatoes, rice, pasta, and cooked vegetables.\n \n   Stir melted butter into soups and casseroles and spread on bread before adding other ingredients to your sandwich.\n \n  \n \n  \n \n   \n   Add whipping or heavy cream to desserts, pancakes, waffles, fruit, and hot chocolate; fold it into soups and casseroles.\n \n   Add sour cream to baked potatoes and vegetables.\n \n  \n \n  \n \n   \n   Use regular (not low-fat or diet) mayonnaise and salad dressing on sandwiches and as dips with vegetables and fruit.\n \n  \n \n  \n \n   \n   Add jelly and honey to bread and crackers.\n \n   Add jam to fruit.\n \n   Use ice cream as a topping on cake.\n \n  \n \n   \n  Don’t forget about physical activity\n \n  Physical activity has many benefits. It helps you maintain muscle mass, strength, stamina, and bone strength. It can help reduce depression, stress, fatigue, nausea, and constipation. It can also improve your appetite. So, if you don’t already exercise, talk to your doctor about aiming for at least 150 to 300 minutes of moderate activity, like walking, each week. If your doctor approves, start small (maybe 5 to 10 minutes each day) and as you are able, work up to the goal of 300 minutes a week. Listen to your body, and rest when you need to. Now is not the time to push yourself to exercise. Do what you can when you’re up to it.\n   \n"

        "text": "Food Safety During Cancer Treatment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n \n \n  \n \n   Cancer and its treatment can weaken your body’s immune system by affecting the blood cells that protect us against disease and germs. As a result, your body can’t fight infection and disease as well as a healthy person’s body can.\n \n   During your treatment for cancer, there will be times when your body won’t be able to defend itself very well. This is because you might not have enough infection-fighting white blood cells for a while. You may be told to try to avoid exposure to possible infection-causing germs. It's important to know that you can't raise your white blood cell counts by avoiding or eating certain kinds of foods. But here are some tips for handling, planning, and preparing food when your immune system is recovering:\n \n   Food-handling tips\n \n    \n    Wash your hands with warm, soapy water for 20 seconds before and after preparing food and before eating.\n \n    Refrigerate foods at or below 40° F.\n \n    Keep hot foods hot (warmer than 140° F) and cold foods cold (cooler than 40° F).\n \n    Thaw meat, fish, or poultry in the microwave or refrigerator in a dish to catch drips. Do not thaw at room temperature.\n \n    Use defrosted foods right away, and do not refreeze them.\n \n    Put perishable foods in the refrigerator within 2 hours of buying or preparing them. Egg dishes and cream- and mayonnaise-based foods should not be left unrefrigerated for more than an hour.\n \n    Wash fruits and vegetables well under running water before peeling or cutting. Do not use soaps, detergents, chlorine bleach solutions, or commercial produce rinses. Using a clean vegetable scrubber, scrub produce that has a thick, rough skin or rind (melons, potatoes, bananas, etc.) or any produce that has dirt on it.\n \n    Rinse leaves of leafy vegetables one at a time under running water.\n \n    Rinse packaged salads, slaw mixes, and other prepared produce again under running water, even when marked pre-washed. Using a colander can make this easier.\n \n    Do not eat raw vegetable sprouts.\n \n    Throw away slimy or moldy fruits and vegetables.\n \n    Do not buy produce that already has been cut at the grocery store (like melon or cabbage).\n \n    Wash tops of canned foods with soap and water before opening.\n \n    Use different utensils for stirring foods and tasting them while cooking. Do not taste the food (or allow others to taste it) with any utensil that will be put back into the food.\n \n    Throw away eggs with cracked shells.\n \n    Throw out foods that look or smell strange. Never taste them!\n \n   \n \n   Do not cross-contaminate\n \n    \n    Use a clean knife to cut different foods.\n \n    In the refrigerator, store raw meat sealed and away from ready-to-eat food.\n \n    Keep foods separated on the countertops. Use a different cutting board for raw meats.\n \n    Clean counters and cutting boards with hot, soapy water, or you can use a fresh solution made of 1 part bleach and 10 parts water. Moist disinfecting wipes may be used if they’re made for use around food.\n \n    When grilling, always use a clean plate for the cooked meat.\n \n   \n \n   Cook foods well\n \n    \n    Put a meat thermometer into the middle of the thickest part of the food to test for doneness. Test a thermometer’s accuracy by putting it into boiling water. It should read 212° F.\n \n    Cook meat until it’s no longer pink and the juices run clear. The only way to know for sure that meat has been cooked to the right temperature is to use a food thermometer. Meats should be cooked to 160° F and poultry to 180° F.\n \n   \n \n   Microwave cooking\n \n    \n    Rotate the dish a quarter turn once or twice during cooking if there’s no turntable in the microwave oven. This helps prevent cold spots in food where bacteria can survive.\n \n    Use a lid or vented plastic wrap to thoroughly heat leftovers. Stir often during reheating.\n \n   \n \n   Grocery shopping\n \n    \n    Check “sell-by” and “use-by” dates. Do not buy products ( including meats, poultry, or seafoods) that are out of date. Pick only the freshest products. \n      \n \n    Do not use damaged, swollen, rusted, or deeply dented cans. Be sure that packaged and boxed foods are properly sealed.\n \n    Choose unblemished fruits and vegetables.\n \n    Do not eat deli foods.

There are other health problems that might be managed by eating low-fiber foods, too. \n \n   What is a low-fiber diet?\n \n   A low-fiber diet means you eat foods that do not have a lot of fiber.\n \n   If you have certain medical problems, you may be asked to reduce the amount of fiber in your diet to rest your bowels (or intestines). A low-fiber diet reduces the amount of undigested food moving through your bowels, so that your body makes a smaller amount of stool. A low-fiber diet may be suggested after some types of surgery or if you have diarrhea, cramping, or trouble digesting food. \n \n   There are 2 kinds of fiber, soluble and insoluble. Insoluble fiber doesn’t dissolve in the stomach and can have rough hard bits that irritate the intestines as it passes through. Soluble fiber attracts water into the intestines and becomes a gel. Foods with a little soluble fiber can often be eaten in small amounts (depending on why you’re on a low-fiber diet) because the soft fiber gel doesn’t irritate the intestines the same way.\n \n   What are low-fiber foods?\n \n   If your doctor tells you to follow a low-fiber diet, here are low-fiber foods you can eat and higher-fiber foods you should avoid. Remember to always choose foods that you would normally eat. Do not try any foods that caused you discomfort or allergic reactions in the past.\n \n   If you are on a “low-residue diet,” your food choices are even more restricted than those listed below.\n \n   \n \n   Meat, fish, poultry, and protein\n \n   Eat\n \n    \n    Tender cuts of meat\n \n    Ground meat\n \n    Tofu\n \n    Fish and shellfish\n \n    Smooth peanut butter\n \n    Eggs\n \n   \n \n   Bake, broil, or poach meats, and use mild seasonings. Try preparing meats as stews, roasts, meatloaves, casseroles, sandwiches, and soups using ingredients on the approved lists.\n \n   Scramble, poach, or boil eggs; or make omelets, soufflés, custard, puddings, and casseroles, using ingredients noted below. You might want to ask your doctor, nurse, or dietitian about other foods may be OK for you to eat, and find out when you can go back to your normal diet.\n \n   Avoid\n \n    \n    All beans, nuts, peas, lentils, and legumes\n \n    Processed meats, hot dogs, sausage, and cold cuts\n \n    Tough meats with gristle\n \n   \n \n   Dairy: Milk and cheese\n \n   Eat\n \n   Only in small to medium amounts and only if they don’t cause problems for you\n \n    \n    Milk, chocolate milk, buttermilk, and milk drinks\n \n    Yogurt without seeds or granola\n \n    Sour cream\n \n    Cheese\n \n    Cottage cheese\n \n    Custard or pudding\n \n    Ice cream or frozen desserts (without nuts)\n \n    Cream sauces, soups, and casseroles\n \n   \n \n   You can use these items in desserts, snacks, or breads.\n \n   Bread, cereals, and grains\n \n   Eat\n \n    \n    White breads, waffles, French toast, plain white rolls, or white bread toast\n \n    Pretzels\n \n    Plain pasta or noodles\n \n    White rice\n \n    Crackers, zwieback, melba, and matzoh (no cracked wheat or whole grains)\n \n    Cereals without whole grains, added fiber, seeds, raisins, or other dried fruit\n \n   \n \n   Use white flour for baking and making sauces.

Here are some problems you could have depending on the type of treatment you receive:\n \n  Surgery\n \n  After surgery, you will need extra calories and protein for wound healing and recovery. This is when many people have pain and feel tired. They also may be unable to eat a normal diet because of surgery-related side effects. Your body’s ability to use nutrients may also be changed by surgery on any part of the digestive tract (like the mouth, esophagus, stomach, small intestine, pancreas, colon, or rectum).\n \n  Be sure to talk to your cancer care team about any problems you’re having so they can help you manage them.\n \n  For suggestions on coping with treatment side effects, see Managing Cancer-related Side Effects\n \n  For more about information on surgery as a cancer treatment, see Cancer Surgery.\n \n  Radiation therapy\n \n  The type of side effects radiation causes depends on the area of the body being treated, the size of the area being treated, the type and total dose of radiation, and the number of treatments.\n \n  Side effects usually start around the second or third week of treatment and peak about two-thirds of the way through treatment. After radiation ends, most side effects last 3 or 4 weeks, but some may last much longer.\n \n  If you’re having trouble eating and have been following a special eating plan for diabetes or another chronic health condition, some of these general tips may not work for you. Talk to your cancer care team about how best to change your eating habits while you’re getting radiation.\n \n  Tell your cancer care team about any side effects you have so they can prescribe any needed medicines. For example, there are medicines to control nausea and vomiting and to treat diarrhea.\n \n  See How Radiation Therapy Can Affect Different Parts of the Body for more information on its side effects.\n \n  Chemotherapy\n \n  Chemotherapy (chemo) side effects depend on what kind of chemo drugs you take and how you take them.\n \n  Chemo is often given at an outpatient center. It may take anywhere from a few minutes to many hours. Make sure you eat something beforehand. Most people find that a light meal or snack an hour or so before chemo works best. If you’ll be there several hours, plan ahead and bring a small meal or snack in an insulated bag or cooler. Find out if there’s a refrigerator or microwave you can use.\n \n  Some side effects of chemo go away within hours of getting treatment. If side effects last longer, tell your cancer care team. There are things you can do to lessen eating-related side effects. And prompt attention to eating-related side effects can help keep up your weight and energy level and help you feel better.\n \n  If you’re having trouble eating and have been following a special eating plan for diabetes or some other chronic health condition, talk to your cancer care team about how best to change your eating habits while getting chemo.\n \n  Here are some of the more common problems and tips on how to deal with them.

People with a very low appetite that lasts more than a few days usually lose weight. Losing weight from not eating enough can often make a person feel weak and have fatigue. This may affect their quality of life and ability to do usual activities. It can also affect how they respond to cancer treatments. \n \n  What causes loss of appetite?\n \n  People with cancer might have many factors that affect their appetite, most commonly it's the cancer itself and treatment for the cancer.  \n \n  Cancer itself can cause a loss of appetite for the following reasons.\n \n   \n   If a tumor is in or around parts of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, it might interfere with the intake of food\n     , may cause trouble swallowing, or make a person feel full without even eating. \n \n   Some tumors release certain types of hormones that affect how the body recognizes that it's hungry. \n \n   Things like pain, stress, depression, dehydration, and nausea that might be related to the cancer itself can reduce a person's appetite.\n \n  \n \n  Surgery and other cancer treatment-related side effects can cause loss of appetite. Some of the side effects that can affect appetite include:\n \n   \n   Changes in taste or smell\n \n   Pain\n \n   Nausea or vomiting\n \n   Constipation or diarrhea\n \n  \n \n  It's important to remember that other non-cancer health problems and medications used to treat non-cancer problems can also cause loss of appetite.\n   \n  What to look for\n \n  A person that has anorexia (poor appetite or no appetite) may eat much less than normal or may not eat at all. This is common with some cancers and some treatments, but it's important to remember that everyone is different. If treatment is the main cause, loss of appetite can be temporary. If there are other factors, it can be longer lasting. \n \n   \n   Little or no interest in food\n \n   Refusing to eat favorite foods\n \n   \n \n  \n \n  When the loss of appetite leads to poor nutrition and a significant loss of weight and muscle mass, it is called . When cachexia happens in people with advanced cancer, some experts call this . CACS can lead to low levels of some nutrients, such as protein and certain vitamins and minerals that can be life-threatening. A person that has cachexia may look very thin. But, if they were overweight or obese before having cancer, they may just look like they've lost some weight. For this reason, sometimes blood tests are used to find out if someone has cachexia.\n \n  What the patient can do\n \n  Eating as well as you can is an important way a person with cancer can help to take care of themselves. It's important to talk to the cancer care team about any expected appetite changes before surgery for cancer, or before other types of treatment are started. Reporting appetite changes early can help limit problems from losing too much weight and having poor nutrition. \n \n  Here are some hints that may help if you are having changes in your appetite:\n \n   \n   Eat several small meals or snacks throughout the day, rather than 3 large meals.\n \n   Avoid drinking liquids with meals, or take only small sips of liquids while eating to keep from feeling full early (unless you need liquids to help swallow or for dry mouth). But remember it's important to stay hydrated, so it might be best to drink most of your liquids between meals.\n \n   Make eating more enjoyable by setting the table with pretty dishes, playing your favorite music, watching TV, or eating with someone.\n \n   Be as physically active as you can. Start off slowly, and increase your activity over time as you feel stronger. Sometimes a short walk an hour or so before meals can help you feel hungry.\n \n   Keep high-calorie, high-protein snacks on hand. Try hard-cooked eggs, peanut butter, cheese, ice cream, granola bars, liquid nutritional supplements, puddings, nuts, canned tuna or chicken, or trail mix. (See the table of high-protein foods in Eating Well During Treatment.)\n \n   Review the tips on adding calories and protein to foods and include these in meals and snacks throughout the day.\n \n   Eat your favorite foods any time of the day; for instance, if you like breakfast foods, you can eat them for dinner.\n \n  \n \n  What caregivers can do\n \n   \n   Try giving the patient 6 to 8 small meals and snacks each day.\n \n   Offer starchy foods, such as bread, pasta, or potatoes, with high-protein foods, such as fish, chicken, meats, turkey, eggs, cheeses, milk, tofu, nuts, peanut butter, yogurt, peas, and beans.\n \n   Keep cool drinks and juices within the patient’s reach.\n \n   If the smell of food bothers the patient, serve bland foods cold or at room temperature.\n \n   Create pleasant settings for meals, and eat with the patient.\n \n   Offer fruit smoothies, milkshakes, or liquid meals when the patient doesn’t want to eat.\n \n   Try plastic forks and knives instead of metal if the patient is bothered by bitter or metallic tastes.\n \n   Don’t blame yourself if the patient refuses food or can’t eat.\n \n   Be encouraging, but try not to nag or fight about eating.\n \n   If the patient can’t eat, you might want to offer just your company. Or offer to read to them or give them a massage.\n \n  \n \n  Call the cancer team if the patient\n \n   \n   Feels nauseated and can’t eat at all for a day or more\n \n   Loses 3 pounds or more in a week (or less than a week)\n     \n \n   Has pain when eating\n \n   Doesn’t urinate for an entire day or doesn’t move bowels for 2 days or more\n \n   Doesn’t urinate often, and when they do, it comes out in small amounts, smells strong, or is dark colored\n \n   Vomits for more than 24 hours\n \n   Is unable to drink or keep down liquids\n \n   Has pain that’s not controlled\n"

        "text": "Swallowing Problems\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n \n \n  \nCancer and its treatments can sometimes have effects that cause a person trouble with swallowing. It may be a short-term side effect of certain treatments, such as chemotherapy or radiation to the throat or chest. It may also be caused by mouth sores, an infection of the mouth or esophagus (the swallowing tube that goes from the throat to the stomach), or other problems. Trouble swallowing, or difficult swallowing is called . \n   \n  What causes swallowing problems?\n \n  Swallowing problems can be caused by different health problems, including certain types of cancer. There can be problems with motor function, meaning messages sent from the brain aren't getting to the esophagus to tell it to swallow. This can be caused by a problem in the brain or nervous system, such as a stroke, nervous system disorder, neuropathy, or tumor affecting the brain. Or, there can be something blocking food or fluids during swallowing, such as a large clump of food, foreign object, a narrowing of the esophagus, or a tumor in or pressing on the esophagus.\n \n  People with cancer may have swallowing problems because of side effects of certain treatments. For example, people who have mouth sores (mucositis) due to chemotherapy, targeted therapy, or radiation therapy to the head and neck may have pain when swallowing. Many people who are getting radiation therapy to the head and neck area also have dry mouth due to reduced saliva which can make swallowing difficult.\n \n  Other problems, such as having too much saliva, hiccups, heartburn, and indigestion can also make swallowing difficult at times. \n \n  What to look for\n \n   \n   Gagging, coughing, or vomiting of food as you try to swallow\n \n   \n \n   Drooling or the sense you have too much saliva (spit)\n \n   Little or no saliva\n \n   Inside of mouth is red, shiny, glossy, or swollen\n \n   Open sores in the mouth\n \n   Pain in throat or mid-chest when you swallow\n \n   Feeling as if food is “sticking” on its way down\n \n   White patches or a coating on the inside of the mouth\n \n  \n \n  What the patient can do\n \n   \n   Eat bland foods that are soft and smooth but high in calories and protein (such as cream-based soups, pudding, ice cream, yogurt, and milkshakes).\n \n   Take small bites, and swallow each bite completely before taking another.\n \n   Use a straw for liquids and soft foods.\n \n   Try thicker liquids (such as fruit that has been pureed in the blender or liquids with added thickeners), because they’re easier to swallow than thin liquids.\n \n   Mash or puree foods (such as meats, cereals, and fresh fruits) so that they’re as soft as baby food. You might need to add liquids to dry foods before blending.\n \n   Dunk breads in milk to soften.\n \n   Refrigerate food (the cold helps numb pain) or serve cool or lukewarm. If pain gets worse with cold foods, try them at room temperature.\n \n   Try crushed ice and liquids at meals.\n \n   Frequent small meals and snacks may be easier to manage.\n \n   Crush pills or tablets and mix in juice, applesauce, jelly, or pudding. (Check with your nurse or pharmacist first, because some pills can be dangerous if crushed or broken. Others react badly with certain foods or must be taken on an empty stomach.)\n \n   Avoid alcohol and hot, spicy foods or liquids.\n \n   Avoid acidic foods, such as citrus fruits and drinks and fizzy soft drinks.\n \n   Avoid hard, dry foods such as crackers, pretzels, nuts, and chips.\n \n   Sit upright to eat and drink, and stay that way for a few minutes after meals.\n \n   If you gag, cough, spit, feel pain or have other problems swallowing, try eating soft or liquid foods. You might be able to swallow thick fluids more easily than thin liquids. If you can't to eat enough regular foods to meet your nutritional needs, drink high-calorie and high-protein liquids. \n \n   If mouth pain is a problem, use a numbing gel or pain reliever, such as viscous lidocaine (by prescription) or ask about taking pain medicine before eating. (See Mouth Sores.)\n \n   Ask about seeing a speech-language pathologist or swallowing therapist. These are health professionals who can teach you how to swallow better and how to decrease coughing and choking when you eat and drink.\n \n  \n \n  To make foods easier to swallow, try these thickeners\n \n   \n   Use to help soften cakes, cookies, crackers, sandwiches, pureed fruits, and other cold food. Mix 1 tablespoon unflavored gelatin in 2 cups hot liquid until dissolved; pour over food. Let food sit until saturated.\n \n   Use to thicken liquids. Note that these must be cooked before using.\n \n   Follow label instructions, and use to adjust a liquid’s thickness\n \n   Use in soups. Note that these change the food’s flavor.\n \n   Use to make a very thick product.\n \n   If thin liquids are recommended for you, try these: coffee, tea, soft drinks, liquid nutritional supplements, Italian ice, sherbet, broth, and thin cream-based soups.\n \n   If thick liquids are recommended for you, try these: buttermilk, eggnog, milk shakes, yogurt shakes, and ice cream.\n \n  \n \n  What caregivers can do\n \n   \n   Offer soft, moist foods. Baked egg dishes, tuna salads, and thick liquids such as yogurt may be easier to swallow.\n \n   Offer soft desserts that don't require much chewing (like ice cream, pudding, soft cakes)\n \n   Use ground meats and ground meat casseroles, or fish. Sauces and gravies make meats easier to swallow.\n \n  \n \n  Call the cancer team if the patient\n \n   \n   Gags, coughs, or chokes more than usual, especially while eating or drinking\n \n   Has a severe sore throat\n \n   Has a red, shiny mouth or ulcers in the mouth or on tongue\n \n   Has a fever higher than their usual or higher than the level instructed by the cancer care team when taken by mouth\n \n   Has trouble breathing\n \n   Has chest congestion\n \n   Has problems with food “sticking” as it goes down\n \n   Cannot swallow medicines or eat\n"

Weight loss of more than 3 pounds in a week\n     should be reported to your cancer team. There are a number of possible causes for weight loss, including:\n \n   \n   Eating less due to nausea or poor appetite\n \n   \n \n   \n \n   Dehydration (not taking in enough fluid to make up for fluid that’s lost)\n \n  \n \n  What to look for\n \n   \n   Weight loss of 3 pounds or more in a week ( or less than a week)\n \n   Weight loss continues without trying\n \n   Dry skin\n \n   Fatigue or weakness\n \n   Feeling very thirsty\n \n   Dizziness\n \n   Clothes or rings are too big\n \n  \n \n  If you want to try to stop losing weight \n \n   \n   Be sure to drink enough water and other liquids. Drink liquids between meals not during, so you won’t fill up.\n \n   Choose snacks that are high in calories and protein such as nuts, trail mix, dried fruit, granola, peanut butter, hard-boiled eggs, or cheese. \n \n   Drink smoothies, milkshakes, and nutritional supplements or bars to put more calories and protein in your diet.\n \n   Eat your favorite food any time of the day: Eat breakfast foods for dinner; dinner foods for lunch\n \n   Try adding high-calorie foods such as whipped cream, sour cream, cream cheese, butter, or gravy to what you eat to avoid further weight loss.\n \n   Ask about meeting with a dietitian.\n \n  \n \n  Weight gain\n \n  Some people with cancer find they don’t lose weight during treatment. They may even gain weight. This is particularly true for people with breast, prostate, or ovarian cancer who are taking certain medicines or getting hormone therapy or certain kinds of chemotherapy or targeted therapy. If you notice you’re gaining weight, tell your cancer care team so you can find out what may be causing this change\n \n  Many women with breast cancer gain weight during treatment, sometimes due to changes in hormone levels. Some may notice a weight gain if they have lymphedema. Many of the recommendations for breast cancer patients include a reduced-calorie diet much like those suggested for patients after cancer treatment has been completed. Some people find it helps their nausea to have something in their stomachs, so they eat more. Others eat more when they’re stressed or worried. If you have any questions, talk to your cancer care team about the best diet for you. \n \n  . People with certain kinds of cancer might have swelling in the abdomen (belly) that causes weight gain. Or, sometimes you gain weight because certain anti-cancer drugs cause your body to hold on to extra fluid. If this is the case, your doctor may ask you to talk with a registered dietitian for help with limiting the amount of salt you eat. This is important because salt might cause your body to hold extra water. \n \n  An increase in weight over time might also suggest a serious health condition, such as diabetes or high blood pressure. You may be able to tell if you gain or lose weight in a week by the way you feel or the way your clothes fit, or you can weigh yourself on a scale every few days. \n \n  What to look for\n \n   \n   Weight gain of 5 pounds or more in a week or less\n \n   Swollen ankles\n \n   \n \n   Feeling puffy or bloated\n \n   Tight shoes, clothes, or rings\n \n  \n \n  If you want to try to stop gaining weight\n \n   \n   Ask if you need to limit fluid if your ankles are swollen. If you have swelling in your abdomen (belly), limiting fluids may not help and you should call your cancer care team. \n \n   Choose healthier, lower calorie foods. \n \n   Cut back on sugar-sweetened beverages.\n \n   Limit your salt intake.\n \n   Limit food portions especially with high-calorie foods.\n \n   Read food labels to become more aware of portion sizes and calories. Be aware that “low-fat” or “non-fat” doesn’t always mean “low-calorie.”\n \n   Try to walk daily if you can and if it’s OK with your doctor. Talk with your cancer care team about referral to a physical therapist to help you safely increase activity levels.\n \n   Ask about meeting with a dietitian.\n \n  \n \n  What caregivers can do\n \n   \n   Weigh the patient at the same time every day and record it along with the date. A good time is in the morning before eating or drinking.\n \n   Talk to the cancer team if the patient’s weight loss or weight gain concerns you.\n \n   Watch the patient for other symptoms.\n \n  \n \n  Call the cancer team if the patient\n \n   \n   Loses or gains more than 3 pounds in a week\n \n   Has shortness of breath\n \n   Feels dizzy or becomes confused\n"

Common causes include:\n \n   \n   Certain kinds of tumors in the head and neck area\n \n   Radiation to the head and neck area\n \n   Certain kinds of chemotherapy and targeted therapy\n \n   Mouth sores or dryness due to certain treatments\n \n   Some medications used to help with side effects or other non-cancer problems\n \n  \n \n  What to look for\n \n  Taste and smell changes can often affect your appetite. They might be described as:\n \n   \n   Not being able to smell things other people do, or noticing a reduced sense of smell.\n \n   Noticing things smell different or certain smells are stronger\n \n   Having a bitter or metallic taste in the mouth.\n \n   Food tasting too salty or sweet. \n \n   Food not having much taste.\n \n  \n \n  Usually these changes go away after treatment ends, but sometimes they can last a long time.\n \n  What the patient and caregiver can do\n \n   \n   Try using plastic forks, spoons, and knives and glass cups and plates.\n \n   Try sugar-free lemon drops, gum, or mints.\n \n   Try fresh or frozen fruits and vegetables instead of canned.\n \n   Season foods with tart flavors.  Use lemon wedges, lemonade, citrus fruits, vinegar, and pickled foods. (If you have a sore mouth or throat, do not do this.)\n \n   Try flavoring foods with new tastes or spices (onion, garlic, chili powder, basil, oregano, rosemary, tarragon, BBQ sauce, mustard, ketchup, or mint).\n \n   Counter a salty taste with added sweeteners, a sweet taste with added lemon juice and salt, and a bitter taste with added sweeteners.\n \n   Rinse your mouth with a baking soda, salt, and water mouthwash before eating to help foods taste better. (Mix 1 teaspoon salt and 1 teaspoon baking soda in 4 cups of water. Shake well before swishing and spitting.)\n \n   Keep your mouth clean and brush your teeth to help ease bad tastes.\n \n   Serve foods cold or at room temperature. This can decrease the foods’ tastes and smells, making them easier to tolerate.\n \n   Freeze fruits like cantaloupe, grapes, oranges, and watermelon, and eat them as frozen treats.\n \n   Eat fresh vegetables. They may be more tempting than canned or frozen ones.\n \n   Try marinating meats to make them tender.\n \n   If red meats taste strange, try other protein-rich foods like chicken, fish, beans or peas, tofu, nuts, seeds, eggs, or cheese.\n \n   Blend fresh fruits into shakes, ice cream, or yogurt.\n \n   To reduce smells, cover beverages and drink through a straw; choose foods that don’t need to be cooked; and avoid eating in rooms that are stuffy or too warm.\n"

        "text": "What Is a Colostomy?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n \n \n  \nA colostomy is an opening in the belly (abdominal wall) that’s made during surgery. It's usually needed because a problem is causing the colon to not work properly, or a disease is affecting a part of the colon and it needs to be removed. The end of the colon (large intestine) is brought through this opening in the skin to form a stoma\n. A colostomy might only be needed for a short time (temporary), maybe for 3 to 6 months. A temporary colostomy may be used when a part of the colon needs time to rest and heal from a problem or disease. But sometimes a disease, such as cancer, is more serious and a colostomy may be needed for the rest of a person's life (permanent).\n \n  Where the colostomy stoma will be on the abdomen depends on which part of the colon is affected. Some colostomies are large, some small; some are on the left side of the abdomen, some are on the right, others may be in the middle. A Wound Ostomy Continence nurse (WOCN or WOC nurse) or the surgeon will figure out the best location for your stoma. (A WOC nurse is a specially-trained registered nurse who takes care of and teaches ostomy patients. This nurse may also be called an ostomy nurse.)\n \n  When you look at a stoma, you are actually looking at the lining (the mucosa\n) of the intestine, which looks a lot like the inside lining of your cheek. The stoma will look pink to red. It’s warm and moist and secretes small amounts of mucus.\n \n  The way the stoma looks depends on the type of colostomy the surgeon makes and on individual body differences. It may look quite large at first, but will shrink to its final size about 6 to 8 weeks after surgery. The shape will be round to oval. Some stomas may stick out a little, while others are flat against the skin.\n \n  Unlike the anus, the stoma has no valve or shut-off muscle. This means you won’t be able to control stool passing from the stoma, but sometimes bowel movements can be managed in other ways. There are no nerve endings in the stoma, so the stoma itself is not a source of pain or discomfort.\n  \n  \n \n  A colostomy changes the way your body works to allow stool to pass. After a colostomy has been created, the intestines will work just like they did before except:\n \n   \n   The colon and rectum beyond the colostomy are disconnected or removed.\n \n   The anus is no longer the exit for stool, but it will still pass mucus from time to time. This is normal.\n \n  \n \n  Since nutrients are absorbed in the small intestine, a colostomy does not change how the body uses food. The main functions of the colon are to absorb water, move the stool toward the anus, and then store stool in the rectum until it’s passed out of the body. When a colostomy changes the stool’s route, the storage area is no longer available.\n \n  The higher up in the colon the colostomy is made, the shorter the colon is. A shorter colon means it has less time to absorb water, making the stool softer or more liquid. A colostomy further down in the colon, near the rectum, will put out stool that has been in the intestine a longer time. Depending on the effects of illness, medicines, or other forms of treatment, the longer colon can put out a more solid or formed stool. Some people with colostomies find that they are able to pass this stool at certain times of the day with or without the help of irrigation. (See Caring for a Colostomy.)\n \n  After surgery, some people still may feel urges and even have some discharge from the anus. This discharge is mucus, blood, and at times stool, left from the operation. If the rectum remains after surgery, it will keep putting out mucus that can be passed harmlessly whenever you have the urge.\n"

        "text": "Types of Colostomies and Pouching Systems\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n \n \n  \nA colostomy can be short-term (temporary) or life-long (permanent) and can be made in any part of the colon. The different types of colostomies are based on where they are located on the colon.\n \n  Temporary colostomies\n \n  Certain lower bowel problems are treated by giving part of the bowel a rest. It’s kept empty by keeping stool from getting to that part of the bowel. To do this, a short-term (temporary) colostomy is created so that the bowel can heal. This healing process usually takes a few weeks or months, but may take years. In time, the colostomy will be reversed (removed) and the bowel will work like it did before – the stool will exit from the anus again.\n \n  Permanent colostomies\n \n  When part of the colon or the rectum becomes diseased, a long-term (permanent) colostomy must be made. The diseased part of the bowel is removed or permanently rested. In this case, the colostomy is considered permanent and is not expected to be closed in the future.\n \n  Transverse colostomies\n \n  A transverse colostomy is one of the most common types. There are 2 types of transverse colostomies: the loop transverse colostomy and the double-barrel transverse colostomy. The transverse colostomy is in the upper abdomen, either in the middle or toward the right side of the body. This type of colostomy allows the stool to leave the body before it reaches the descending colon. Some of the colon problems that can lead to a transverse colostomy include:\n \n   \n   Diverticulitis. This is inflammation of diverticula (little sacs along the colon). It can cause abscesses, scarring with stricture (abnormal narrowing), or rupture of the colon and infection in severe cases.\n \n   Inflammatory bowel disease\n \n   Cancer\n \n   Obstruction (blockage)\n \n   Injury\n \n   Birth defects\n \n  \n \n  If there are problems in the lower bowel, the affected part of the bowel might need time to rest and heal. A transverse colostomy may be used to keep stool out of the area of the colon that’s inflamed, infected, diseased, or newly operated on – this allows healing to take place. This type of colostomy is usually temporary. Depending on the healing process, the colostomy may be needed for a few weeks or months, but possibly for years. If the colon heals over time, the colostomy is likely to be surgically reversed (closed). You will have normal bowel function after it's reversed.\n \n  A permanent transverse colostomy is made when the lower portion of the colon must be removed or permanently rested, or if other health problems make the patient unable to have more surgery. The colostomy is then the permanent exit for stool and will not be closed in the future.\n \n  The loop colostomy may look like one very large stoma, but it has 2 openings. One opening puts out stool, the other only puts out mucus. The colon normally makes small amounts of mucus to protect itself from the bowel contents. This mucus passes with the bowel movements and is usually not noticed. Despite the colostomy, the resting part of the colon keeps making mucus that will come out either through the stoma or through the rectum and anus. This is normal and expected.\n \n \n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n \n \n  \nWhen creating a double-barrel colostomy, the surgeon divides the bowel completely. Each opening is brought to the surface as a separate stoma. The 2 stomas may or may not be separated by skin. Here, too, one opening puts out stool and the other puts out only mucus (this smaller stoma is called a mucus fistula). Sometimes the end of the inactive part of the bowel is sewn closed and left inside the belly. Then there’s only one stoma. The mucus from the resting portion of the bowel comes out through the anus\n \n \n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n \n \n  \nChanges in the newly formed transverse colostomy\n \n  Right after surgery, your colostomy may be covered with bandages or it may have a clear pouch over it. The type of pouch used right after surgery is usually different from those you’ll use at home. Before you look at your colostomy for the first time, keep in mind that it may be quite swollen after surgery; there may also be bruises and stitches. While a stoma normally is moist and pink or red in color, it may be darker at first. Your stoma will change a lot as it heals. It will get smaller and any discoloration will go away, leaving a moist red or pink stoma. This may take several weeks.\n \n  You’ll soon notice that, although you can usually tell when your colostomy is going to pass stool or gas, you can’t control it. Your colostomy does not have a valve-like sphincter muscle like your anus does. Because of this, you’ll need to wear a pouch over your colostomy to collect the output. Your ostomy nurse \nor doctor will help you find a pouching system that’s right for you.  This is also discussed in more detail below in \"Choosing a colostomy pouching system.\"\n \n  Managing a transverse colostomy\n \n  When a colostomy is made in the right half of the colon (near the ascending colon), only a short portion of colon leading to it is active. The stool that comes out of a transverse colostomy varies from person to person and even from time to time. A few transverse colostomies put out firm or paste-like stool at infrequent intervals, but most of them move often and put out soft or loose, oatmeal-like stool.\n \n  It’s important to know that the stool contains digestive enzymes (chemicals made by the body to break down food). These enzymes are very irritating, so the nearby skin must be protected with a skin barrier. (See \"Protecting the skin around the stoma\" under Caring for a Colostomy for more on this.)\n \n  Trying to control a transverse colostomy with special diets, medicines, enemas, or irrigations usually doesn’t work and is not usually advised. In most cases, a pouching system is worn over a transverse colostomy at all times. A lightweight, drainable pouch holds the output and protects the skin from contact with the stool. The pouch doesn’t usually bulge, and it’s not easy to see under your clothes.\n \n  Bowel movements with a transverse colostomy\n \n  A transverse colostomy will put out stool no matter what you do. Keep in mind these points:\n \n   \n   The right pouching system (also called an appliance) for you is one that will keep you from soiling your clothing.\n \n   The firmness of your stool is affected by what you eat and drink.\n \n   Gas and odor are part of the digestive process and cannot be prevented. But they can be controlled. Your pouch will help to control odors.\n \n   Empty the pouch when it’s about 1/3 to 1/2 full to keep it from leaking or bulging under your clothes. It's best to arrange a space in your bathroom at home, and to find a bathroom when you're out, where you can empty your pouch.\n \n   Change the pouch system before there’s a leak. It’s best to change it no more than once a day and not less than once every 3 or 4 days.\n \n   The ostomy output can irritate your skin. You can help prevent skin problems by having a correctly fitted pouch system and by using special materials for ostomy care.\n \n  \n \n  Ascending colostomy\n \n  The ascending colostomy is placed on the right side of the belly. Only a short portion of colon remains active. This means that the output is liquid and contains many digestive enzymes. A drainable pouch must be worn at all times, and the skin must be protected from the output. This type of colostomy is rare because an ileostomy is often a better choice if the discharge is liquid. (For more on this, see Ileostomy: A Guide.)\n \n  Caring for an ascending colostomy is much like caring for a transverse colostomy (as discussed above).\n \n  Descending and sigmoid colostomies\n \n  Located in the descending colon, the descending colostomy (Figure 6) is placed on the lower left side of the belly. Most often, the output is firm and can be controlled.\n \n  A sigmoid colostomy (Figure 7) is the most common type of colostomy. It’s made in the sigmoid colon, and located just a few inches lower than a descending colostomy. Because there’s more working colon, it may put out solid stool on a more regular schedule. \n \n \n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n \n \n  \nBoth the descending and the sigmoid colostomies can have a double-barrel or single-barrel opening. The single-barrel, or end colostomy, is more common. The stoma of the end colostomy is either sewn flush with the skin or it’s turned back on itself (like the turned-down top of a sock).\n \n  You will notice with a descending or sigmoid colostomy:\n \n   \n   The stool is firmer or more like paste. It doesn’t have as much of the irritating digestive enzymes in it.\n \n   Stool output may happen as a reflex at regular, expected times. The bowel movement will take place after a certain amount of stool has collected in the bowel above the colostomy. Two or 3 days may go between movements\n \n   Spilling may happen between movements because there’s no muscle to hold the stool back. Many people use a lightweight, disposable pouch to prevent accidents\n \n   Feeling the need to empty the bowel (reflex) will happen quite naturally in some people. Others may need mild stimulation, such as juice, coffee, a meal, a mild laxative, or irrigation. \n \n  \n \n  Bowel movements with a descending or sigmoid colostomy\n \n   A bowel movement through a colostomy happens naturally like a normal movement through the anus. But, unlike the anal opening, the colostomy does not have nerves or a sphincter muscle that can help to stop the passage of stool.\n \n   \n   You must wear a pouch to collect anything that might come through, whether it’s expected or not. Many lightweight pouches are hard to see under clothes. They stick to the skin around the colostomy and may be worn all the time, or only as needed.\n \n   For some people, eating certain foods at certain times can make the bowel move at a time that works best for them. Some people use only this method to keep bowel movements on a regular schedule, while others use it with irrigation.\n \n  \n \n  Constipation or loose stool\n \n  Many people think that you must have a bowel movement every day. In truth, this varies from person to person. Some people have 2 or 3 movements a day, while others have a bowel movement every 2 or 3 days or even less often. It may take some time after surgery to figure out what’s normal for you.\n \n  While many descending and sigmoid colostomies can be trained to move regularly, some cannot. Training, with or without stimulation, is likely to happen only in those people who had regular bowel movements before they became ill. If bowel movements were irregular in earlier years, it may be hard, or impossible, to have regular, predictable colostomy function. Spastic colon, irritable bowel, and some types of indigestion are some conditions that cause people with colostomies to continue to have bouts of constipation or loose stool. \n \n  Closing or reversing a colostomy\n \n  If you’re going to have your colostomy closed, the surgeon might mention plans to “take it down” or “reverse it” in a few weeks or months, but sometimes the doctor doesn’t say anything about it. It’s best to talk to your surgeon about these things before you leave the hospital so you know what the plans are and when to see the surgeon again. If you’re at home now and didn’t get instructions, call the doctor’s office or clinic and find out what the doctor wants you to do. It’s your job to stay in touch with the doctor.\n \n  Many things must be taken into account when thinking about closing a colostomy, such as:\n \n   \n   The reason you needed the colostomy\n \n   Whether you can handle more surgery\n \n   Your health since the operation\n \n   Other problems that may have come up during or after surgery\n \n  \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n \n \n  \nChoosing a pouching system\n \n  Deciding what pouching system or appliance is best for you is a very personal matter. When you’re trying out your first pouching system, it’s best to talk with an ostomy nurse or someone who has experience in this area. There should be someone in the hospital who can get you started with equipment and instructions after surgery.\n \n  As you’re getting ready to leave the hospital, be sure you are referred to a Wound Ostomy Continence nurse (WOCN or WOC nurse, also called an ostomy nurse\n), a clinic, an ostomy manufacturer, or a chapter of the United Ostomy Associations of America. Even if you must go out of town to get such help, it’s worthwhile, as you want to get a good start and avoid mistakes. Even with help, you may have to try different types or brands of pouching systems to find the one that best suits you. (See Getting Colostomy Help, Information, and Support.)\n \n  There are many things to think about when trying to find the pouching system that will work best for you. The length of the stoma, abdominal firmness and shape, the location of the stoma, scars and folds near the stoma, and your height and weight all must be considered. Special changes may have to be made for stomas near the hipbone, waistline, groin, or scars. Some companies have custom-made products to fit unusual situations.\n \n  A good pouching system should:\n \n   \n   Stay secure, with a good leak-proof seal that lasts for up to 3 days\n \n   Be odor-resistant\n \n   Protect the skin around the stoma\n \n   Be nearly invisible under clothing\n \n   Be easy to put on and take off\n \n   Allow you to shower or bathe with the pouch on, if you wish to do so\n \n  \n \n  Types of pouching systems\n \n  Pouches come in many styles and sizes, and an ostomy nurse can help you choose the best one for your situation and lifestyle. They all have a collection pouch to collect stool drainage that comes out of the stoma and an adhesive barrier (called a flange, skin barrier, or wafer) that protects the surrounding skin. There are 2 main types of systems available:\n \n   \n   One-piece pouches have both a pouch and skin barrier attached together in the same unit. When the pouch is removed, the barrier also comes off.\n \n   Two-piece systems are made up of a skin barrier separate from a pouch. When the pouch is taken off, the barrier stays in place.\n \n  \n \n  Some pouching systems can be opened at the bottom for easy emptying. Others are closed and are taken off when they are full. Still others allow the adhesive skin barrier to stay on the body while the pouch may be taken off, washed out, and reused. Pouches are made from odor-resistant materials and vary in cost. They can be either clear or opaque and come in different lengths.\n \n  Figures 8 through 15 show some of the different kinds of pouches, plus other supplies that may be needed, such as flanges, clips, and belts (to help hold the pouch in place).\n \n \n\n\n\n\t\n    \t\n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n        \n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\t\n    \t\n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n        \n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\t\n    \t\n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n        \n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\t\n    \t\n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n        \n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n \n \n  \nThe opening of the skin barrier or wafer of the pouch needs to fit your stoma. The opening should be no more than 1/8 inch larger than the stoma. Depending on the pouch design, you may need to cut a hole out for your stoma, or the wafer may be sized and pre-cut. The size of the hole is important because the wafer is designed to protect the nearby skin from the stoma output and be as gentle to the skin as possible. \n \n  Keep in mind a stoma's size can change if it becomes swollen or for other reasons. For example, after surgery, your stoma may be swollen for about 6 to 8 weeks. During this time the stoma should be measured about once a week. A measuring card may be included in boxes of pouches, or you can make your own template to match your stoma shape and get the best fit.\n \n \n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\nStoma cap\nIf your colostomy puts out stool at regular, expected times, you may be able to use a stoma cover instead of always wearing a pouch. You can place neatly-folded gauze or tissue, dabbed with a small amount of water-soluble lubricant over the stoma, and cover it with a piece of plastic wrap. This can be held in place with medical tape, underclothes, or an elastic garment. Plastic, ready-made stoma caps (Figure 16) are also available.\n"

        "text": "Caring for a Colostomy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n \n \n  \nProtecting the skin around the stoma\n \n  The skin around your stoma should always look the same as skin anywhere else on your abdomen. But ostomy output can make this skin tender or sore. Here are some ways to help keep your skin healthy:\n \n  . An opening that’s too small can cut or injure the stoma and may cause it to swell. If the opening is too large, output could get to and irritate the skin. In both cases, change the pouch or skin barrier and replace it with one that fits well.\n \n   to avoid leaks and skin irritation. It's important to have a regular schedule for changing your pouch. Don't wait for leaks or other signs of problems, such as itching and burning.\n \n  . Remove the skin barrier gently by pushing your skin away from the sticky barrier rather than pulling the barrier away from the skin.\n \n  . Dry the skin completely before putting on the skin barrier or pouch.\n \n   to the adhesive, skin barrier, paste, tape, or pouch material. They can develop after weeks, months, or even years of using a product because you can become sensitized over time. If your skin is irritated only where the plastic pouch touches it, you might try a pouch cover or a different brand of pouch. A stoma nurse can offer ideas if needed. Pouch covers are available from supply manufacturers, or you can make your own. You may have to test different products to see how your skin reacts to them. \n \n  \n  \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n \n \n  \nColostomy irrigation (for descending and sigmoid colostomies only)\n \n  Colostomy irrigation is something that can be done with certain types of colostomies to help move stool through the colon. If you have a descending or sigmoid colostomy, you may choose to manage your colostomy with irrigation. Irrigation is simply putting water into the colon through the stoma to help regulate bowel movements.\n \n  Colostomy irrigation has been used for many years, but it's not used as much now as years ago. This is probably because pouch systems have improved. \n \n  Whether to irrigate is up to each person, but you should fully discuss it with your doctor or ostomy nurse before a decision is made. Your doctor or ostomy nurse will teach you how to irrigate your colostomy. The procedure may be a little different from what we describe here, depending on the experience of the person teaching you.\n \n  Talk to your doctor or ostomy nurse about irrigation. Whether you will choose to irrigate your colostomy and how you do it depends on many factors, such as your:\n \n   \n   Lifelong bowel habits\n \n   Activity level\n \n   Skill and comfort level with irrigation\n \n   Personal feelings about the colostomy\n \n  \n  \n  If you decide to irrigate, try to find a method, or combination of methods, that most closely matches your body’s normal bowel habit or pattern. At first, you may need to try different things under a doctor or nurse’s guidance. Just remember, it will take time to set up a routine. Having regular daily habits will help. If you find certain foods or irrigation procedures help regulate your bowel movements, keep doing those things at the same time every day. Regular habits will promote regular bowel functions, but occasional changes in routine won’t harm you.\n \n  The equipment (Figures 17 to 20) you’ll use includes:\n \n   \n   A . The plastic cone-shaped piece at end of the tubing fits snugly against the stoma to run water into the colostomy.\n \n   An  to carry the irrigation output into the toilet.\n \n   A  and a belt for extra irrigation sleeve support. (This is optional.)\n \n  \n \n \n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n \n \n  \nIf you choose to irrigate\n \n  When to irrigate\n \n   \n   Choose a time in the day when you know you’ll have the bathroom to yourself.\n \n   Irrigation may work better if it’s done after a meal or a hot or warm drink. Also, consider irrigating at about the same time of day you usually moved your bowels before you had the colostomy.\n \n  \n \n  How to irrigate\n \n   \n   Get your irrigation supplies together\n \n   Clamp the tubing and put 1000 cc (about 1 quart) of lukewarm (not hot) water in the irrigating container. You may need a little less. NEVER connect the tube directly to the faucet.\n \n   Hang the container at a height that makes the bottom of it level with your shoulder when you are seated.\n \n   Sit on the toilet or on a chair next to it. Sit up straight.\n \n   Seal the plastic irrigation sleeve onto your skin barrier and put the bottom end of the sleeve in the toilet bowl.\n \n   Wet the end of the cone or lubricate it with water-soluble lubricant.\n \n   Remove air bubbles from the tubing by opening the clamp on the tubing and letting a small amount of water run into the sleeve.\n \n   Re-clamp the tubing and put the cone into your stoma as far as it will go, but not beyond its widest point.\n \n   Slowly open the clamp on the tubing and allow the water to gently flow into your bowel. The water must go in slowly. You may shut the clamp or squeeze the tube to slow or stop the water flow. It takes about 5 minutes to drip in 1000 cc (about 1 quart) of water.\n \n   Hold the cone in place for about 10 seconds after all the water has gone in.\n \n   The amount of water you need depends on your own body. You may need less, but do not use more than 1000 cc (1 quart). The purpose of irrigating is to remove stool, not to be strict about the amount of water used.\n \n   You should not have cramps or nausea while the water flows in. These are signs that either the water is running in too fast, you’re using too much water, or the water is too cold. After the water has been put in, a bowel movement-type cramp may happen as the stool comes out.\n \n   After the water has run in, remove the cone. Output or “returns” will come in spurts over the next 45 minutes or so.\n \n   As soon as most of the stool has come out, you may clip the bottom of the irrigating sleeve to the top with a tail closure clip. This allows you to move around, bathe, or do anything you wish to pass the time.\n \n   When done, recheck the wafer seal and put your usual pouch back on. Rinse the bag, cone, and sleeve and hang to dry.\n \n  \n \n  With time and experience, you’ll know when all the water and stool have come out. A squirt of gas may be a sign that the process is done, or the stoma may look quiet or inactive. If the complete irrigation process always takes much more than an hour, talk to your doctor or ostomy nurse.\n \n  Emptying and changing the pouching system\n \n  You’ll be taught how to change and empty your pouching system before you leave the hospital. You don’t have to use sterile supplies. For instance, facial tissue, toilet paper, or paper towels can be used to clean around the stoma instead of sterile gauze pads.\n \n  How to empty the pouch\n \n  Empty the ostomy pouchwhen it is about 1/3 to 1/2 full to keep it from bulging and leaking. Follow these steps:\n \n   \n   Sit as far back on the toilet as you can or on a chair facing the toilet.\n \n   Place a small strip of toilet paper in the toilet to decrease splashing.\n \n   Hold the bottom of the pouch up and open the clip on the end or tail of the pouch.\n \n   Slowly unroll the tail over the toilet.\n \n   Gently empty the contents. You can put some toilet paper in the toilet first to help avoid splashing if needed.\n \n   Clean the outside and inside of the pouch tail with toilet paper.\n \n   Roll up the end of the pouch and clip.\n \n  \n \n  When to change the pouching system\n \n  It's best to have a regular changing schedule so problems don't develop. Different pouching systems are made to last different lengths of time. Some are changed every day, some every 3 days or so, and some just once a week. It depends on the type of pouch you use.\n \n  There may be less bowel activity at certain times in the day. It’s easiest to change the pouching system during these times. You may find that early morning before you eat or drink is best. Or allow at least 1 hour after a meal, when digestive movement has slowed down. Right after surgery, ostomy output may be thin and watery. As the output gets thicker, you’ll be better able to find the best time for changing your system.\n \n  Factors that affect the pouching system seal\n \n  The pouching system must stick to your skin. It’s important to change it before it loosens or leaks. The length of time a pouch will stay sealed to the skin depends on many things, such as the weather, skin condition, scars, weight changes, diet, activity, body shape near the stoma, and the nature of the ostomy output. Here are some other things that may affect how long a pouch sticks:\n \n   \n   Sweating will shorten the number of days you can wear the pouching system. Body heat, added to outside temperature, will cause skin barriers to loosen more quickly than usual.\n \n   Moist, oily skin may reduce wearing time.\n \n   Weight changes will affect how long you can wear a pouch. Weight gained or lost after ostomy surgery can change the shape of your abdomen. You may need an entirely different system.\n \n   Diet may affect your seal. Foods that cause watery output are more likely to break a seal than a thicker discharge.\n \n   Physical activities may affect wearing time. Swimming, very strenuous sports, or anything that makes you sweat may shorten wear time.\n \n  \n \n  Bathing\n \n  Water will not hurt your ostomy. Normal exposure to air or contact with soap and water won’t harm the stoma. Water will not flow into the stoma. Soap will not irritate it, but soap may interfere with the skin barrier sticking to the skin. It’s best to only use water while cleaning the skin around your stoma. If you do use soap, be sure to rinse your skin well.\n \n  If you shower, you can remove your pouch, but it's not necessary and not usually recommended. If you take a bath, it's recommended to leave the pouch in place.  One big reason not to remove your pouch when you shower or bathe is to avoid the risk of fecal output happening, which of course you cannot control. \n \n  Spots of blood on the stoma\n \n  Spots of blood are not a cause for alarm. Cleaning around the stoma as you change the pouch or skin barrier may cause slight bleeding. The blood vessels in the tissues of the stoma are very delicate at the surface and are easily disturbed. The bleeding will usually stop quickly. If it doesn’t, call your ostomy nurse or your doctor.\n \n  Shaving hair under the pouch\n \n  Having a lot of hair around the stoma can make it hard to get the skin barrier to stick well and may cause pain when you remove it. Shaving with a razor or trimming hair with scissors is helpful. Extra care should always be taken when doing this. It’s recommended that you dry shave the skin around your stoma with stoma powder, since soap and shaving creams have lotions and oils that may cause the skin barrier not to stick. After shaving, rinse well and dry the skin well before applying your pouch. \n \n  What to wear when you have a colostomy\n \n  You will not need special clothes for everyday wear. Ostomy pouches, especially certain kinds, are fairly flat and hard to see under most clothing. The pressure of elastic undergarments won’t harm the stoma or prevent bowel function.\n \n  If you were sick before surgery, you may find you can now eat normally for the first time in years. As your appetite returns, you may gain weight. This can affect the clothes you choose more than the pouching system itself.\n \n  Snug undergarments such as cotton stretch underpants, t-shirts, or camisoles may give you extra support, security, and help conceal pouches. A simple pouch cover adds comfort by absorbing body sweat and keeps the plastic pouch from resting against your skin. Men can wear either boxer or jockey-type shorts. \n \n  Managing colostomy problems\n \n  Gas (flatulence)\n \n  Right after surgery it may seem that you have a lot of gas almost all the time. Most abdominal surgery is followed by this uncomfortable, embarrassing, yet harmless symptom. Gassy noises or stomach rumblings may be a concern.  If you are concerned about others nearby hearing this, you can say, “Excuse me, my stomach’s growling.” If you feel as though you are about to release gas when you’re with people, casually fold your arms across your belly so that your forearm rests over your stoma. This will muffle most sounds. Check with your ostomy nurse about products you can take to help lessen gas. Certain foods may cause gas, such as eggs, cabbage, broccoli, onions, fish, beans, milk, cheese, carbonated drinks, and alcohol.\n \n   \n   Eating regularly will help prevent gas.\n \n   Eat smaller amounts of food 4 to 5 times a day.    \n \n   skip meals to avoid gas or output.\n \n  \n \n  Odor\n \n  Many factors, such as foods, normal bacteria in your intestine, illness, certain medicines, and vitamins can cause odor.\n \n   \n   Some foods can produce odor: eggs, cabbage, cheese, cucumber, onion, garlic, fish, dairy foods, and coffee are among them. If you find that certain foods bother you, avoid them.\n \n   Use an odor-resistant pouch.\n \n   Check to see that the skin barrier is stuck securely to your skin.\n \n   Empty the pouch often.\n \n   Place special deodorant liquids and/or tablets in the pouch.\n \n   There are some medicines you can take that may help. Check with your doctor or ostomy nurse about these products and how to use them. Some things that many people have found help with odor are chlorophyll tablets, bismuth subgallate, and bismuth subcarbonate. Keeping air deodorizers in that room can also control odor very well when you are emptying the pouch\n \n  \n \n  Finding medicine capsules in your pouch\n \n  Be aware that coated tablets or time-released capsules may come out whole in the pouch. In most cases, this means you didn’t get the medicine. If you notice this, talk with your health care provider or pharmacist. There may be other medicines you can use to make sure you’re getting what you need. Liquid or liquid gel medicines tend to absorb faster and may work better for you.\n \n  Severe skin problems\n \n  Large areas of skin that are red, sore, and weeping (always wet) will keep you from getting a good seal around your stoma. It’s important to treat minor irritations right away. If you have a large irritated area, or one that’s getting larger despite special care, contact your doctor or ostomy nurse. They may prescribe medicine to take by mouth or to put around your ostomy to help dry out and heal your skin.\n \n  For deep pressure ulcers caused by a very tight ostomy belt, loosen or remove the belt and call your doctor or ostomy nurse right away. You will need treatment.\n \n  Blockage (obstruction)\n \n  There will be times when your ostomy does not have output for short periods of time. This is normal. But, if your stoma is not active for 4 to 6 hours and you have cramps, pain, and/or nausea, the intestine could be blocked (the medical word is obstructed\n). Call your doctor or ostomy nurse right away if this happens.\n \n  These are some things you can do to help move things through your ostomy:\n \n   \n   Watch for swelling of the stoma and adjust the opening of the wafer as needed until the swelling goes down.\n \n   Take a warm bath to relax your abdominal muscles.\n \n   Fluids can be taken if there is some stool output: solid foods should be avoided \n \n   Sometimes changing your position, such as drawing your knees up to your chest, may help move along the food in your gut.\n \n   Do  take a laxative.\n \n  \n \n  Foods high in fiber such as cabbage, greens, celery, pineapple, nuts, coconut, and corn can cause obstruction. Obstruction can also be caused by internal changes such as adhesions (scar tissue that forms inside your abdomen after surgery).\n \n  If you keep having pain and cramping with no output from your stoma for more than 2 hours, and you can’t reach your doctor or ostomy nurse, go to the emergency room. Take all your ostomy supplies with you.\n \n  Diarrhea\n \n  Diarrhea is usually a warning that something isn’t right. Diarrhea is defined as frequent loose or watery bowel movements in greater amounts than usual. It happens when food passes through the small intestine too quickly for fluids and electrolytes to be absorbed. It can come on suddenly and may cause cramps. It can cause your body to lose a lot of fluids and electrolytes. You must quickly replace these electrolytes to avoid getting sick from dehydration and mineral loss. (See Electrolyte imbalance below for more on this.)\n \n  Loose stool can also come from eating certain foods, but it usually only lasts a short time. Raw fruits and vegetables, milk, fruit juice, prune juice, or impure drinking water are examples of things that may change your stoma output. Emotional stress may also cause loose stool. Some people with ileostomies may always have “watery discharge,” and this is normal for them.\n \n  Several things can cause diarrhea:\n \n   \n   Intestinal infection or food poisoning, which may also cause fever and/or vomiting\n \n   Antibiotics and other prescription medicines\n \n   Partial blockage, which also causes smelly discharge, cramps, forceful liquid output, and a lot of noises from the stoma. It can be caused by food or other factors. Get medical help if this happens to you.\n \n  \n \n  Talk with your doctor or ostomy nurse if you have ongoing diarrhea. Discuss the foods and liquids you take in, your eating schedule, how much you usually eat, and any medicines you might be taking. You may be given medicine to help slow things down. Remember, no matter what, you need a well-balanced diet and good fluid intake to have a good output.\n \n  Electrolyte imbalance\n \n  Electrolytes are salts and minerals in the blood, like potassium, magnesium, and sodium. Keeping them balanced is important. When the colon (large intestine) is removed, you’re at a greater risk for electrolyte imbalance. Diarrhea, vomiting, and a lot of sweating can increase this risk.\n \n  Dehydration is also a serious concern. Symptoms include increased thirst, dry mouth, decreased urine output, feeling light-headed, and feeling tired. If you get dehydrated, you’ll need to drink more fluids. To avoid dehydration, you should try to drink 8 to 10 eight-ounce glasses of fluid a day. If you have diarrhea, you may need more. Drinks such as Gatorade, PowerAde, or Pedialyte contain potassium and sodium. But any liquid containing water (soda, milk, juice, tea, etc.) helps to meet your daily need for fluid.\n \n  Loss of appetite, drowsiness, and leg cramps may be signs of sodium loss. Fatigue, muscle weakness, and shortness of breath may be signs of potassium loss. Dehydration, low sodium, and low potassium can all be dangerous and should be treated right away. Keep in mind that some of these symptoms can be caused by other problems which may be emergencies. Call your doctor or 911 right away if you are dizzy, weak, or having other serious symptoms.\n \n  Phantom rectum\n \n  Phantom rectum is much like the “phantom limb” of amputees who feel as if their removed limb is still there. It’s normal for you to have the urge to move your bowels the way you did before surgery. This can happen at any time and may go on for years after surgery. If the rectum has not been removed, you may have this feeling and also may pass mucus when sitting on the toilet. Some people who have had their rectum removed say that the feeling is helped by sitting on the toilet and acting as if a bowel movement is taking place.\n \n  Short bowel syndrome\n \n  This condition happens when surgery is done to remove a large part of the small intestine. Short bowel syndrome needs special attention because there’s not enough intestine left to absorb the nutrients the body needs.\n \n  People with short bowel syndrome must be under a doctor’s care.

        "text": "What Is an Ileostomy?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n \n \n  \nAn ileostomy is an opening in the belly (abdominal wall) that’s made during surgery. It's usually needed because a problem is causing the ileum to not work properly, or a disease is affecting that part of the colon and it needs to be removed. The end of the ileum (the lowest part of the small intestine) is brought through this opening to form a stoma,\n usually on the lower right side of the abdomen. An ileostomy may only be needed for a short time (temporary), maybe for 3 to 6 months, because that part of the colon needs time to rest and heal from a problem or disease. But sometimes a disease, such as cancer, is more serious and an ileostomy may be needed for the rest of a person's life (permanent).\n \n  A Wound Ostomy Continence nurse (WOCN or WOC nurse) will probably work with the surgeon to figure out the best location and way to care for your stoma. (A WOC nurse is a specially trained registered nurse who takes care of and teaches ostomy patients. This nurse may also be called an ostomy nurse\n.)\n \n  When you look at your stoma, you are actually looking at the lining (the mucosa\n) of your small intestine, which looks a lot like the inside lining of your cheek. The stoma will look pink to red. It’s warm and moist and secretes small amounts of mucus. It will shrink shortly after surgery. It's shape will be round to oval. Some stomas may stick out a little, while others are flat against the skin.\n \n  Unlike the anus, the stoma has no valve or shut-off muscle. This means you won’t be able to control stool passing from the stoma. There are no nerve endings in the stoma, so the stoma itself is not a source of pain or discomfort.\n \n  As part of this surgery, the colon (the main part of large intestine) and rectum (the lowest part of large intestine where formed stool is held until it’s passed out of the body through the anus) are often removed (this is called a colectomy\n). This means that colon and rectum no longer function as they used to. Sometimes, only part of the colon and rectum are removed.\n \n  What does an ileostomy do?\n \n  After the colon and rectum are removed or bypassed, waste no longer comes out of the body through the rectum and anus. Digestive contents now leave the body through the stoma. The drainage is collected in a pouch that sticks to the skin around the stoma. The pouch is fitted to you personally. It’s worn at all times and can be emptied as needed.\n \n  Ileostomy output will be liquid to pasty, depending on what you eat, your medicines, and other factors. Because the output is constant, you’ll need to empty the pouch 5 to 8 times a day.\n \n \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            Written by\n        \n"

        "text": "Types of Ileostomies and Pouching Systems\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n \n \n  \nAn ileostomy can be short-term (temporary) or life-long (permanent). The different types of ileostomies are described here.\n \n  Temporary ileostomies\n \n  Certain bowel problems may be treated by giving part of the bowel a rest or with surgery to remove the damaged part. The bowel must be kept empty so it can heal. To keep stool from getting to the bowel, a short-term (temporary) ileostomy is created. Healing usually takes a few weeks or months, but may take years. In time, the ileostomy will be surgically reversed (removed) and the bowel will work much like it did before. A temporary ileostomy can also be done as the first stage in forming an ileo-anal reservoir (or J-pouch).\n \n  Permanent ileostomies\n \n  When part of the bowel becomes diseased, a long-term (permanent) ileostomy must be made. The diseased part of the bowel and anus are removed or permanently rested. In this case, the ileostomy is considered permanent and is not ever expected to be closed (removed).\n \n  There are 3 major types of ileostomies. You and your surgeon will talk about your options and together decide on the best surgery for you. Sometimes an ostomy nurse will also help you learn more so you are making the best decision. Some of the things to think about when planning an ileostomy are the disease process, your age, your general health, and your preference.\n \n  Standard or Brooke ileostomy\n \n  \n \n \n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\nThe standard or Brooke ileostomy surgery is the most common type. The end of the ileum is pulled through the abdominal wall and is turned back and sutured to the skin, leaving the smooth, rounded, inside-out ileum as the stoma.\nThe stoma is usually in the right lower part of the abdomen, on a flat surface of normal, smooth skin. The fecal output is not controlled. This means you’ll need to wear a collection pouch all the time, and empty it regularly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n \n \n  \nContinent ileostomy (abdominal pouch)\n \n  \n \n \n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\nA continent ileostomy is a different type of standard ileostomy. You don’t need to wear an external pouch with this kind of ileostomy.\nIt’s made by looping part of the ileum back on itself so that a reservoir or pocket is formed inside the belly (abdomen). A nipple valve is made from part of the ileum. A few times each day you put in a thin, soft tube called a to drain the waste out of the reservoir inside your belly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n \n \n  \nIleo-anal reservoir (J-pouch or pelvic pouch)\n \n  \n \n \n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\nThe ileo-anal reservoir or pelvic pouch is a pouch made from the ileum and the rectum and placed inside the body in the pelvis. Other names for this include J-pouch, W-pouch, and S-pouch depending on the surgical procedure.\nThe pouch is connected to the anus. Waste passes into the pouch, where it’s stored. When an “urge” is felt, the stool is passed through the anus, out of the body. The sphincter muscle around the anal opening must be intact to keep the pouch from leaking. The consistency of the output of the pelvic pouch depends on what you eat and drink, and may be managed with medicines. In most cases at least 2 surgeries are needed to make the ileo-anal reservoir or pelvic pouch.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n \n \n  \nChoosing a pouching system\n \n  Deciding what pouching system or appliance is best for you is a very personal matter. When you’re trying out your first pouching system, it’s best to talk with an ostomy nurse or someone who has experience in this area. There should be someone in the hospital who can get you started with equipment and instructions after surgery.\n \n  As you’re getting ready to leave the hospital, be sure you are referred to a Wound Ostomy Continence nurse (WOCN or WOC nurse, also called an ostomy nurse), a clinic, an ostomy manufacturer, or a chapter of the United Ostomy Associations of America. Even if you must go out of town to get such help, it’s worthwhile, as you want to get a good start and avoid mistakes. Even with help, you may have to try different types or brands of pouching systems to find the one that best suits you. \n \n  There are many things to think about when trying to find the pouching system that will work best for you. The length of the stoma, abdominal firmness and shape, the location of the stoma, scars and folds near the stoma, and your height and weight all must be considered. Special changes may have to be made for stomas near the hipbone, waistline, groin, or scars. Some companies have custom-made products to fit unusual situations. \n \n  A good pouching system should:\n \n   \n   Stay secure, with a good leak-proof seal that lasts for up to 3 days\n \n   Be odor-resistant\n \n   Protect the skin around the stoma\n \n   Be nearly invisible under clothing\n \n   Be easy to put on and take off\n \n   Allow you to shower or bathe with the pouch on, if you wish to do so\n \n  \n \n  Types of pouching systems\n \n  Pouches come in many styles and sizes, and an ostomy nurse can help you choose the best one for your situation and lifestyle. They all have a collection pouch to collect stool drainage that comes out of the stoma and an adhesive barrier (called a flange, skin barrier, or wafer) that protects the surrounding skin. There are 2 main types of systems available:\n \n   \n   One-piece pouches have both a pouch and skin barrier attached together in the same unit. When the pouch is removed, the barrier also comes off.\n \n   Two-piece systems have a pouch and a separate skin barrier.. When the pouch is taken off, the barrier stays in place.\n \n  \n \n  Depending on the design of your pouch's skin barrier, you may need to cut a hole out for your stoma, or it may be sized and pre-cut. It’s designed to protect the skin from the stoma output and be as gentle to the skin as possible.\n \n  Some pouching systems can be opened at the bottom for easy emptying. Others are closed and are taken off when they are full. Still others allow the adhesive skin barrier to stay on the body while the pouch may be taken off, washed out, and reused. Pouches are made from odor-resistant materials and vary in cost. They can be either clear or opaque and come in different lengths.\n \n \n\n\n\n\t\n    \t\n        \n        \n        \n\n        \n        \n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\nAfter surgery, the stoma may be swollen for about 6 to 8 weeks. During this time the stoma should be measured about once a week. A measuring card may be included in boxes of pouches, or you can make your own template to match your stoma shape. The opening on the skin barrier should be no more than 1/8 inch larger than the stoma.\nBelts and tape\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\nWearing a belt to help hold the pouch in place is a personal choice. Some people with ileostomies wear a belt because it makes them feel more secure and it supports the pouching system. Others find a belt awkward and use tape instead. Tape can be put around the outside edge of the skin barrier like a frame.\nIf you choose to wear a belt, adjust it so that you can get 2 fingers between the belt and your waist. This helps to keep you from getting a deep groove or cut in the skin around the stoma which can cause serious damage to the stoma and sores (pressure ulcers) on the nearby skin. If a belt is used, it shouldn’t ride above or below the level of the belt tabs on the pouching system. People in wheelchairs may need special belts. Supply companies often carry these special belts or an ostomy nurse can talk to you about making one yourself.\n"

        "text": "Caring for an Ileostomy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n \n \n  \nLearning to care for your ileostomy may seem hard at first, but with practice and time it will become second nature, just like shaving or bathing.\n \n  There’s no one way to take care of an ileostomy. This guide offers you tips and ideas that you can discuss with your doctor or ostomy nurse and adapt to your needs. Give new things a fair trial, but don’t keep doing them if they don’t make you more comfortable. Use your recovery time to learn and try different things so that you can find what works best for you.\n \n  In our society, bathroom needs are kept private. Talking about stool and bowel movements can be awkward or uncomfortable. This is often true for a person with an ileostomy. But while you learn how to deal with the changes that have been made, you may need help and advice. A good sense of humor and common sense are needed when changes in body function take place. Be confident. You can learn the new system. Before long you will again be in control.\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n \n \n  \nProtecting the skin around the stoma\n \n  The skin around your stoma should always look the same as skin anywhere else on your abdomen. But ostomy output can make this skin tender or sore. Here are some ways to help keep your skin healthy:\n \n  . An opening that’s too small can cut or injure the stoma and may cause it to swell. If the opening is too large, output could get to and irritate the skin. In both cases, change the pouch or skin barrier and replace it with one that fits well.\n \n   to avoid leaks and skin irritation. It's important to have a regular schedule for changing your pouch. Don't wait for leaks or other signs of problems, such as itching and burning.\n \n  . Remove the skin barrier gently by pushing your skin away from the sticky barrier rather than pulling the barrier away from the skin.\n \n  . Dry the skin completely before putting on the skin barrier or pouch.\n \n   to the adhesive, skin barrier, paste, tape, or pouch material. They can develop after weeks, months, or even years of using a product because you can become sensitized over time. If your skin is irritated only where the plastic pouch touches it, you might try a pouch cover or a different brand of pouch. A stoma nurse can offer ideas if needed. Pouch covers are available from supply manufacturers, or you can make your own. You may have to test different products to see how your skin reacts to them. \n    \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n \n     \n  \n \n \n  You’ll be taught how to change and empty your pouching system before you leave the hospital. You don’t have to use sterile supplies. For instance, facial tissue, toilet paper, or paper towels can be used to clean around the stoma instead of sterile gauze pads.\n \n  How to empty the pouch\n \n  Empty the ostomy pouch when it is about 1/3 to 1/2 full to keep it from bulging and leaking. Follow these steps:\n \n   \n   Sit as far back on the toilet as you can or on a chair facing the toilet.\n \n   Place a small strip of toilet paper in the toilet to decrease splashing.\n \n   Hold the bottom of the pouch up and open the clip on the end or tail of the pouch.\n \n   Slowly unroll the tail over the toilet.\n \n   Gently empty the contents. You can put some toilet paper in the toilet first to help avoid splashing if needed.\n \n   Clean the outside and inside of the pouch tail with toilet paper.\n \n   Roll up the end of the pouch and clip.\n \n  \n \n  When to change the pouching system\n \n  It's best to have a regular changing schedule so problems don't develop. Different pouching systems are made to last different lengths of time. Some are changed every day, some every 3 days or so, and some just once a week. It depends on the type of pouch you use.\n \n  There may be less bowel activity at certain times in the day. It’s easiest to change the pouching system during these times. You may find that early morning before you eat or drink is best. Or allow at least 1 hour after a meal, when digestive movement has slowed down. Right after surgery, ostomy output may be thin and watery. As the output gets thicker, you’ll be better able to find the best time for changing your system.\n \n  Factors that affect the pouching system seal\n \n  The pouching system must stick to your skin. It’s important to change it before it loosens or leaks. The length of time a pouch will stay sealed to the skin depends on many things, such as the weather, skin condition, scars, weight changes, diet, activity, body shape near the stoma, and the nature of the ostomy output. Here are some other things that may affect how long a pouch sticks:\n \n   \n   Sweating will shorten the number of days you can wear the pouching system. Body heat, added to outside temperature, will cause skin barriers to loosen more quickly than usual.\n \n   Moist, oily skin may reduce wearing time.\n \n   Weight changes will affect how long you can wear a pouch. Weight gained or lost after ostomy surgery can change the shape of your abdomen. You may need an entirely different system.\n \n   Diet may affect your seal. Foods that cause watery output are more likely to break a seal than a thicker discharge.\n \n   Physical activities may affect wearing time. Swimming, very strenuous sports, or anything that makes you sweat may shorten wear time.\n \n  \n \n  Bathing\n \n  Water will not hurt your ostomy. Normal exposure to air or contact with soap and water won’t harm the stoma. Water will not flow into the stoma. Soap will not irritate it, but soap may interfere with the skin barrier sticking to the skin. It’s best to only use water while cleaning the skin around your stoma. If you do use soap, be sure to rinse your skin well.\n \n  If you shower, you can remove your pouch, but it's not necessary and not usually recommended. If you take a bath, it's recommended to leave the pouch in place. One big reason not to remove your pouch when you shower or bathe is to avoid the risk of fecal output happening, which of course you cannot control.\n \n  Spots of blood on the stoma\n \n  Spots of blood are not a cause for alarm. Cleaning around the stoma as you change the pouch or skin barrier may cause slight bleeding. The blood vessels in the tissues of the stoma are very delicate at the surface and are easily disturbed. The bleeding will usually stop quickly. If it doesn’t, call your ostomy nurse or your doctor.\n \n  Shaving hair under the pouch\n \n  Having a lot of hair around the stoma can make it hard to get the skin barrier to stick well and may cause pain when you remove it. Shaving with a razor or trimming hair with scissors is helpful. Extra care should always be taken when doing this. It’s recommended that you dry shave the skin around your stoma with stoma powder, since soap and shaving creams have lotions and oils that may cause the skin barrier not to stick. After shaving, rinse well and dry the skin well before applying your pouch. \n \n  What to wear when you have a ileostomy\n \n  You will not need special clothes for everyday wear. Ostomy pouches are fairly flat and hard to see under most clothing. The pressure of elastic undergarments won’t harm the stoma or prevent bowel function.\n \n  If you were sick before surgery, you may find you can now eat normally for the first time in years. As your appetite returns, you may gain weight. This can affect the clothes you choose more than the pouching system itself.\n \n  Snug undergarments such as cotton stretch underpants, t-shirts, or camisoles may give you extra support, security, and help conceal pouches. A simple pouch cover adds comfort by absorbing body sweat and keeps the plastic pouch from resting against your skin. Men can wear either boxer or jockey-type shorts. \n \n  Managing ostomy problems\n \n  Gas (flatulence)\n \n  Right after surgery it may seem that you have a lot of gas almost all the time. Most abdominal surgery is followed by this uncomfortable, embarrassing, yet harmless symptom. Gassy noises or stomach rumblings may be a concern. If you are concerned about others nearby hearing this, you can say, “Excuse me, my stomach’s growling.” If you feel as though you are about to release gas when you’re with people, casually fold your arms across your belly so that your forearm rests over your stoma. This will muffle most sounds. Check with your ostomy nurse about products you can take to help lessen gas. Certain foods may cause gas, such as eggs, cabbage, broccoli, onions, fish, beans, milk, cheese, carbonated drinks, and alcohol.\n \n   \n   Eating regularly will help prevent gas.\n \n   Eat smaller amounts of food 4 to 5 times a day.    \n \n   skip meals to avoid gas or output.   \n \n  \n \n  Odor\n \n  Many factors, such as foods, normal bacteria in your intestine, illness, certain medicines, and vitamins can cause odor.\n \n   \n   Some foods can produce odor: eggs, cabbage, cheese, cucumber, onion, garlic, fish, dairy foods, and coffee are among them. If you find that certain foods bother you, avoid them.\n \n   Use an odor-resistant pouch.\n \n   Check to see that the skin barrier is stuck securely to your skin.\n \n   Empty the pouch often.\n \n   Place special deodorant liquids and/or tablets in the pouch.\n \n   There are some medicines you can take that may help. Check with your doctor or ostomy nurse about these products and how to use them. Some things that many people have found help with odor are chlorophyll tablets, bismuth subgallate, and bismuth subcarbonate. Keeping air deodorizers in that room can also control odor very well when you are emptying the pouch.\n \n  \n \n  Finding medicine capsules in your pouch\n \n  Be aware that coated tablets or time-released capsules may come out whole in the pouch. In most cases, this means you didn’t get the medicine. If you notice this, talk with your health care provider or pharmacist. There may be other medicines you can use to make sure you’re getting what you need. Liquid or liquid gel medicines tend to absorb faster and may work better for you.\n \n  Severe skin problems\n \n  Large areas of skin that are red, sore, and weeping (always wet) will keep you from getting a good seal around your stoma. It’s important to treat minor irritations right away. If you have a large irritated area, or one that’s getting larger despite special care, contact your doctor or ostomy nurse. They may prescribe medicine to take by mouth or to put around your ostomy to help dry out and heal your skin.\n \n  For deep pressure ulcers caused by a very tight ostomy belt, loosen or remove the belt and call your doctor or ostomy nurse right away. You will need treatment.\n \n  Blockage (obstruction)\n \n  There will be times when your ostomy does not have output for short periods of time. This is normal. But, if your stoma is not active for 4 to 6 hours and you have cramps, pain, and/or nausea, the intestine could be blocked (the medical word is obstructed\n). Call your doctor or ostomy nurse right away if this happens.\n \n  These are some things you can do to help move things through your ostomy:\n \n   \n   Watch for swelling of the stoma and adjust the opening of the skin barrier as needed until the swelling goes down.\n \n   Take a warm bath to relax your abdominal muscles.\n \n   Fluids can be taken if there is some stool output: avoid solid foods\n \n   Sometimes changing your position, such as drawing your knees up to your chest, may help move along the food in your gut.\n \n   Do  take a laxative.\n \n  \n \n  Foods high in fiber such as cabbage, greens, celery, pineapple, nuts, coconut, and corn can cause obstruction. Obstruction can also be caused by internal changes such as adhesions (scar tissue that forms inside your abdomen after surgery).\n \n  If you keep having pain and cramping with no output from your stoma for more than 2 hours, and you can’t reach your doctor or ostomy nurse, go to the emergency room. Take all your ostomy supplies with you.\n \n  Diarrhea\n \n  Diarrhea is usually a warning that something isn’t right. Diarrhea is defined as frequent loose or watery bowel movements in greater amounts than usual. It happens when food passes through the small intestine too quickly for fluids and electrolytes to be absorbed. It can come on suddenly and may cause cramps. It can cause your body to lose a lot of fluids and electrolytes. You must quickly replace these electrolytes to avoid getting sick from dehydration and mineral loss. (See Electrolyte imbalance below for more on this.)\n \n  Loose stool can also come from eating certain foods, but it usually only lasts a short time. Raw fruits and vegetables, milk, fruit juice, prune juice, or impure drinking water are examples of things that may change your stoma output. Emotional stress might also cause loose stool. Some people with ileostomies may always have “watery discharge,” and this is normal for them.\n \n  Several things can cause diarrhea:\n \n   \n   Intestinal infection or food poisoning, which may also cause fever and/or vomiting\n \n   Antibiotics and other prescription medicines\n \n   Partial blockage, which also causes smelly discharge, cramps, forceful liquid output, and a lot of noises from the stoma. It can be caused by food or other factors. Get medical help if this happens to you.\n \n  \n \n  Talk with your doctor or ostomy nurse if you have ongoing diarrhea. Discuss the foods and liquids you take in, your eating schedule, how much you usually eat, and any medicines you might be taking. You may be given medicine to help slow things down. Remember, no matter what, you need a well-balanced diet and good fluid intake to have a good output.\n \n  Electrolyte imbalance\n \n  Electrolytes are salts and minerals in the blood, like potassium, magnesium, and sodium. Keeping them balanced is important. When the colon (large intestine) is removed, you’re at a greater risk for electrolyte imbalance. Diarrhea, vomiting, and a lot of sweating can increase this risk.\n \n  Dehydration is also a serious concern. Symptoms include increased thirst, dry mouth, decreased urine output, feeling light-headed, and feeling tired. If you get dehydrated, you’ll need to drink more fluids. To avoid dehydration, you should try to drink 8 to 10 eight-ounce glasses of fluid a day. If you have diarrhea, you may need more. Drinks such as Gatorade, PowerAde, or Pedialyte contain potassium and sodium. But any liquid containing water (soda, milk, juice, tea, etc.) helps to meet your daily need for fluid.\n \n  Loss of appetite, drowsiness, and leg cramps may be signs of sodium loss. Fatigue, muscle weakness, and shortness of breath may be signs of potassium loss. Dehydration, low sodium, and low potassium can all be dangerous and should be treated right away. Keep in mind that some of these symptoms can be caused by other problems which may be emergencies. Call your doctor or 911 right away if you are dizzy, weak, or having other serious symptoms.\n \n  Phantom rectum\n \n  Phantom rectum is much like the “phantom limb” of amputees who feel as if their removed limb is still there. It’s normal for you to have the urge to move your bowels the way you did before surgery. This can happen at any time and may go on for years after surgery. If the rectum has not been removed, you may have this feeling and also may pass mucus when sitting on the toilet. Some people who have had their rectum removed say that the feeling is helped by sitting on the toilet and acting as if a bowel movement is taking place.\n \n  Short bowel syndrome\n \n  This condition happens when surgery is done to remove a large part of the small intestine. Short bowel syndrome needs special attention because there’s not enough intestine left to absorb the nutrients the body needs.\n \n  People with short bowel syndrome must be under a doctor’s care. They must be closely watched to make sure they’re taking in enough calories, carbohydrates, proteins, fats, vitamins, and minerals. They can live a normal life, but must be careful to avoid diarrhea, and be within quick reach of medical care. The shorter the small intestine, the more watery the discharge will be. This may reduce the time a pouch can be worn because the skin barrier breaks down more rapidly.\n \n  When you should call the doctor\n \n  You should call the doctor or ostomy nurse if you have:\n \n   \n   Cramps lasting more than 2 or 3 hours\n \n   Continuous nausea and vomiting\n \n   No ostomy output for 4 to 6 hours with cramping and nausea\n \n   Severe watery discharge lasting more than 5 or 6 hours\n \n   Bad odor lasting more than a week (This may be a sign of infection.)\n \n   A cut in the stoma\n \n   Injury to the stoma\n \n   Bad skin irritation or deep sores (ulcers)\n \n   A lot of bleeding from the stoma opening,or a moderate amount in the pouch that you notice several times when emptying it (NOTE: Eating beets will cause some red discoloration.)\n \n   Continuous bleeding where the stoma meets the skin\n \n   Unusual change in your stoma size or color\n \n   Anything unusual going on with your ostomy \n \n  \n \n  Ordering and storing ostomy supplies\n \n  Supplies may be ordered from a mail order company, from a medical supply store, a local pharmacy, or online. For additional help ordering, try contacting the product manufacturer, check your local phone book’s business pages, or check the Internet (try searching for “ostomy supplies”).\n \n   \n   To order pouches, skin barriers, and other ostomy products, you’ll need both the: and \n \n   Talk with your ostomy nurse about reputable dealers who can supply you with what you need \n \n   Before ordering your supplies, check with your health insurance to be sure that they work with the company in question   \n \n   Compare prices when using mail order and the Internet (remember to include shipping costs) \n \n   Keep all your supplies together on a shelf, in a drawer, or in a box in a dry area away from moisture and hot or cold temperatures. \n \n   Order supplies a few weeks before you expect them to run out to allow enough time for delivery. DO NOT stockpile supplies – they can be ruined by moisture and temperature changes.\n"

        "text": "Ovarian cancer\n\n        \n     \n\n        \nOvarian cancer is cancer that starts in the ovaries. The ovaries are the female reproductive organs that produce eggs.\nCauses\n\n          \nOvarian cancer is the fifth most common cancer among women. It causes more deaths than any other type of female reproductive organ cancer.\nThe cause of ovarian cancer is unknown.\nRisks of developing ovarian cancer include any of the following: \nThe fewer children a woman has and the later in life she gives birth, the higher her risk for ovarian cancer.\nWomen who have had breast cancer or have a family history of breast or ovarian cancer have an increased risk for ovarian cancer (due to defects in genes such as BRCA1 or BRCA2 ).\nWomen who take estrogen replacement only (not with progesterone) for 5 years or more may have a higher risk for ovarian cancer. Birth control pills, though, decrease the risk for ovarian cancer.\nFertility medicine probably does not increase the risk for ovarian cancer.\nOlder women are at highest risk of developing ovarian cancer. Most deaths from ovarian cancer occur in women age 55 and older. \nSymptoms\n\n          \nOvarian cancer symptoms are often vague. Women and their doctors often blame the symptoms on other, more common conditions. By the time the cancer is diagnosed, the tumor has often spread beyond the ovaries.\nSee your doctor if you have the following symptoms on a daily basis for more than a few weeks:\nBloating or swelling in the belly area\nDifficulty eating or feeling full quickly (early satiety)\nPelvic or lower abdominal pain (area may feel \"heavy\")\nBack pain\nSwollen lymph nodes in groin \nOther symptoms that can occur:\nExcessive hair growth that is coarse and dark\nSudden urge to urinate\nNeeding to urinate more often than usual (increased urinary frequency or urgency)\nConstipation \nExams and Tests\n\n          \nA physical exam may often be normal. With advanced ovarian cancer, the doctor may find a swollen abdomen often due to accumulation of fluid (ascites). \nA pelvic examination may reveal an ovarian or abdominal mass.\nA CA-125 blood test is not considered a good screening test for ovarian cancer. But, it may be done if a woman has:\nSymptoms of ovarian cancer\nAlready been diagnosed with ovarian cancer to determine how well treatment is working \nOther tests that may be done include:\nComplete blood count and blood chemistry\nCT or MRI of the pelvis or abdomen\nUltrasound of the pelvis \nSurgery, such as laparoscopy or exploratory laparotomy, is often done to find the cause of symptoms. A biopsy will be done to help make the diagnosis.\nNo lab or imaging test has ever been shown to be able to successfully screen for or diagnose ovarian cancer in its early stages, so no standard screening tests are recommended at this time.\nTreatment\n\n          \nSurgery is used to treat all stages of ovarian cancer. For early stages, surgery may be the only treatment needed. Surgery may involve removing both ovaries and fallopian tubes, the uterus, or other structures in the belly or pelvis.The goals of surgery for ovarian cancer are:\nSample normal appearing areas to see if the cancer has spread (staging)\nRemove any areas of tumor spread (debulking)\nChemotherapy is used after surgery to treat any cancer that remains. Chemotherapy can also be used if the cancer comes back (relapses). Chemotherapy is typically given intravenously (through an IV). It can also be injected directly into the abdominal cavity (intraperitoneal, or IP).\nRadiation therapy is rarely used to treat ovarian cancer.\nAfter surgery and chemotherapy, follow instructions about how often you should see your doctor and the tests you should have.\nSupport Groups\n\n          \nYou can ease the stress of illness by joining a cancer support group. Sharing with others who have common experiences and problems can help you not feel alone.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\n\n          \nOvarian cancer is rarely diagnosed in its early stages. It is usually quite advanced by the time diagnosis is made:\nNearly one half of women live longer than 5 years after diagnosis\nIf diagnosis is made early in the disease and treatment is received before the cancer spreads outside the ovary, the 5-year survival rate is high \nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\n\n          \nContact your health care provider if you are a woman 40 years or older who has not recently had a pelvic exam. Routine pelvic exams are recommended for all women 20 years or older.\nCall for an appointment with your provider if you have symptoms of ovarian cancer.\nPrevention\n\n          \nThere are no standard recommendations for screening women without symptoms (asymptomatic) for ovarian cancer. Pelvic ultrasound or a blood test, such as CA-125, have not been found to be effective and are not recommended.\nGenetic testing for the BRCA1 or BRCA2, or other cancer-related genes, may be recommended for women at high risk for ovarian cancer. These are women who have a personal or family history of breast or ovarian cancer.\nRemoving the ovaries and fallopian tubes and possibly the uterus in women who have a proven mutation in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene may reduce the risk of developing ovarian cancer. But, ovarian cancer may still develop in other areas of the pelvis.\nAlternative Names\n\n    \nCancer - ovaries\nPatient Instructions\n\n      \nImages\n\n      \nFemale reproductive anatomy\nAscites with ovarian cancer - CT scan\nPeritoneal and ovarian cancer, CT scan\nOvarian cancer dangers\nOvarian growth worries\nUterus\nOvarian cancer\nOvarian cancer metastasis\nReferences\n\n    \nColeman RL, Liu J, Matsuo K, Thaker PH, Westin SN, Sood AK.

By preventing cancer, the number of new cases of cancer \n         in a group or population is lowered. Hopefully, this will lower \n         the number of deaths caused by cancer.\nTo prevent new cancers from starting, scientists look at risk \n         factors and protective factors. Anything that increases your \n         chance of developing cancer is called a cancer risk factor; \n         anything that decreases your chance of developing cancer is \n         called a cancer protective factor.\nSome risk factors for cancer can be avoided, but many cannot. \n         For example, both smoking and inheriting certain genes are \n         risk factors for some types of cancer, but only smoking can be \n         avoided. Regular exercise and a healthy diet may be protective \n         factors for some types of cancer. Avoiding risk factors and \n         increasing protective factors may lower your risk but it does \n         not mean that you will not get cancer.\nDifferent ways to prevent cancer are being studied, including:\nChanging lifestyle or eating habits.\nAvoiding things known to cause cancer.\nTaking medicines to treat a precancerous condition or to \n         keep cancer from starting.\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n        General Information About Ovarian, Fallopian Tube, and Primary Peritoneal Cancer\n\n        Key Points\nOvarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancers are diseases in which malignant (cancer) cells\n\t\t  form in the  ovaries, fallopian tubes, or peritoneum.\nOvarian cancer is the leading cause of death from cancer of the\n\t\t  female reproductive system. \nOvarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancers are diseases in which malignant (cancer) cells\n\t\t  form in the  ovaries, fallopian tubes, or peritoneum.\nThe ovaries are a pair\n\t\t  of organs in the female reproductive\n\t\t  system. They are in the pelvis, one on each side of the\n\t\t  uterus (the hollow, pear-shaped\n\t\t  organ where a fetus grows). Each\n\t\t  ovary is about the size and shape of an almond. The ovaries  make eggs and\n\t\t  female hormones (chemicals that\n\t\t  control the way certain cells or\n\t\t  organs  work in the body).\nThe fallopian tubes are a pair of long, slender tubes, one on each side of the uterus. Eggs pass from the ovaries, through the fallopian tubes, to the uterus. Cancer sometimes begins at the end of the fallopian tube near the ovary and spreads to the ovary.\nThe  peritoneum is the tissue that lines the abdominal wall and covers organs in the abdomen. Primary peritoneal cancer is cancer that forms in the peritoneum and has not spread there from another part of the body. Cancer sometimes begins in the peritoneum and spreads to the ovary. \nOvarian cancer is the leading cause of death from cancer of the\n\t\t  female reproductive system. \n  Ovarian cancer is most common in postmenopausal women. From the mid-1980s to 2017, the number  of new cases of ovarian cancer decreased slightly each year. There was also a slight decrease in the number  of deaths from ovarian cancer each year from 2009 to 2018.\nWomen who have a family history of ovarian cancer and/or certain inherited gene changes, such as BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene changes, have a higher risk than women who do not have a family history or who have not inherited these gene changes. For  women with inherited risk, genetic counseling and genetic testing can be  used to find out more about how likely they are to develop  ovarian cancer.\nIt is hard to find ovarian cancer early. Early ovarian cancer may not cause any symptoms. When symptoms do appear, ovarian cancer is often advanced.\nSee the following PDQ summaries for more information about ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancers:\nGenetics of Breast and Gynecologic Cancers (written for health professionals)\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n        Ovarian, Fallopian Tube, and Primary Peritoneal Cancer Prevention\n\n        Key Points\nAvoiding risk factors and increasing protective factors may\n\t\t  help prevent cancer.\nThe following are risk\n factors for ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancer:Family history of ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancer\nInherited risk\nHormone replacement therapy\n Weight and height\nEndometriosis\nThe following are protective\n factors  for ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancer:Oral contraceptives\nTubal ligation\nGiving birth\nSalpingectomy\nBreastfeeding\nRisk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy\nIt is not clear whether the  following  affect the risk of ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancer:Diet\nAlcohol\nAspirin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs\nTalc\nInfertility treatment\nCancer prevention clinical trials are used to study ways \n    to prevent cancer.\n\n      \n     New ways to prevent ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancer are being studied in clinical \n     trials. \nAvoiding risk factors and increasing protective factors may\n\t\t  help prevent cancer.\nAvoiding cancer risk factors may help prevent certain cancers. Risk factors include smoking, being overweight, and not getting enough exercise.  Increasing protective factors such as quitting smoking and exercising may also help prevent some cancers. Talk to your doctor or other health care professional about how you might lower your risk of cancer.\nThe following are risk\n factors for ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancer:\nFamily history of ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancer\nA woman whose mother or sister  had ovarian cancer has an increased risk of ovarian cancer. A woman with two or  more relatives with ovarian cancer also has an increased risk of ovarian cancer. \n\nInherited risk\nThe risk of ovarian cancer is increased in women who have inherited certain changes in the BRCA1, BRCA2, or other genes.\nThe risk of ovarian cancer is also increased in women who have certain inherited syndromes that include:\n\tFamilial site-specific ovarian cancer syndrome.\n\tFamilial breast/ovarian cancer syndrome.\nHereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC; Lynch syndrome).\nHormone replacement therapy\nThere is a slightly increased risk of ovarian cancer in women who are taking hormone replacement therapy (HRT) after menopause. There is also an increased risk of ovarian cancer in women who have recently used HRT, even if they used it for less than 5 years. The risk of ovarian cancer is the same for HRT with estrogen only or with combined estrogen and progestin. \nWhen HRT is stopped, the risk of ovarian cancer decreases over time.\nThe risk of ovarian cancer is not affected by the age of the woman when taking HRT.\n Weight and height\nBeing overweight or having obesity is linked to an increased risk of ovarian cancer. Obesity is also linked to an increased risk of death from ovarian cancer. Being tall may also be linked to a slight increase in the risk of ovarian cancer.\nEndometriosis\nWomen who have endometriosis have an increased risk of ovarian cancer.\nThe following are protective\n factors  for ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancer:\nOral contraceptives\n Taking oral contraceptives (“the pill”) lowers the risk of ovarian\n\t\t\t cancer. The longer oral contraceptives are used, the lower the risk may\n\t\t\t be. The decrease in risk may last up to 30 years after a woman has stopped taking oral\n\t\t\t contraceptives. \nTaking  oral contraceptives increases the risk of blood clots. This risk is higher in women who also smoke. \nTubal ligation\n The risk of ovarian cancer is decreased in  women who have a tubal ligation (surgery to close both fallopian tubes). \nGiving birth\nWomen who have given birth have a decreased risk of ovarian cancer compared to women who have not given birth. Giving birth to more than one child further decreases the risk of ovarian cancer. \nSalpingectomy\nSome studies have shown that salpingectomy (surgery to remove one or both fallopian tubes) is linked with a decreased risk of ovarian cancer.  When both fallopian tubes are removed, the risk of ovarian cancer is lowered more than when one fallopian tube is removed.\nBreastfeeding\nBreastfeeding is  linked to a decreased risk of ovarian cancer. The longer a woman breastfeeds, the lower her risk of ovarian cancer. Women who breastfeed for at least 8 to 10 months have the greatest decrease in risk of ovarian cancer.\nRisk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy\nSome women who have a high risk of ovarian cancer may choose to have a risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (surgery to remove the fallopian tubes and ovaries when there are no signs of cancer).  This includes women who have inherited certain changes in the BRCA1\n and BRCA2\n genes or have an inherited syndrome. (See the  Risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO) section in the PDQ health professional summary on Genetics of Breast and Gynecologic Cancers for more information.)\nIt is very important  to have a cancer risk\n\t\t\t assessment and counseling before making this decision.  These and other factors may be discussed:\nInfertility.\n\tEarly menopause: The drop in estrogen levels caused by removing the ovaries can cause early menopause. Symptoms of menopause  can worsen and include the following: Hot flashes.\nNight sweats.\nTrouble sleeping.\nMood changes.\nDecreased sex drive.\nHeart disease.\nVaginal dryness.\nFrequent urination.\nOsteoporosis (decreased bone density).\nThese symptoms may not be the same in all women. Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) may be used to lessen these symptoms.\nRisk of ovarian cancer in the peritoneum:  Women who have had a  risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy continue to have a small risk of  ovarian cancer in the peritoneum (thin layer of tissue that lines the inside of the abdomen). This is rare, but may occur if  ovarian cancer cells  had already spread to  the peritoneum before the surgery or if some ovarian tissue remains after surgery.\nIt is not clear whether the  following  affect the risk of ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancer:\nDiet\nStudies of dietary factors have not found a strong link to ovarian cancer.\nAlcohol\nStudies have not shown a link between  drinking alcohol and  the risk of  ovarian cancer.\nAspirin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs\nSome studies of aspirin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have found a decreased risk of ovarian cancer and others have not. \nTalc\nStudies of women who used talcum powder (talc) dusted on the perineum (the area between the vagina and the anus) have not found clear evidence of an increased risk of ovarian cancer. \nInfertility treatment\nOverall, studies in women using  fertility drugs have not found clear evidence of an increased\n\t\t\t\trisk of ovarian cancer.  The risk of invasive ovarian cancer may be higher in women who do not get pregnant after taking fertility drugs.\nCancer prevention clinical trials are used to study ways \n    to prevent cancer.\nCancer prevention clinical trials are used to study ways to \n         lower the risk of developing certain types of cancer. Some \n         cancer prevention trials are conducted with healthy people who \n         have not had cancer but who have an increased risk for cancer. \n         Other prevention trials are conducted with people who have had \n         cancer and are trying to prevent another cancer of the same type \n         or to lower their chance of developing a new type of cancer. \n         Other trials are done with healthy volunteers who are not known \n         to have any risk factors for cancer.\nThe purpose of some cancer prevention clinical trials is to \n         find out whether actions people take can prevent cancer. These \n         may include eating fruits and vegetables, exercising, quitting \n         smoking, or taking certain medicines,  vitamins,  minerals, or \n         food supplements.\n\n      \n     New ways to prevent ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancer are being studied in clinical \n     trials. \nInformation about clinical trials supported by NCI can be found on NCI’s clinical trials search webpage. Clinical trials supported by other organizations can be found on the ClinicalTrials.gov website.\n",

The PDQ database contains summaries of the latest published information on cancer prevention, detection, genetics, treatment, supportive care, and complementary and alternative medicine. Most summaries come in two versions. The health professional versions have detailed information written in technical language. The patient versions are written in easy-to-understand, nontechnical language. Both versions have cancer information that is accurate and up to date and most versions are also available in Spanish.\nPDQ is a service of the NCI. The NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). NIH is the federal government’s center of biomedical research.  The PDQ summaries are based on an independent review of the medical literature. They are not policy statements of the NCI or the NIH.\nPurpose of This Summary\nThis PDQ cancer information summary has current information about ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancer prevention.  It is meant to inform and help patients, families, and caregivers. It does not give formal guidelines or recommendations for making decisions about health care.\nReviewers and Updates\nEditorial Boards write the PDQ cancer information summaries and keep them up to date. These Boards are made up of experts in cancer treatment and other specialties related to cancer. The summaries are reviewed regularly and changes are made when there is new information. The date on each summary (\"Updated\") is the date of the most recent change.\nThe information in this patient summary was taken from the health professional version, which is reviewed regularly and updated as needed, by the PDQ Screening and Prevention Editorial Board.\nClinical Trial Information\nA clinical trial is a study to answer a scientific question, such as whether one treatment is better than another. Trials are based on past studies and what has been learned in the laboratory. Each trial answers certain scientific questions in order to find new and better ways to help cancer patients. During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works. If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become \"standard.\" Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.\nClinical trials can be found online at NCI's website.

        "text": "Prophylactic oophorectomy: Preventing cancer by surgically removing your ovaries\n\n\n\n                    \n                \n\n                \n                    \n\nProphylactic oophorectomy (oh-of-uh-REK-tuh-me) significantly reduces your odds of developing breast cancer and ovarian cancer if you're at high risk. Weigh the pros and cons of this cancer prevention option.\nBy Mayo Clinic Staff\n\n\nPreventive surgery to remove the ovaries might be an option that people with a high risk of ovarian cancer and breast cancer might consider to reduce their risk. Preventive (prophylactic) bilateral oophorectomy carries benefits and risks that must be carefully balanced when considering this procedure.\nIn an oophorectomy, a surgeon removes both your ovaries — the almond-shaped organs on each side of your uterus. Your ovaries contain eggs and secrete the hormones that control your reproductive cycle.\nIf you haven't experienced menopause, removing your ovaries greatly reduces the amount of the hormones estrogen and progesterone circulating in your body. This surgery can halt or slow breast cancers that need these hormones to grow.\nWomen with BRCA gene mutations usually also have their fallopian tubes removed at the same time the ovaries are removed (risk-reducing bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy) since they have an increased risk of fallopian tube cancer as well.\nPreventive surgery for people with Lynch syndrome, also known as hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer, may also include removing the uterus (hysterectomy) since they have an increased risk of endometrial cancer.\nProphylactic oophorectomy is usually reserved for those with:\n\n    \n     People with a significantly increased risk of breast cancer and ovarian cancer due to an inherited mutation in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene — two genes linked to breast cancer, ovarian cancer and other cancers who have completed childbearing may consider this procedure.\n\n    People with other inherited gene mutations that increase the risk of ovarian cancer, including those with Lynch syndrome, might also consider this procedure.\n\n    \n\n     Prophylactic oophorectomy may also be recommended if you have a strong family history of breast cancer and ovarian cancer but no known genetic alteration. It might also be recommended if you have a strong likelihood of carrying the gene mutation based on your family history but choose not to proceed with genetic testing.\nDiscuss your risk factors for breast cancer and ovarian cancer with your doctor. Your doctor may recommend that you see a genetic counselor to discuss your family history of cancer to help you decide whether you should consider genetic testing and which genes should be included in the testing.\nIf you have a BRCA mutation, a prophylactic oophorectomy can reduce your:\n\n    \n     As an example, if a woman with a high risk of breast cancer had a 60 percent chance of being diagnosed with breast cancer at some point in her lifetime, bilateral oophorectomy could reduce her risk to 30 percent.\n\n    Put another way, for every 100 women just like her, 60 could be expected to be diagnosed with breast cancer without oophorectomy. And 30 would be expected to be diagnosed with breast cancer after oophorectomy.\n\n    \n\n    \n     As an example, if a woman with a high risk of ovarian cancer had a 30 percent chance of being diagnosed with ovarian cancer at some point in her lifetime, oophorectomy could reduce her risk to 6 percent, assuming an 80 percent risk reduction.\n\n    Put another way, for every 100 women just like her, 30 could be expected to be diagnosed with ovarian cancer without oophorectomy. And six would be expected to be diagnosed with ovarian cancer after oophorectomy.\n\n    \nIn studies, the risk of breast cancer and ovarian cancer varies according to the particular gene mutations that you have. And your individual risk of breast cancer and ovarian cancer varies depending on many factors, including your age, your family history, your lifestyle choices and other strategies you're using to reduce your risk of cancer.\nFor some, oophorectomy may offer great reduction in risk. For others, the risks of surgery and the potential side effects may not be worth the reduction in cancer risk.\nOophorectomy is a generally safe procedure that carries a small risk of complications, including infection, intestinal blockage and injury to internal organs. The risk of complications depends on how the procedure is performed.\nBut more concerning is the impact of losing the hormones supplied by your ovaries. If you have yet to undergo menopause, oophorectomy causes early menopause. Early menopause carries many risks, including:\n\n     Removing your ovaries reduces the amount of bone-building estrogen your body produces. This may increase your risk of a broken bone.\n\n     Hot flashes, vaginal dryness, sexual problems, sleep disturbance and sometimes cognitive changes can occur during menopause. Removing your ovaries doesn't mean you'll immediately have these problems, but it does mean that any menopausal symptoms you develop will occur earlier and are more likely to reduce your quality of life than if they occurred during natural menopause.\n\n     Your risk of heart disease may increase if you have your ovaries removed.\n\n     Prophylactic oophorectomy doesn't completely eliminate your risk of breast cancer or ovarian cancer. A type of cancer that looks and acts identical to ovarian cancer can develop after the ovaries and fallopian tubes are removed. The risk of this type of cancer, called primary peritoneal cancer, is low — much lower than the lifetime risk of ovarian cancer if the ovaries remain intact.\nProphylactic oophorectomy might relieve much of your anxiety about developing cancer, but this type of surgery can also take an emotional toll on you. Even if you didn't plan on having children, you might mourn the loss of your fertility.\nUse of low-dose hormone therapy after oophorectomy is controversial. While studies have shown that use of hormone therapy after menopause may increase the risk of breast cancer, other studies suggest early menopause can cause its own serious risks.\nWomen who undergo prophylactic oophorectomy and don't use hormone therapy up to age 45 have a higher rate of premature death, heart disease and neurological diseases. For this reason, doctors typically recommend that younger women who have surgically induced menopause should consider taking low-dose hormone therapy for a short time and stop around age 51.\nIt isn't entirely clear what effect hormone therapy might have on your cancer risk. Several studies have found that short-term hormone therapy doesn't increase the risk of breast cancer in those with BRCA mutations who have undergone prophylactic oophorectomy. Ask your doctor about your particular situation. If you decide to take low-dose estrogen, plan to discontinue this treatment around age 51.\nYou may opt to have your uterus removed during your oophorectomy surgery so that you can take a type of hormone therapy (estrogen-only hormone therapy) that may be safer for those with a high risk of breast cancer. Discuss the benefits and risks of hysterectomy with your surgeon.\nResearchers are studying other ways to reduce the risk of ovarian cancer in people who have a high risk of the disease. But these other ways of preventing ovarian cancer haven't been proved to reduce risk as much as oophorectomy has. For this reason, most doctors recommend oophorectomy.\nBut oophorectomy isn't right for everyone with a high risk of breast cancer or ovarian cancer. So talk about the alternatives with your doctor to better understand how they may affect your risk. Options include:\n\n    \n     You may choose to have ovarian cancer screening once or twice each year to look for early signs of cancer. Screening usually includes a blood test for cancer antigen (CA) 125 and an ultrasound exam of your ovaries.\n\n    In theory, increased screening should be able to help doctors catch ovarian cancer at its earliest stages, but whether that's possible with current screening methods isn't clear. Screening tests are noninvasive, but there's no evidence that they save lives.\n\n    \n\n    \n     Studies suggest that taking birth control pills reduces the risk of ovarian cancer in average-risk women. There is good evidence that birth control pills can also be beneficial in high-risk women, such as those with BRCA mutations.\n\n    There is concern that newer birth control pill formulations are associated with a very small increase in the risk of breast cancer. However, the benefits of reducing ovarian cancer risk seem to outweigh the small risk of breast cancer.\n\n    \nYes. Surgery to remove your breasts (bilateral mastectomy) may reduce your risk of breast cancer by 90 percent. As an example, if your risk of developing breast cancer at some point in your lifetime is 50 percent, a preventive mastectomy may lower your risk to 5 percent.\nPut another way, for every 100 women with that same level of risk who undergo preventive mastectomy, five could be diagnosed with breast cancer at some point in their lives.\nReasons you might choose oophorectomy over mastectomy include:\n\n     For those that haven't yet experienced menopause, oophorectomy reduces the risk of breast cancer and ovarian cancer, while mastectomy reduces only the risk of breast cancer.\n\n     Ovarian cancer is sometimes seen as a greater threat than breast cancer because it isn't easily detected, and it may be detected at a later stage when diagnosed. While there's no proven method for finding ovarian cancer at an early stage, there are tests, such as mammograms and breast MRIs, to detect breast cancer at an early stage in very high-risk women.\n\n     Some women are concerned about how they'll look if they have their breasts removed. Oophorectomy won't affect your appearance.\nThese benefits have to be balanced against the risks of oophorectomy and the early menopause that occurs as a result.\nThe decision to have prophylactic oophorectomy is a challenging and difficult one with no clearly right or wrong answer. It comes down to a personal choice you alone can make, but advice from a genetic counselor, a breast health specialist or a gynecologic oncologist can help you make a more informed decision.\nQuestions to ask your doctor or other health care provider include:\n\n    What is my risk of breast cancer?\n\n    What is my risk of ovarian cancer?\n\n    What are my options to lower my risk of breast cancer?\n\n    What are my options to lower my risk of ovarian cancer?\n\n    What are the benefits and risks of each option?\n\n    What are some good sources of information about reducing my cancer risk?\n\n    How much time can I take to research my options and make a decision?\n\n    If I decide that prophylactic oophorectomy isn't right for me right now, can I change my mind later?\n\n    What advice would you give your friend or family member if she were in my situation?\nDetermining whether prophylactic oophorectomy is right for you — and when it might be right for you — depends on your individual risk of cancer and how aggressive you want to be in your cancer prevention efforts.\n\n\nShow References\n\n    Muto MG.

It is important to talk with several cancer specialists, including a radiation oncologist, surgeon and medical oncologist, before deciding on the best treatment for you, your cancer and your lifestyle. Sometimes, your cancer may be treated by using only one type of treatment. In other cases, your cancer may be best treated using a combination of surgery, radiation therapy and chemotherapy.\nRadiation Therapy\nRadiation therapy, sometimes called radiotherapy, is the careful use of radiation to treat cancer safely and effectively. Radiation oncologists use radiation therapy to try to cure cancer, control cancer growth or relieve symptoms, such as pain.\n\nRadiation therapy works within cancer cells by damaging their ability to multiply. When these cells die, the body naturally eliminates them. Healthy cells are also affected by radiation, but they can repair themselves in a way that cancer cells cannot.\n\n\nThere are two types of radiation therapy. External beam radiation therapy directs radiation beams at the cancer from outside your body. Internal radiation therapy, or brachytherapy, is delivered with radioactive sources that are temporarily placed into the vagina, uterus and/or surrounding tissues to kill the cancer cells.\n\n\nSurgery\nSurgery is an important part of treatment for many tumors of the female reproductive system. A gynecologic oncologist is a doctor who specializes in surgically removing and treating gynecologic cancers.\n\nFor uterine and cervical cancers, surgery usually involves the removal of the uterus and cervix, called a hysterectomy. The surgeon may also remove lymph nodes and check for any cancer cells within the fluid within the abdomen. For less common tumors like vulvar cancer,surgery is more likely to involve removing part or all of the vulva and sampling lymph nodes.\n\n\nSurgery and radiation can be combined to help lower the risk of recurrence of cancer after surgery, but this strategy varies based upon the disease and stage (how much the tumor seems to have spread).\n\n\nIn cases where radiation is the main treatment, it is often still important to keep your surgeon involved in follow-up after radiation to monitor for signs of recurrence.\n\n\nMedical Therapy\n\nAnti-cancer drugs known as chemotherapy have been proven to improve cancer cure rates in certain gynecologic cancer patients. These medications are used in a variety of different cancers and tend to be used for stage III and IV gynecologic cancers. The dose and schedule for treatment varies, and chemotherapy can be done either alone or with radiation therapy. Because chemotherapy recommendations vary significantly depending on disease and stage, it is important to discuss this with a medical oncologist or gynecologic oncologist (surgeon). Both can prescribe chemotherapy for gynecologic cancers. Talk with your surgeon about whether you need a separate appointment with a medical oncologist for evaluation or treatment.\n\n\n\n\n                  \n                \n",

        "text": "What Is a Cancer Caregiver?\nWe define caregiver as the person who most often helps the person with cancer and is not paid to do so. Professional care providers are paid to give care. They tend to have more limited roles, and are not discussed in detail here.\nCaregivers may be partners, family members, or close friends. Most often, they’re not trained for the caregiver job. Many times, they’re the lifeline of the person with cancer.\nCaregivers have many roles. These roles change as the patient’s needs change during and after cancer treatment. Today a lot of cancer care is done in outpatient treatment centers and doctors’ offices. This means that sicker people are being cared for at home.\nAs a caregiver, you have a huge influence – both positive and negative – on how the cancer patient deals with their illness. Your encouragement can help the patient stick with a demanding treatment plan and take other steps to get well, like eating healthy meals or getting enough rest.\nCaregivers are part of the team\nThe caregiver is part of a cancer care team made up of the patient, other family and friends, and the medical staff. As a caregiver, you may find yourself working closely with the cancer care team, doing things like:\nGiving drugs\nManaging side effects\nReporting problems\nTrying to keep other family members and friends informed of what’s happening\nHelping to decide whether a treatment is working\nAs part of the team, you’ll help coordinate the patient’s care. Caregivers often have to keep track of prescriptions, know which tests are to be done, and make sure all involved doctors know what’s going on. They often find themselves preventing mix-ups and keeping track of paperwork.\nA good caregiver is a vital health care resource. In many cases, the caregiver is the one person who knows everything that’s going on with the patient. Don’t be afraid to ask questions and take notes during doctor visits. Learn who the members of the cancer care team are and know how to contact them. Getting the right support and information can help both you and your loved one with cancer.\nCaregivers are problem solvers\nThe person with cancer faces many new challenges. As the caregiver you can help the patient deal with these challenges and get through any problems that come up.\nFor example, suppose the patient’s white blood counts drop, they develop a fever, and as a result, need to be in the hospital. This can be very upsetting and may be seen as a setback by the family and the patient. The caregiver can:\nHelp address their concerns by pointing out that the patient will need to be in the hospital for only a short time until antibiotic treatment has the infection under control.\nMake sure that the patient has everything they need while in the hospital, including doctor’s prescriptions for non-cancer related medicines taken at home, such as thyroid or blood pressure medicine.\nCall all the doctors involved in the patient’s care and tell them about the infection and that the patient is in the hospital.\nCheck that arrangements have been made for the patient to stay on the antibiotics at home or as an outpatient after leaving the hospital. If daily visits to the outpatient clinic for IV (intravenous) antibiotics are needed, the caregiver can coordinate people to help the patient get there and back each day.\nThese kinds of tasks may be too much for the patient to tackle while fighting infection. This kind of help is valuable. It’s a reassuring sign for the patient that this short-term problem can be managed and solved.\nCaregivers take care of day-to-day tasks\nThere are other day-to-day tasks a caregiver might do. Here are a few things caregivers might help the person with cancer do, or in some cases even do for them:\nShop for and prepare food\nEat\nTake medicines\nBathe, groom, and dress\nUse the bathroom\nClean house and do laundry\nPay bills\nFind emotional support\nGet to and from doctor’s appointments, tests, and treatments\nManage medical problems at home\nCoordinate cancer care\nDecide when to seek health care or see a doctor for new problems\nAll of this work costs caregivers time and money. There may also be a cost to the caregiver’s health and well-being, but often the caregiver just keeps doing what needs to be done and may suffer in silence.\nYou may be glad to put the well-being of the person with cancer above your own well-being. And your love for this person may give you the energy and drive you need to help them through this difficult time. Still, no matter how you feel about it, caregiving is a hard job! And many caregivers are there for their loved one 24 hours a day for months or even years.\nCaregivers involve the patient\nGood communication with the person you are caring for is the most important part of your role. It may be hard for the patient to take part in daily planning and decision-making because they’re dealing with the physical, emotional, and social effects of cancer and treatment. Your job is to involve the patient as much as possible, so they know they’re doing their part to get better. Here are some things you can try to do to keep the patient involved:\nHelp them live as normal a life as possible. To do this you might start by helping them decide what activities are most important. They may need to put aside those that are less important in order to do the things enjoyed the most.\nEncourage them to share feelings and support their efforts to share. For instance, if they begin talking to you about their feelings about cancer, don’t change the subject. Listen and let them talk. You might want to share how you’re feeling, too.\nLet the patient know you’re available, but don’t press issues. For example, if they’re trying to do something, such as dress themselves – they might be struggling, but it’s important for them to be able to do this. You may want to do it for them, but don’t. Let them decide when they need help.\nRemember that people communicate in different ways. Try sharing by writing or by using gestures, expressions, or touch. Sometimes, it may be really hard to say what you’re feeling, but a gesture such as holding hands might show how you feel.\nTake your cues from the person with cancer. Some people are very private while others will talk more about what they’re going through. Respect the person’s need to share or his need to remain quiet.\nBe realistic and flexible about what you hope to talk about and agree on. You may need or want to talk, only to find that the patient doesn’t want to do it at that time.\nRespect the need to be alone. Sometimes, we all need time alone – even you.\nYou might find that the person you’re caring for is acting different – angry, quiet and withdrawn, or just sad. If you think they aren’t talking to you because they want to spare your feelings, make sure they know that you are always open to listening, even about tough topics. If they keep acting very sad or withdrawn, you might want to talk to the cancer care team about what could be causing it and what can be done. Learn more in Emotional, Mental Health, and Mood Changes.\nLong-distance caregiving\nCaregiving at a distance can be even harder to do and can cost more, too. The cost of time, travel, phone calls, missed work, and out-of-pocket expenses are higher when the caregiver doesn’t live close to the person needing care. Sometimes paid “on-site” caregivers are needed, and this can be another large expense.\nThere’s often increased stress and greater feelings of guilt with long-distance caregiving. You may worry, “What if something happens and I can’t get there right away?” Or, “Who’s going to make sure they ______ (take their medicine, eat, don’t fall, etc.)?” And if you do have family living close to the person with cancer, you might feel guilty that the burden falls on them and you aren’t doing your share.\nAlong with this, there’s the guilt felt while you’re with the person with cancer: “Who’s going to ______ (pick up the kids from school, cook dinner, walk the dog, etc.) at home while I’m gone?”\nYou also may feel left out of decisions made by the person with cancer and those who do live nearby. But there are things you can do to help your loved one and take an active role in their care – even when you’re far away.\nWhen you visit the patient check the house for safety issues like cluttered walkways, loose rugs, or bad lighting. Maybe grab bars in the bathroom or a shower seat would be helpful. Help make improvements or arrange for someone else to do so.\nIs the house clean? Is the yard cared for? Is there food in the house? Arranging help for chores like these can be a big help to the person with cancer.\nGet in touch with people who live near the person with cancer. This may be other family members, friends, neighbors, or the doctor. Call them. And make sure they know how to reach you.\nPlan for a crisis. Who can you count on to check on your loved one any time, day or night?\nKeep a list of all the medicines and treatments the patient is getting (include doses and schedules), and update it regularly.\nMake sure the person with cancer can reach you and others who help with care. This might mean buying a cell phone for your loved one or arranging for a long distance plan on their land line phone. You can also program important numbers into their phones. This can serve as a phone number directory and help with speed dialing.\nUse a website that lets people sign up for different jobs or tasks, such as Lotsa Helping Hands and CaringBridge. Then you can keep an eye on what’s needed and what’s being done.\nTry to plan your visits. Once you get there you may be overwhelmed by everything that needs to be done, but having a plan keeps you focused and less stressed. Talk to the patient ahead of time about what’s needed and set clear goals for your visit. And don’t forget to visit! Remember to just spend time with them and do some activities together – things that you both enjoy.\nIf other family members are doing most of the hands-on work, you can step in for them to give them some time off. Maybe you can plan a visit so they can go on vacation or just take a much-needed break.\nFrom a distance, it may be hard to feel that what you’re doing is enough or important. But sometimes the distant caregiver is the one who ties things together and keeps everything organized. You may be the one called because you know what to do or where to go for help when something is needed or a problem comes up.\n"

        "text": "How to Communicate as a Caregiver\nGood communication lets you express yourself, help others understand your limits and needs, and understand the limits and needs of the person with cancer. You’ll need to be able to talk to the patient, the medical team, friends, family, and even people you barely know who are concerned about the patient. This can be hard to do. And when you need information from the medical team, it may not be possible to get it without signed permission from the patient.\nA few tips to help you communicate clearly:\nRespect your own feelings, needs, and desires, as well as those of the patient.\nSpeak out about your feelings while being sensitive to those of others.\nTry to use “I” statements rather than “you” statements. For instance, say, “I need a break” instead of “You never help me!” Beware of statements like, “I feel you ignored me,” which says to the other person that he or she did something wrong. Instead, try “I didn’t hear you answer when I mentioned ______,” or “I need help with this problem.”\nFocus on the present rather than bringing up old patterns or hurts.\nHow do I talk to the patient?\nStart with the patient. Let them know you want to be there for them and want and need to be included in their care. Try something like:\n“This is a scary time for both of us, but I want to be here for you to help you get through this. You’re not alone.”\n“I’ll do whatever I can to help you through this. I might do the wrong thing sometimes, or not know what to do, but I’ll do my best.”\n“We can do this together. Let’s try to be open with each other and work with each other no matter what happens.”\nIt’s good to set a goal of openness and sharing right from the start. Remind each other that you’re “on the same team.” Share your fears and worries. Sometimes it may be hard and you’ll disagree and maybe even fight, but openness will help you deal with the conflict. It will also help you keep supporting each other and reduce distress and anxiety. Acceptance and sharing will help keep your relationship strong.\nHow do I talk with the medical team?\nFirst, get the patient’s consent.\nThe caregiver is often the link between the patient and the medical team. In general, the medical team can share information with you anytime you are with the patient. But there are laws that protect private health information. These laws affect what medical information your loved one’s health care team can talk to you about when the patient isn’t present. Still, there are ways you can get information on behalf of the person with cancer. The simplest and most common way is for the patient to sign a release form that lets the doctor discuss their care with you.\nTalk to the doctor about what steps need to be taken so that the health care team can talk to you about the patient’s care. Then be sure there’s a copy of the form in the patient’s records and keep the release form up to date. It’s also a good idea to keep a back-up copy for your files. When you call the doctor’s office, you may need to remind them that they have the form and they can discuss the patient’s care with you.\nIf you don’t have a form like this completed yet, you probably won’t be able to get certain kinds of information. But you can still share information with the doctor. You can tell the office staff that you are giving information rather than asking for it. Even without the patient’s consent, you can try asking for general information about problems the patient has; for example, “Is vomiting one of the side effects of the chemotherapy that Joe got this week?” Or you can ask for advice; for instance, “If Joe has been vomiting for 2 days, should we come in to see you?” Even though you may not get details of Joe’s care, you may be able to get some help in deciding what to do next.\nKeep in mind that there are different forms that are signed for different purposes. Here we are talking about a release form that allows the doctor to share medical information with you. Doctor’s offices may call this a “HIPAA form.” This type of release does not give you permission to make decisions about the patient’s care.\nIf you want to learn more about informed consent, decision-making, or other forms that may affect treatment decisions, see Informed Consent and Advance Directives.\nWhich doctor do I talk to?\nCancer treatment often involves more than one doctor. There may even be a team of doctors, nurses, and other people taking care of your loved one. You might get information from many of these people, but it’s a good idea to pick one doctor to be the one you go to with questions. Most people choose the doctor they see most often. In choosing a doctor as your main contact, some things you may want to ask are:\nWill you be the one to coordinate care?\nWill you keep the other doctors updated on what’s going on?\nThe person with cancer should feel at ease with the doctor, and you should too. But sometimes, it takes a little time and work before this happens. Take the time to ask your questions and make your concerns known. The doctor should also take the time to answer your questions and listen to your concerns. If you, the patient, and the doctor feel the same way about sharing information and making choices, you’ll probably have a good relationship and you can get what you need.\nIf you want to know more about how to talk with the health care team, see Health Professionals Associated With Cancer Care and Talking With Your Doctor.\nMost health experts who work in the field of cancer do so because they care about the needs of people with cancer. When you look back on this experience, some of your strongest memories may be of those health care providers who were with you through a really hard time.\nShould I go to doctor visits with the patient?\nGoing to see the doctor with the patient is a good way to learn more about his or her medical condition. This can be very helpful when caring for the patient later on. It can also help the patient who forgets to mention problems to the doctor and/or comes home without the information you need. And finally, if you need a referral, maybe for a specialist, social worker, or medical supplier, you may be able to get the names of people who can help.\nHow do I use time with the doctor well?\nThe average doctor’s appointment is about 10 to 15 minutes or even less, so it helps to be ready for each visit. You and the patient should figure out the most important things you need to talk about before you go. For instance:\nWhat symptoms do you need to tell the cancer team about?\nWhen did these symptoms start?\nMaking a list ahead of time to take with you will help you to use your time in the office well. And it means you won’t forget anything important.\nDon’t leave the office until the doctor answers all your questions and you both understand what to do next. Nurses can also be great sources of information, and you might get to spend more time with them than the doctor. Take notes on what’s said to you. This will help you keep track of what you should remember. If you’re getting back test results, be sure you understand the results before you leave. If blood work or other tests were done, find out when and how you’ll get the results. Also, ask who will tell you what the results mean.\nA voice recorder can also be a useful tool. Most doctors and nurses are comfortable with their patients using one, but be sure to ask before you do.\nWhat should I know about new medicines?\nIf the patient gets a prescription for a new medicine, be sure you know the name of the drug, what it’s for, and why they are getting it. Some other things you need to know are:\nHow and when should the medicine be taken?\nWhat’s the dose?\nShould it be taken with food, water?\nAre there side effects? (Like sleepiness, nausea, or dry mouth?)\nHow will you know if it’s working? How long before you can expect it to work?\nWill it interfere with any other medicines or supplements the patient is taking?\nAre there foods, vitamins, or medicines that should be avoided while taking this drug?\nWhat should you do if a dose is forgotten? Take another? Skip it?\nHow much does it cost? Will health insurance cover it? Is there a generic substitute?\nBe sure you add the new medicine to the list of all the medicines the patient is taking.\nHow can family meetings help?\nToday’s families are very busy, and it can be hard to keep everyone up to date on what’s happening with the patient. Family members may feel frustrated and left out. They may not understand the medical condition, especially if the patient is having problems. They also might not know that their help and ideas are needed, or how best to help.\nOne way to keep everyone informed is to have family meetings. When planning a family meeting, it’s important to include everyone who is or will be part of the home caregiving team. This could include a family friend, neighbor, or paid caregiver – and don’t forget the patient! If it’s hard to get everyone together, a conference call or speaker phone might help solve the problem. Some of the things that may be covered are:\nThe latest report from the doctor: How things are going; what to expect next.\nSharing feelings and concerns\nWhat the person with cancer wants and needs.\nHow much time each family member has to help out or visit.\nWays each person can help. What other help might be available.\nFinancial concerns about caregiving\nHow much the caregiving plans will cost\nHow much work family members can afford to miss\nOther financial help available\nHelp for the main caregiver (help with meals, shopping, cleaning, laundry, yard work, child care, etc.)\nHow to get breaks from caregiving from time to time\nEmotional support for patient and caregiver by phone or email\nWho can help with medical care, like taking the patient for treatment or to doctor’s appointments\nWho can help with sharing news and updates on the patient’s condition so that the main caregiver doesn’t have to spend time repeating the news each day\nEvery family has a history. This history affects each person’s role within the family, how members relate to each other, how they feel toward the person with cancer, and how they deal with illness. There are unspoken rules about what can be expressed and what emotions are OK. It may be hard to hold family meetings if the patient’s condition requires the group to discuss these taboo topics. If you think this will be a problem, you might want to think of ways to defuse the situation beforehand. Sometimes a wise family member can help you. Or you might want to ask a social worker or other professional how to bring up delicate subjects.\nTry to get everyone to focus on the issues at hand. You might even want to write up a list of issues or questions and have everyone look at it and add their own. This way there’s a specific agenda for the family meeting.\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            Written by\n        \n"

        "text": "Making Health Decisions as a Cancer Caregiver\nThe cancer care team will always discuss major health decisions with the patient if the patient can think clearly and share their thoughts. The patient’s decisions will be followed as long as they don’t create safety issues.\nSometimes, what the patient wants is not what others want or will do for them. When patients need help carrying out their wishes, it can be hard on those who want something different from what the patient wants.\nHow do I know what the patient wants?\nEveryday choices are easier to make if you understand the patient’s preferences, habits, and values. What’s most important in the patient’s life? Everyday choices include deciding what to wear, when to bathe or eat, and what else to do after that. But when you’re dealing with cancer even these simple choices can be overwhelming and hard to make. Sometimes even a small crisis can make the patient unable to express what she or he wants or needs. As much as possible, honor the patient’s wishes, but be realistic about the limits on what you and other caregivers can do.\nWhat if the patient won’t do things for himself or herself?\nThis can be frustrating for a caregiver. You feel sure that the patient can do some things for themselves, but you do all of them because the patient won’t. Sometimes there are medical or emotional causes for the problem, such as severe tiredness (fatigue) or clinical depression. If you’re not sure, get the patient to the doctor and state the problem clearly. The cancer care team can help you figure out what may be going on.\nIt’s not always needed and may seem hard to do, but sometimes you might have to set limits. For example:\nTry to figure out what self-care tasks the patient can safely do, such as bathing, dressing, and going to the bathroom. If you don’t know what the patient can do, get the cancer care team to evaluate the patient. Social workers and occupational health professionals may be able to help with this.\nEncourage the patient to do self-care as much as possible.\nEncourage the patient to talk about things they enjoy so the conversation isn’t always about cancer and illness.\nLet the patient make as many personal choices as they can. If they’re overwhelmed with decisions, give them simpler choices by saying, “Would you prefer chicken or fish for dinner?” or “Would you rather wear your blue pants or the brown ones?”\nGet others involved if the patient is avoiding treatments or doing things that can cause harm. Family members can be a strong source of influence. Rally them for support.\nOnce a decision is made, accept it and move on. And if you disagree with the decision that was made about the patient’s treatment, remember that it’s the patient’s decision to make. Congratulate them for being able to make a decision.\nRemember that professional help is available to you. It’s normal to feel frustrated, upset, and stressed when caring for someone with cancer. Use the resources and services of the cancer care team when you need them. They can help you find the support you need, such as mental health counselors, home care services, or financial assistance, so that both you and the patient have the help you need.\nWhat if there’s abuse in the family?\nA diagnosis of cancer can worsen abusive behaviors in families that are already strained. The crisis of a cancer diagnosis can take a toll on both the caregiver and the patient. Taking care of yourself and getting the support you need can help you be a good, effective caregiver.\nPatients are more commonly seen as victims of abuse, but what if the patient is the abuser? Again, the stresses of cancer may make your relationship more difficult. If abusive behavior starts after cancer treatment, the doctor should check to see if there are medical reasons for it. Don’t accept abuse just because the patient is sick.\nThere may be times of misunderstanding, tension, hurt, and anger – but not all the time. Emotions need to be expressed and accepted. Patients and caregivers should treat each other with respect, and should not fear emotional, verbal, physical, or sexual abuse. Talk to someone on the cancer care team if you need help.\nWhen do I call the doctor?\nSometimes it’s hard to know if something is “bad enough” to call the doctor after hours or in the middle of the night. The best way to know when to call is to ask.  This may be a fever or new pain, or some other problem. You can also ask what can wait until the next day or the next appointment.\nAlso be sure you know whom to call after hours, on weekends, and on holidays. If you don’t have 24-hour access to someone on the cancer care team, find out what you should do if there are problems. Should you call your pharmacist if there are problems with the medicines? Should you go to the ER? It often seems like problems come up when the doctor’s office is closed, so be sure you have an emergency plan in place.\nGet more details on dealing with symptoms and when to call the doctor in Managing Cancer-related Side Effects.\nWhat if the patient needs to be moved or relocated?\nOpen and honest discussion with the patient and other family members is the first step in deciding whether the patient needs to live somewhere else for a time.\nCancer and its treatment can cause confusion and forgetfulness, and may worsen the symptoms of other conditions such as dementia. Patients can endanger themselves by forgetting medicines, not eating, leaving the house, or losing track while cooking. Patients can be a danger to themselves and others if they start to hit, bite, or throw things at caregivers or family members. In such cases, the cancer care team needs to know about these behaviors. The patient may need to be hospitalized, if whatever is causing the problem can be treated.\nFor less severe problems, such as mild forgetfulness, unsteady walking, and occasional minor confusion, there may be other options. Again, tell the cancer care team about these problems to find out if there is a medical reason for them and if treatment is needed.\nSometimes the less severe problems can be managed at home if someone can stay with the patient at all times. But these problems deserve special discussion by the family. Otherwise, other family members might assume that the caregiver will be the one to stay home and provide 24-hour care for the patient.\nFamily meetings with the patient, spouse, children, siblings, and other key people can allow everyone to share their thoughts and can help you decide what to do. Sometimes these talks can be very difficult and emotional, but certain topics will need to be covered.\nThe amount or type of care needed. For instance, does the patient need 24-hour supervision? What can she or he safely do without help?\nWhat other living arrangements are available? Can the patient move in with another family member? An apartment closer to the primary caregiver? A smaller house? An independent retirement community?\nThis discussion can be tricky if the patient gets confused or fearful at times. It helps to have the doctor or occupational therapists’ (OT) assessment of the patient’s needs. For example, if their professional opinion is that the patient cannot be alone at all, and the only caregiver has to work full time to make the house payment, something else must be done. An occupational therapist’s assessment can also tell you if the patient can be kept safely in the home if certain modifications are made. Ask your doctor about a referral to OT. This may be easier if the patient is in a hospital or extended care facility. Ask the doctor or nurse about getting an OT evaluation before the patient leaves.\nIs a nursing home or extended care an option?\nThere may come a time when your loved one needs extended care or nursing home care. Even though you might not be with the person all day, you’ll still find that you’re a caregiver. It just may look different, since you’re no longer providing all of the hands-on care. But you’ll still be talking with the staff at the facility, visiting the patient, and staying in touch with those who are providing care.\nYou’ll also be the first one called if there are problems. Your caregiving experience will help you deal with the situations that may come up. You also will know who to call if more help is needed.\nWhat if the patient refuses to leave home?\nSometimes the person with cancer decides they don’t want to live elsewhere. He or she may resist leaving home. It’s a very emotional thing to leave home, even if it’s only for a short time, and emotions are already high. Patients may feel that they’ll no longer be able to set the rules or control their own lives, or they may be afraid of losing their independence. Maybe they don’t want to feel they are a burden on others. And if they’ve lived in the same place for a long time, they probably have strong ties to the community, family, friends, and health care providers, as well as social lives and daily routines.\nIn some cases, you have to be firm, especially if the present situation is unhealthy or unsafe. If you have to act against the wishes of the person with cancer, be direct and explain what you’re going to do. In other cases, there’s room to negotiate. \nYou’ll also need to talk about each person’s concerns. For instance, things like patient safety, convenience, finances, and the care needed should be discussed. Clear plans must be outlined. It helps to check out the physical setting and set up a timeline of patient needs. For instance, are there just certain times during treatment when someone needs to be with the patient? Where will the patient sleep? How about getting up and down the steps inside or outside the house?\nIf this still isn’t working, a social worker may be helpful in exploring options and setting plans in motion. It may also help to have a family meeting with at least some members of the cancer care team so that you can get their input and support.\n"

        "text": "Understanding the Cancer Experience When You’re a Caregiver\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n \n \n  \nOne of the first steps after being told someone you love has cancer will be learning about their diagnosis. This will help you understand the disease process and get an idea of what lies ahead. Some of the first questions that you and the person with cancer should ask the doctor and/or the cancer care team are:\n \n   \n   What kind of cancer is it?\n \n   Where is it? Has it spread beyond where it started?\n \n   What are the treatment options? Which do you recommend?\n \n   What’s the goal of this treatment?\n \n   How long will treatment last? What will it be like? Where will it be done?\n \n   What side effects should we expect?\n \n   How will treatment affect everyday activities?\n \n   What’s the likely long-term outcome?\n \n  \n \n  When a person has cancer, no one can predict the outcome. While there’s no way for them to know for sure, . This will become clearer over time and as they get to know the person with cancer better.\n \n  How do we deal with medical delays?\n \n  Test result delays\n \n  Sometimes it can take a while to get back lab, imaging (x-ray, scan), procedure or biopsy results. This can be even harder to deal with when you’re waiting to get test results to see if it’s cancer or if cancer has come back. It’s scary to find out about a change in blood counts, or a tumor or mass (lump) and not know if it’s cancer.\n \n  Waiting for these results can be a frightening time, and people can go through some strong emotions, including disbelief, anxiety, fear, anger, and sadness. It’s important to know that it’s normal for you and the patient to have these feelings. Some people find comfort in talking with other people about what’s going on, while others wish to keep it very private. Try to respect the patient’s wishes during this time.\n \n  Treatment delays\n \n  Planning cancer treatment takes time. Most people want to start treatment right away. They worry that the extra time taken to do tests or make decisions will take up precious time that could be spent fighting the cancer.\n \n  Cancer treatment should start very soon after diagnosis, but for most cancers, it won’t hurt to wait a few weeks to begin treatment. This gives the person with cancer time to talk about all their treatment options with the cancer care team, family, and friends, and then decide what’s best for them.\n \n  The patient might also want to get a second opinion on what’s the best treatment. This is often a good idea, especially if the patient can see a doctor experienced in treating their type of cancer. A second opinion can give the person with cancer more information and help them feel more confident about choosing a treatment plan. Learn more in Seeking a Second Opinion\n.\n \n  The patient also might want or need time to prepare to put their normal activities “on hold” while getting treatment. For instance, arrangements for work or child care may be needed, and taking care of these things ahead of time can help the patient better focus on dealing with treatment. Learn more about these topics in Family and Medical Leave Act and Helping Children When a Family Member Has Cancer: Dealing With Diagnosis.\n \n  If you or the patient is worried that treatment isn’t starting right away, discuss your concerns with the cancer care team and be sure that any delays will not cause more problems.\n \n  How do we deal with the uncertainty?\n \n  When a person has cancer, they go through different stages. Your understanding and your care will change over time, too. There will be times when you don’t know what will happen next, and with an illness as serious as cancer, that’s a scary place to be. But there are no guarantees in cancer care. There’s no way to know for sure whether treatment will work. No one can predict the side effects or problems your loved one will have during treatment. And even after successful treatment, there’s still the chance that cancer will come back – there can even be a new, different cancer sometime in the future.\n \n  Some ideas that have helped others deal with uncertainty and fear and feel more hopeful are:\n \n   \n   Learn what you can do to keep the person with cancer as healthy as possible, and learn about the services available to you. This can give you a greater sense of control.\n \n   Know that you don’t have control over some aspects of the cancer. It helps to accept this rather than fight it.\n \n   Try to let go of your fears, but don’t deny them. It’s normal for these thoughts to enter your mind, but you don’t have to keep them there. Some people picture them floating away, or being vaporized. Others turn them over to a higher power to handle.\n \n   Express feelings of fear or uncertainty with a trusted friend or counselor. Being open and dealing with emotions helps many people feel less worried. People have found that when they express strong feelings, like fear, they’re better able to let go of these feelings.\n \n   Use your energy to focus on wellness and what you can do now to stay as healthy as you can. Remember to take care of yourself, as well as the person with cancer.\n \n   Find ways to help yourself relax.\n \n   Make time for regular exercise, and be as active as you can.\n \n   Control what you can. Keeping your life as normal as possible and making changes in your lifestyle are just a few of the things you can control.\n \n  \n \n  You play an important role in the health of the person you are caring for, but you cannot control how they are doing physically or mentally. Be careful not to look at your loved one’s progress and good days as proof of your caregiving skills. If you do this, you’ll be more likely to blame yourself when they have bad days and setbacks. Uncertainties and highs and lows are part of dealing with cancer – no one, not even the best caregiver, can control them.\n \n  How do we deal with waiting for the diagnosis?\n \n  It can take anywhere from a few days to a few weeks to find out if it’s cancer and, if so, what kind of cancer. This is a difficult time for the patient as well as for loved ones who are aware of the possibility of cancer. Some notice that they think of worst-case scenarios and wonder if they’ll lose their loved one. Others may try to go through their days as normally as possible and not think about it. Most people have a mixture of dread and hope as they wait for the test results.\n \n  You may want to be there with your loved one when these results are shared. You can help remember questions, offer support, and begin to prepare yourself and others for what’s next.\n \n  How do we adjust to the diagnosis?\n \n  With time, the patient and loved ones will start to adjust to the cancer diagnosis. This is a time of change and action – everyone is getting used to the unexpected and scary situation that they now find themselves in. Even with all the activity, some people go through their days feeling numb and disengaged. Others may be sad, edgy, or angry. Emotions may change from minute to minute as everyone copes in their own way.\n \n  It’s important to get accurate, reliable information in writing to be ready when you or others must ask questions or coordinate care:\n \n   \n   What is the exact name and location of the cancer?\n \n   What’s the stage of the cancer?\n \n   What treatments are recommended? How are they done, and how long do they take?\n \n   Will the patient need to be in the hospital? When and for how long?\n \n  \n \n  After you know the name and stage of the cancer, you can get more information about it by going to Find a Cancer Type or by calling 1-800-227-2345 and talking with a cancer information specialist.\n \n  What do I need to know about treatment?\n \n  Cancer treatment varies a lot depending on the type and stage of the cancer. The most common treatments for cancer are surgery, chemotherapy, and/or radiation. Treatment may mean time in the hospital or making many trips to a clinic for radiation or chemotherapy. The patient may be able to go to some treatments on their own. For other treatments, someone may need to drive or go along. The person with cancer may need more than one type of treatment, and each type comes with its own challenges.\n \n  You’ll want to , since you will probably be helping plan how to make it happen. If you’d like to read more about treatments and their expected side effects contact your American Cancer Society.\n \n  Treatment can be long or fairly short, but even short treatments tend to disrupt a person’s life for several weeks. As the caregiver, your life and your family’s lives may be disrupted, too. You may find that you need to take time off from work. See If You Are About to Become a Cancer Caregiver for more on this.\n \n  During treatment, you’ll want to learn about general cancer info, treatment effects, and how to manage side effects.\n \n  Some questions that you may want to discuss with the cancer team ahead of time are:\n \n   \n   What symptoms do we need to tell you about right away? Which ones can wait?\n \n   How do we reach you after office hours? On weekends? Holidays?\n \n   What can we do to manage side effects?\n \n   How will we know if treatment is working?\n \n  \n \n  Again, you’ll want to write this information down and keep it handy. This can really help if you or someone else runs into problems later.\n \n  Are there tools to help the patient be independent during and after treatment?\n \n   are tools that can help a person be more independent and make your job a little easier. You may also hear these called . These tools can be something as simple as a cane, or as complex as a high-tech lift used to move the patient. Some other examples are walkers, wheelchairs, shower chairs, bath mats, grab bars, portable commodes, or urinals. Monitored medical response systems, webcams, and intercom systems are other options that can help some patients feel safer and give the caregiver peace of mind. But even little things like a pill organizer or large wall calendar can make things easier for everyone.\n \n  Think about the tasks the person with cancer wants or needs to do and how these devices may make it easier or safer. If you’re not sure, talk to the cancer care team or maybe an occupational therapist about tools that might help at home. These professionals can give you ideas for ways to help the patient. They can also help you find out where to buy or rent the assistive devices you need. And some may be covered by health insurance, too.\n \n  What should I know about new medicines?\n \n   Some other things you need to know are:\n \n   \n   How and when should the medicine be taken?\n \n   What’s the dose?\n \n   Should it be taken with food, water?\n \n   Are there side effects? (Like sleepiness, nausea, or dry mouth?)\n \n   How will you know if it’s working? How long before you can expect it to work?\n \n   Will it interfere with any other medicines or supplements the patient is taking?\n \n   Are there foods, vitamins, or medicines that should be avoided while taking this drug?\n \n   What should you do if a dose is forgotten? Take another? Skip it?\n \n   How much does it cost? Will health insurance cover it? Is there a generic substitute?\n \n  \n \n  What if my loved one refuses cancer treatment?\n \n  There are people who choose not to get any cancer treatment. This can be very hard for family and friends who may not agree with this choice. But for the most part, people who are able to make decisions for themselves have the right to refuse any and all treatment. \n \n  As someone who cares about and supports the person with cancer, you may wonder why they would make this choice. Maybe the person has health problems that make cancer treatment harder or more risky. Maybe they feel that with their age and life history, it’s just “their time.” Sometimes, the person’s religious beliefs come into play. There are many reasons why people choose to not get cancer treatment. It’s OK to ask your loved one about their reasons for refusing cancer treatment. Even though the answer may be hard to hear, the choice to refuse treatment is the patient’s – no one else’s. Often, the reasons make sense and give you a better idea of what’s going on. It’s also OK to tell the patient what you think. You may say something like, “I hadn’t thought about it that way, and I’m glad you shared your point of view with me.” Or, “I wish you would talk to a doctor about treatment options, but I’ll support your choice and help you through this time the best that I can.”\n \n  Even after a person refuses cancer treatment, it’s important to make sure they fully understand their options. You may want to ask the patient to talk with a doctor about the decision and whether any treatments might help. Some patients will agree to talk with a doctor, and others won’t. But don’t be surprised if, after talking with a doctor, the person still refuses treatment. Again, they have the right to make their own choices, just as you have the right to feel the way you do. Try to see it from the point of view of the person with cancer, and continue to offer your support. \n \n  Supportive care can help anyone with cancer – even those who are sure that they don’t want treatment for the cancer itself. Sometimes called palliative care, supportive care helps keep people with cancer from having severe pain, nausea, or other symptoms. It’s care that aims to treat symptoms, not cancer. It helps the person feel as good as possible for as long as possible. \n \n  The person who refuses cancer care may be open to hospice. Hospice workers give palliative or supportive care so that symptoms can be controlled as the cancer runs its course. They also try to help the family and the patient make the most of the time they have left. A patient who is able to make their own decisions may choose to refuse this care, too. This can be hard on the family and loved ones, watching the person suffer while knowing that supportive care could ease the pain and other symptoms. If this happens, loved ones usually do the best they can, but should keep offering hospice and palliative care as an option. This care will be needed even more as the patient’s condition gets worse – the time may come when you cannot manage without help.\n \n  What happens when treatment ends?\n \n  After treatment most patients go into a stage of healing and recovery. Less time is spent in the clinic and you see the cancer care team less often. Patient stress may go down, but caregiver stress may not. Day-to-day care for and monitoring of the patient becomes the caregiver’s job, and not seeing the cancer care team as often may leave you feeling alone and without back-up or support. The caregiver plays a key role during this time and there can be many responsibilities.\n \n  There’s still uncertainty to deal with here. It’s hard to know if or when the cancer may come back even if the doctor says there’s “no evidence of cancer.”\n \n  Ask the doctor these kinds of questions, and write down the answers for later:\n \n   \n   What kind of follow-up visits are needed? How often and for how long?\n \n   Are there any symptoms we should let you know about? Who should we call for other problems?\n \n   When will the patient be able to go back to a regular work schedule (if he or she has been off work or working fewer hours)?\n \n   How will we know if the cancer has come back?\n \n  \n \n  After treatment is over, be sure that the patient has copies of their medical information. Some people collect this information as they go through treatment instead of waiting until the end. Either way, once all of this information is collected, be sure to keep copies for the patient. These records are important in the event that questions come up later, the patient needs to see a different doctor in the future, or if the cancer comes back.\n \n  When can the patient go back to their normal activities?\n \n  In most cases, the patient can slowly increase their activities at home. How quickly they can do this will depend on their physical condition and the type of cancer treatment they had. Still, with patience and time, most people can get back to their “normal” lives after cancer treatment.\n \n  It’s possible that life-saving treatments may have affected the patient in ways that won’t ever go away. For some people, long-term effects mean permanent life changes, so that they can’t go back to the life they had before treatment. It’s normal for the patient and sometimes loved ones to grieve whatever might have been lost due to treatment. Accepting these losses can take time for both the patient and caregiver.\n \n  As the caregiver, you may find yourself continuing to do the things you did when the patient was in treatment. But it’s important that, over time, you let the patient go back to doing the things they can and should do on their own. This may take place over a period of months as the patient gets stronger. Check in every week or so to see what you’re doing that the patient can start doing, either alone with a little help. If there are things that the patient can’t quite do, talk with the doctor about a referral to a physical therapist or occupational therapist. These professionals may be able to maximize the patient’s abilities by helping build muscle strength and/or offering assistive devices.\n \n  What if treatment doesn’t stop?\n \n  Sometimes treatment doesn’t end at the expected time. In some patients, cancer is treated as a chronic illness – a disease that people live with and manage on a day-to-day basis, much like diabetes or heart disease.\n \n  This can be a very demanding situation for a caregiver. You’re helping the patient as he or she gets treatment, so there are ongoing side effects and frequent appointments to deal with. The difference is that in this case, you don’t really know how long it will last. Living with this uncertainty can be an extra challenge.\n \n  Some patients are able to go back to work during long-term treatment, though they may need extra help just after treatments. They may also need help with home responsibilities, family, and bills. In other cases, less frequent chemo treatments and better management of side effects mean that the caregiver can work a more normal schedule during chronic treatment. In some cases, both the patient and caregiver go back to outside jobs. Still, chemo or other treatments usually mean that some schedule changes will be needed.\n \n  Even if everyone goes back to their jobs, someone will still need to keep up with the treatment plan, the medical records, and the bills. This can be demanding for the patient and caregiver. You may both need support with the amount of work that’s needed on top of working and dealing with cancer. And emotional support may be needed to help the patient, caregiver, and other family members cope with knowing that the cancer cannot be cured.\n \n  When treatment stops helping – what then?\n \n  If treatment is no longer helping and the cancer is still growing, your loved one may decide to stop treatment and choose care to help him or her live with symptoms. This is a time when it helps to know what’s most important to your loved one. What makes his or her life worth living? It helps if the patient can put this into words and share it with others that are close to him or her.\n \n  The patient will have to decide things like, “When do I stop trying to beat the cancer and enjoy the rest of my life?” or “Would I rather spend the next 2 months reading to and playing with my grandchildren or dealing with side effects?” Knowing what’s most important to the patient helps the caregiver and family members understand these decisions. Sometimes, caregivers can help patients clarify their highest priorities so that they can focus on them before the chance is lost. Other times, it may take someone on the cancer care team or a mental health professional to help the patient clarify what’s most important to them, and what can be expected from further treatment. This is a difficult time for everyone, and help from the cancer care team may be needed to fully understand the situation and figure out what’s best for the patient.\n \n  What do I do if the patient decides to stop cancer treatment?\n \n  Once the decision to stop curative treatment (treatment aimed at producing a cure) has been made, make sure that other family members and loved ones understand and can support the patient’s decision. It’s now time for another family meeting, where questions can be answered and concerns addressed. Be sure that other day-to-day caregivers are invited, if they’re still involved in the patient’s care. You may need extra help from others at this point, since there’s often more work for the caregiver to do as the end of life nears.\n \n  It’s also time to talk with the doctor about focusing on palliative (comfort) care. Many things can be done to deal with symptoms of cancer, such as pain, trouble breathing, and fatigue. When these symptoms are helped, the patient often has more energy to spend time doing those things that mean the most to them. You’ll want to be in close contact with the doctor to be sure that any new symptoms are quickly addressed. For more information on what to expect at this time, you might want to read Nearing the End of Life.\n \n  If the patient is expected to live only a few months, hospice may be a good option. Hospice care is intended to relieve discomfort and make the patient better able to enjoy the time they have. In most cases, hospice is given at home and requires that the patient have a primary caregiver. For more on hospice and how it works, see Hospice Care.\n \n  If there are children in the family, it’s important for them to understand what’s going on. For ideas on talking with children and teens, see Helping Children With Cancer in the Family: Dealing With Terminal Illness.\n \n  As you work with the patient and help make the most of the rest of his or her life, it’s normal to feel sad and even start to grieve at the thought of losing your loved one. You’ll want to continue with your circle of support and any spiritual outlets you have. A support group or mental health professional may also help as you go through this time. You can find out more in Coping With the Loss of a Loved One.\n"

        "text": "Patient Job, Insurance, and Money Concerns for Caregivers\nCan the patient keep working during treatment?\nThe patient with cancer often wants to keep working through treatment. Work is an important part of many people’s lives, and often a way to maintain some stability and control. In some cases, it’s possible to work during treatment. In others, it’s not. There are many things to take into consideration when deciding whether to work through treatment. Talk to the cancer care team for advice. You can also see Working During Cancer Treatment to learn more about how to do this and the legal protections the patient has available. It also covers what can be done to keep health insurance coverage if the patient is unable to work or can only work part time.\nWhat do we need to know about the patient going back to work after treatment?\nAs cancer treatment comes to an end and the patient begins to recover, at some point the patient may be given the “all clear” to go back to work. You may need to help get the letters from the doctor that will be needed to clear the patient for full work duties when the time comes. And even when your loved one starts working a more normal schedule, there may be days of extreme tiredness in which your help will still be needed. It may take some time to get past this phase, and you may still need your circle of helpers so that you, too, can start getting back to a more normal schedule.\nTips on how to manage this transition and the legal protections available are covered in Returning to Work After Cancer Treatment.\nWhat do I need to do with the patient’s health insurance?\nCancer is a very costly illness. Even if the patient has health insurance, it surprises many people to learn how much they have to pay out-of-pocket for cancer care. And the patient is probably going to need help keeping track of it all, figuring out what’s covered and what isn’t, and paying deductibles and co-pays.\nYou or someone else will probably need to help set up a system for tracking costs, comparing insurance statements, and keeping careful records. Patients will need to stay in touch with their insurance plan in case there are reimbursement problems. The patient may need to give permission to the insurance company to talk about problems and disputes with the person chosen to help with insurance.\nHow do I deal with all the money issues?\nFor the person who has lost their income because they had to quit their job to be a full time caregiver, financial problems can become overwhelming very quickly. Contact us or visit our website for more information on dealing with money issues.\nIf you’re still working, the patient may need extra help – someone to check in on them while you’re at work. Some caregivers may be able to check in by phone as long as their loved one can do some of their own basic care. Or you can start pulling your family together to find people who can be there or call while you’re at work. If there’s a need for skilled nursing care, the patient may be able to get home health visits through their health insurance.\nA few people are able to get paid for time spent caregiving. Some states have Cash and Counseling Programs that can directly pay some caregivers. You can find out whether your state has a program by contacting your local Medicaid office, social services, or health department.\nLegal issues\nIt may be hard to talk about, but legal issues can be a huge source of stress for caregivers, patients, and families. Common worries include who will manage the person’s money and who will make important health care decisions if the patient is unable to do so. It’s important to bring these up with the patient while he or she is still able to make choices. This way, you and the rest of the family can be clear about what the patient wants.\nIf the person with cancer becomes unable to manage their own money\nThere are surrogate decision-making tools that may help you and the patient. One example is the durable power of attorney, which allows the patient to choose the person who can make financial decisions on behalf of the patient. (This is quite different from the , which is discussed below.) The durable power of attorney does not affect health decisions. If you are the health caregiver, you might want to consider asking the patient to let someone else make the financial decisions.\nIf the person with cancer becomes unable to make health care decisions\nA durable power of attorney for health care has nothing to do with money or finances, only health care decisions. It allows the patient to choose someone to make health care decisions if he or she becomes unable to do so. The caregiver is a logical choice in many cases, given their knowledge of the patient and their condition. But it becomes more difficult when the patient and the caregiver have different goals and values. Contact us for more information on living wills and durable powers of attorney for health care, see Advance Directives.\n"

        "text": "When Someone You Know Has Cancer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n \n  \n  \nFinding out that someone you know has cancer can be difficult. If you’re very close to the person, this can be a frightening and stressful time for you, too. If you are not comfortable talking about cancer, you might not be the best person for your friend to talk with at this time. You may need some time to work through your own feelings. You can even explain to your friend that you are having trouble talking about cancer. You might be able to help them find someone who is more comfortable talking about it by helping them look for support groups or connecting with a community or religious leader.\n \n  But if you feel you want to be there to help the person in your life with cancer, here are some suggestions for listening to, talking with, and being around this person. Communication and flexibility are the keys to success.\n \n  Talking with someone who has cancer\n \n  When talking with someone who has cancer, the most important thing is to listen. Try to hear and understand how they feel. Don’t make light of, judge, or try to change the way the person feels or acts. Let them know that you’re open to talking whenever they feel like it. Or, if they don’t feel like talking right at that time, that’s OK, too. You can offer to listen whenever they’re ready.\n \n  There may be times when the uncertainty and fear make the person with cancer seem angry, depressed, or withdrawn. This is normal and is a part of the process of grieving what was lost to the cancer (things like health, energy, time). Over time, most people are able to adjust to the new reality in their lives and go forward. Some may need extra help from a support group or a mental health professional to learn to deal with the changes cancer has brought into their lives.\n \n  Someone with cancer might feel guilty that they’ve done something to cause their cancer. Some people are made to feel guilty by others who might ask them if they did things in the past that might have caused their cancer. This is called  and can sometimes make a person with cancer blame themselves for their illness or feel left out, isolated, depressed, and as if they don’t have much support. It can even affect how they approach their treatment, affect their quality of life, and might make them avoid follow-up care. If someone feels stigmatized for their cancer diagnosis, be reassuring and show you care. Help them know that they can’t change what might have happened in the past,  but they can take charge of their life and care while going through treatment and beyond. \n \n  Some people with cancer might talk about death, worry about their future or their family’s future, or talk about their other fears. You don’t always have to respond but be ready to hear their pain or the unpleasant thoughts they might want to share. If you are asked your opinion about their illness, treatment, or other parts of their cancer journey, be open and honest, but don’t try to answer questions that you don’t know the answers to.\n \n  You’re not alone if you don’t know what to say to someone who has cancer. You might not know the person very well, or you may have a close relationship. It can be harder in the workplace because relationships with co-workers are so varied. You might not know the person very well, or you may have worked together for many years and be close friends.\n \n  The most important thing you can do is mention the situation in some way that shows your interest and concern. You can express encouragement, and/or you can offer support. Sometimes the simplest expressions of concern are the most meaningful. And sometimes just listening is the most helpful thing you can do.\n \n  Try to make your response honest and heartfelt. Here are some ideas:\n \n   \n   \"I'm not sure what to say, but I want you to know I care\".\n \n   \"I'm sorry to hear that you are going through this\".\n \n   \"How are you doing?\"\n \n   \"If you would like to talk about it, I'm here\".\n \n   \"Please let me know how I can help\".\n \n   \"I'll keep you in my thoughts\".\n \n  \n \n  While it’s good to be encouraging, it’s also important not to show false optimism or tell the person with cancer to  stay positive. Doing these things might seem to discount their very real fears, concerns, or sad feelings. It’s also tempting to say that you know how the person feels. But while you  know this is a trying time, no one can know exactly how any person with cancer feels.\n \n  Using humor can be an important way of coping. It can also be another approach to support and encouragement.  This can be a great way to relieve stress and take a break from the more serious nature of the situation. But you never want to joke unless you know the person with cancer can handle it and appreciate the humor. Let the person with cancer take the lead; it’s healthy if they find something funny about a side effect, like hair loss or increased appetite, and you can certainly join them in a good laugh.\n \n  If they look good, let them know! Avoid making comments when their appearance isn’t as good, such as “You’re looking pale,” or “You’ve lost weight.” It’s very likely that they’re acutely aware of it, and they may feel embarrassed if people comment on it.\n \n  It’s usually best not to share stories about family members or friends who have had cancer. Everyone is different, and these stories may not be helpful. Instead, it’s OK to let them know that you are familiar with cancer because you’ve been through it with someone else. Then they can pick up the conversation from there.\n \n  Respect the privacy of someone who has cancer\n \n  If someone tells you that they have cancer, you should never tell anyone else unless they have given you permission. Let them be the one to tell others. If someone else asks you about it, you can say something like, “It’s not up to me to share this, but I’m sure (____)  will appreciate your concern. I’ll let them know you asked about them.”\n \n  It might feel awkward if you hear through the grapevine that someone has cancer. You could ask the person who told you if it’s public information. If it’s not, you probably shouldn’t say anything to the person with cancer. But if it is public information, don’t ignore it. You might say, in a caring way, “I heard what’s happening, and I’m sorry.”\n \n  You may feel angry or hurt if someone who’s close to you didn’t share the news of a cancer diagnosis with you right away. No matter how close you are, it may take time for the person to adjust to the diagnosis and be ready to tell others. Don’t take it personally. Focus on how you can support that person now that you know. For  suggestions on how to do this, see  How To Be a Friend To Someone With Cancer.\n \n  How do I get over feeling uncomfortable around someone who has cancer?\n \n  Feeling sorry for them, or feeling guilty for being healthy yourself, are normal responses. But by turning those feelings into offerings of support, you make the feelings useful. Asking how you can help can take away some of the awkwardness. Cancer is a scary disease. It can create a great deal of uneasiness for people who don’t have experience dealing with it. Don’t be ashamed of your own fears or discomfort. Be honest with the person about how you feel. You might find that talking about it is easier than you think.\n \n  Cancer often reminds us of our own mortality If you are close in age to the person with cancer or if you are very fond of them, you may find that this experience creates anxiety for you. You might notice feelings somewhat like those of the person who has cancer: disbelief, sadness, uncertainty, anger, sleeplessness, and fears about your own health. If this is the case, you may want to get support for yourself from a mental health professional or a local support group. If your company has an Employee Assistance Program (EAP), you can contact a counselor that way. You can also use other sources of counseling, such as your health insurance or religious support services.\n \n  How does someone cope with cancer?\n \n  People develop all kinds of coping styles during their lives. Some people are quite private, while others are more open and talk about their feelings. These coping styles help people manage difficult personal situations, although some styles work better than others.\n \n  Some people use humor and find it a relief from the serious nature of the illness. But some may become withdrawn and isolated from family and friends. A cancer diagnosis creates a lot of change. People often try to maintain as much control as they can to feel more secure. Some people become very angry or sad. They might be grieving the loss of their healthy self-image, or the loss of control over their lives.\n \n  Some people find it helps to simply be hopeful and do what they can to maintain that hope. Hope means different things to different people. And people can hope for many things while facing cancer.\n \n  You might assume that someone who is positive and optimistic must be denying the fact that they have cancer. If the person with cancer seems upbeat and unaffected by having cancer, don’t assume they’re in denial. Making the most of every day may simply be their way of coping. As long as they are getting medical care, they’re probably not in denial, and their way of coping with cancer should be respected. For more information, please see Coping With Cancer in Everyday Life.\n \n  There are many sources of support for people facing cancer. These include visitation programs like the American Cancer Society Reach To Recovery  program for women with breast cancer,. There are local support groups options through the American Cancer Society as well., and even If you're interested in online groups, like the American Cancer Society has a Cancer Survivors Network, and you can also check out others such as the Cancer Support Community, the Cancer Hope Network, and CancerCare, to name just a few.\n \n  Some of our local offices may be able to help with transportation and can put you in touch with other sources of support. To find out about services where your friend lives, contact your American Cancer Society.\n \n  What if the person 's cancer comes back?\n \n  In some cases, a person’s cancer will come back (recur or recurrence) and treatment might begin again or a new treatment might be needed. The person with cancer may or may not react the same way they did the first time. Again, communication is key. Most people are quite upset if they learn their cancer is back. They may feel they don’t have the emotional or physical reserves to get through it again, they might be empowered to be as strong as possible. They may have expected it to come back, or are simply ready to face it again. By equipping yourself with the knowledge of how best to talk to the person with cancer, you can be most helpful to them.\n \n  What if the person refuses or stops cancer treatment?\n \n  At some point during a person's cancer journey, they might refuse or decide to stop cancer treatment. You might feel like they're giving up, and that can be upsetting or frustrating. You might not agree with their decision, but it is important to support them and give them the space to decide what they feel is best for their health, well-being, and quality of life.\n \n  Even after a person refuses cancer treatment or decides to stop their treatment, it's important to make sure they fully understand their options. You might want to suggest the person to talk with their cancer care team about their decision. Some will and others won't. After talking to their cancer care team, don't be surprised if your loved one still decides to stop or refuse treatment. Continue to offer your support.\n \n  Palliative care can help anyone with cancer, even those who are sure that they don't want treatment for the cancer itself. Palliative care is focused on treating or improving symptoms like pain or nausea, and not the cancer itself. It helps the person feel as good as possible for as long as possible.\n \n  The person who refuses or stops cancer care may be open to hospice. Hospice care treats a person's symptoms so their last days may be spent with dignity and quality, surrounded by their loved ones. Hospice care is also family-centered – it includes the patient and the family in making decisions.\n \n  Encourage someone who has stopped or refused cancer treatment to talk to their cancer care team about palliative care and/or hospice.\n \n  Facing the final stages of life\n \n  When someone's cancer is no longer responding to treatment, it can also be a scary time for those close to them. No matter how hard it might be, it's still important to try to be there to give support. Try to follow the cues and stay in the background but be available when they need you.\n \n  Some people worry about what to say when a person with cancer talks or asks about dying. Listen to them and be open and honest. Don’t try to answer questions that you don’t know the answers to. Offer to help them reach out to their health care team. There are no magic words for a person who is dying, but often your presence and support goes a long way.\n \n \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            Written by\n        \n\n    \n        \n            References\n        \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n    \n            \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n            \n\n            The American Cancer Society medical and editorial content team\nOur team is made up of doctors and oncology certified nurses with deep knowledge of cancer care as well as journalists, editors, and translators with extensive experience in medical writing.\n\n        \n\n    \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n            \n        \n\n    \n        \n    \n            \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n        \n            \n            American Cancer Society.

        "text": "How to Be a Friend to Someone with Cancer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n \n  \n  \nFriendship and cancer\n \n  Today, most people with cancer are treated as outpatients, meaning they don’t have to stay in the hospital. During this time they often need help, support, and encouragement.\n \n  Many studies have found that cancer survivors with strong emotional support tend to better adjust to the changes cancer brings, have a more positive outlook, and often report a better quality of life. Research has shown that people with cancer need support from friends. You can make a big difference in the life of someone with cancer.\n \n  \n \n   \n  \n \n  As you spend time with your friend and learn more about how cancer is affecting their everyday life, keep your eyes open for other things you can offer. See how your friend responds to different activities, and know that the situation may change as treatment goes on. Tailoring your help to what they need and enjoy most is the best way to be a friend. Here we will give you some ideas about where to start.\n \n  What you can do: Notes and calls\n \n  Make sure your friend knows that they’re important to you. Show that you still care for your friend despite changes in what they can do or how they look.\n \n   \n   Send brief, frequent notes or texts, or make short, regular calls\n \n   Ask questions\n \n   End a call or note with “I’ll be in touch again soon,” and follow through\n \n   Call at times that work best for your friend or set times for them to call you\n \n   Return their messages right away\n \n   Check in with the person who helps with their daily care (caregiver) to see what else they might need\n \n  \n \n  What you can do: Visits\n \n  Cancer can be very isolating. Try to spend time with your friend – you may be a welcome distraction and help them feel like they did before cancer became a major focus of their life.\n \n   \n   Always call before you visit. Be understanding if your friend can’t see you at that time.\n \n   Schedule a visit that allows you to give physical and emotional support for the caregiver, too. Maybe you can arrange to stay with your friend while the caregiver gets out of the house for a couple of hours.\n \n   Make short, regular visits rather than long, infrequent ones. Understand that your friend might not want to talk, but they may not like being alone either.\n \n   Begin and end the visit with a touch, a hug, or a handshake.\n    \n \n   Be understanding if you are asked .\n \n   Always refer to your next visit so your friend can look forward to it.\n \n   Offer to bring a snack or treat to share so your visit doesn’t impose on the caregiver.\n \n   Try to visit at times other than weekends or holidays, when others may visit. Time can seem the same to a house-bound patient. A Tuesday morning can be just as lonely as a Saturday night.\n \n   Take your own needlework, crossword puzzle, or book, and keep your friend company while they doze or watch TV.\n \n   Share music they enjoy, watch their favorite TV show, or watch a movie with your friend.\n \n   Read sections of a book or newspaper, or find topics of interest online and summarize them for your friend.\n \n   Offer to take a short walk with your friend if they are up to it.\n \n  \n \n  \n \n   \n  \n \n  What you can do: Conversation\n \n  Many people worry that they don’t know what to say to someone with cancer. Try to remember that the most important thing is not what you say – it’s that you’re there and willing to listen. Try to hear and understand how your friend feels. Let them know that you’re open to talking whenever they feel like it. Or, if the person doesn’t feel like talking, let them know that’s OK, too.\n \n   \n   Listen without always feeling that you have to respond. Sometimes a caring listener is what the person needs most.\n \n   Gear the conversation to your friend’s attention span so they don’t feel overwhelmed or guilty about not being able to talk.\n \n   Help your friend focus on whatever brings out good feelings, such as sports, religion, travel, or pets.\n \n   Help your friend keep an active role in the friendship by asking advice, opinions, and questions – even if you don’t get the response you expect.\n \n   Ask your friend if they’re having any discomfort. Suggest new ways to be more comfortable, such as using more pillows or moving the furniture.\n \n   Give honest compliments, such as “You look rested today.”\n \n   Support your friend’s feelings. Allow them to be negative, withdrawn, or silent. Resist the urge to change the subject.\n \n   Don’t urge your friend to fight the disease if they feel it’s too hard to do it.\n \n   Don’t tell them how strong they are; they may feel the need to act strong even when they’re sad or exhausted.\n \n   Be sure to include your friend when talking to others in the room.\n \n   Assume that your friend can hear you even if they seem to be asleep or dazed.\n \n   Don’t offer medical advice or your opinions on things like diet, vitamins, and herbal therapies.\n \n   Respect their decisions about how their cancer care will be treated, even if you disagree.\n \n   Don’t remind them of past behaviors that might be related to the illness, such as drinking or smoking. Some people feel guilty over those things.\n \n  \n \n  \n \n   \n  \n \n  What you can do: Errands and projects\n \n  Many people want to help friends facing a difficult time. Keep in mind that wanting to help and offering to be there for your friend is what matters most.\n \n   \n   Take care of any urgent errands your friend or the caregiver needs right away.\n \n   Run an errand for the caregiver; it’s as helpful as an errand for your friend.\n \n   Your friend may appreciate it more if you take care of frequent, scheduled errands, rather than fewer ones that take a lot of time.\n \n   Look for ways to help on a regular basis.\n \n   Plan projects in advance and start them only after talking with the caregiver.\n \n   Include the person in usual work projects, plans, and social events. Let them be the one to tell you if the commitment is too much to manage.\n \n   Check before doing something for your co-worker with cancer, no matter how helpful you think you are being. Keep them up-to-date with what’s happening at work.\n \n  \n \n  Suggested ideas:\n \n   \n   Get a list of tasks. Organize friends, neighbors, and co-workers to help complete the tasks on a regular, weekly basis. There are special websites that can help with this.\n \n   Make lunch for your friend and their caregiver one day a week. If your friend is getting chemo, ask what they feel like eating.\n \n   Clean your friend’s home for an hour every Saturday.\n \n   Care for your friend’s lawn or garden twice a month.\n \n   Baby-sit, pet-sit, or take care of your friend’s plants.\n \n   Commit to taking their child to soccer practice or music lessons twice a week.\n \n   Return or pick up library books, movies, or books on CD.\n \n   Buy groceries.\n \n   Go to the post office.\n \n   Pick up prescriptions.\n \n   Help make to-do lists.\n \n   Drive family or friends to and from the airport or hotel.\n \n  \n \n  What you can do: How to offer support\n \n  Some people find it hard to accept support – even when they need it. Don’t be surprised or hurt if your friend refuses help. It’s not you. It’s more about pride and their need for independence.\n \n   \n   Provide emotional support through your presence and your touch.\n \n   Help the caregiver. In doing so, you’ll help your friend. Many people are afraid of being a burden to their loved ones.\n \n   Offer practical ideas on what you can do to help, and then follow through.\n \n   Assume your help is needed, even if there are others also helping out.\n \n   If your friend needs medical equipment or money for treatment, you can look into getting something donated or organizing ways to help raise money,\n \n  \n \n  What you can do: Gifts\n \n  Look for small, practical things your friend may need or just enjoy. Think about what their average day is like and what might make it a little better. It’s always good to laugh and smile, too, so look for fun things for your friend.\n \n   \n   Make sure gifts are useful right away. Small gifts given frequently are usually better than large, one-time gifts.\n \n   Give a gift to the caregiver; it’s as welcome as a gift to your friend.\n \n   Insist that a thank-you note is not needed.\n \n  \n \n  Suggested ideas:\n \n   \n   Soft or silly socks\n \n   Fun hats or scarves\n \n   Bright, soft washcloths, towels, or sheets\n \n   Silk or satin pillowcases\n \n   Pajamas or a robe\n \n   Unusual toiletries, such as soap and lotion\n \n   Stamped postcards\n \n   Favorite or unusual foods or snacks\n \n   Self-care items, such as a cancer resource book, a special pillow, or a heating pad\n \n   A massage device\n \n   A small cordless phone\n \n   Pictures of friends\n \n   A CD or download of your friend’s favorite soothing music or nature sounds\n \n   Funny movies\n \n   Audio books\n \n   Journal or notebook\n \n  \n \n  Everyone, no matter how strong, can benefit from having a friend. Your friend with cancer needs you and your support.\n \n  What not to do\n \n   \n   Offer advice they don't ask for or be judgmental.\n \n   Feel you must put up with serious displays of temper or mood swings, You shouldn't accept disruptive or abusive behavior just because someone is ill.\n \n   Assume your co-worker can no longer do the job. They need to feel like a valuable contributing member of the company or department.\n \n   Take things too personally. It’s normal for the person with cancer to be quieter than usual, to need time alone, and to be angry at times.\n \n   Be afraid to talk about the illness.\n \n   Always feel you have to talk about cancer. The person with cancer may enjoy conversations that don't involve the illness.\n \n   Be afraid to hug or touch your friend if that was a part of your friendship before the illness.\n \n   Be patronizing or stigmatizing. For example, try not to ask about past behaviors or talk about what might have caused their cancer. And, try not to use a “How sick are you today?” tone when asking how the person is doing.\n \n   Tell the person with cancer, “I can imagine how you must feel,” because you really can’t.\n \n   Go around someone with cancer if you are sick or have a fever or any other signs of infection.\n"

A formal caregiver, such as a nurse, is paid and has training to care for a patient. Informal and formal caregivers help people with cancer during and after treatment in many ways.\nCaregivers often provide care for cancer patients. \nBeing a caregiver means helping with the daily needs of another person. They may do the following:\nHelp with personal needs, such as bathing, dressing, or shaving.\nDo household chores, such as cleaning, cooking, or laundry.\nManage the person's finances.\nPlan for care and services.\nVisit often.\nCaregiving can also be long-distance, such making appointments and planning care and services by phone or email.\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n        Needs of Informal Caregivers\n\n        Key Points\nCaregiver’s needs change over time.\nCaregivers may have questions about treatment and side effects, how to find helpful resources, and ways to practice self-care.\nCaregivers also have emotional, social, and financial demands.\nCaregivers may have some unmet needs when the patient becomes a cancer survivor.\nThe end of life of a cancer patient increases caregiver distress.\nCaregiver’s needs change over time.\nThe needs of caregivers change as the cancer patient goes from screening to diagnosis, to treatment, and to either long-term survivorship or the end of life. Worry and the need for information are two demands that most caregivers have during the patient’s cancer journey.\nCaregivers may have questions about treatment and side effects, how to find helpful resources, and ways to practice self-care.\nOne of the demands caregivers have is the need for information. They may ask the health care provider about the following:\nThe cancer: What can you tell me about the type of cancer he/she has?\nRisks and benefits:  What are the risks and benefits of treatment?\nSide effects:  How do I take care of his/her side effects while at home?\nMedical and nursing tasks: How do I give an injection? How do I set up the tube feedings?\nRecovery: How long will it take him/her to recover?\nComplementary and alternative therapies: Do I need to check with you before he/she uses a complementary and alternative (CAM) therapy? What CAM therapies are useful?\nCare for themselves: What are the best ways I can care for myself while caregiving?\nEmotions felt by patients and caregivers: What are some ways we can deal with what we are feeling?\nLocal community-based resources: What are some local resources I can turn to?\nCaregivers also have emotional, social, and financial demands.\nCaregivers may need support for themselves, including help with the following:\nManaging their fears about the cancer patient’s condition and worry about the future.\nKeeping up with their job.\nFinding time for their friends.\nPaying their bills.\nCaregivers may have some unmet needs when the patient becomes a cancer survivor.\nWhen the cancer patient becomes a cancer survivor the needs of a caregiver decrease, but there may be concerns that continue. Some caregivers of cancer survivors worry about the following:\nIf the cancer will come back.\nHow to reduce stress in the survivor’s life.\nHow to understand the survivor’s experience.\nThe end of life of a cancer patient increases caregiver distress.\nCaregivers of patients who are nearing the end of life often have lower than expected mental and physical quality of life. Caregiver distress and the number of unmet needs increase as the patient’s end of life gets close.\nHospice care can provide much needed support to caregivers as well as cancer patients. Caregivers are often relieved by the higher quality of end-of-life care in hospice and the honoring of the patients’ goals.\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n        Burdens of Being an Informal Caregiver\n\n        Key Points\nCaregivers may find it hard to cope with the emotional and physical aspects of caring for someone with cancer.\nCaregivers may feel burdened when caring for cancer patients.\nCaregiver burden may be increased by certain factors, such as gender and age.\nCaregivers may find it hard to cope with the emotional and physical aspects of caring for someone with cancer.\nIt is easy to become overwhelmed as a caregiver. Caregivers may worry after hearing the cancer diagnosis or that cancer has come back. It can be hard to give support and stay positive if there is uncertainty about the patient’s future or the patient is suffering. Keeping up with the practical aspects of patient care, such as household chores and medical appointments, while also working, can be hard for the caregiver to balance. The patient also worries about these things, but the top concern of the patient and caregiver may not be the same, which may cause added stress.\nCaregivers may feel burdened when caring for cancer patients.\nCaregiver burden is the stress or strain felt by the person who cares for the family member or friend who needs help during a treatment or an illness. A burden is felt when the demands of caregiving are greater than the resources available to them. These demands can lead to negative effects of caregiving such as:\nAnxiety.\nDepression.\nPost-traumatic stress disorder.\nDecline in quality of life.\nCaregiver burden may be increased by certain factors, such as gender and age.\nThe following factors may increase caregiver burden:\n Women are more likely to have caregiver burden.\n Caregiver burden can occur at any age but increases for the younger and older caregivers. Older caregivers are at risk for caregiver burden when they have the following conditions:Health problems of their own that they neglect.\nFixed incomes.\nSmall social support networks.\nLess time to exercise.\nTrouble remembering to take their own medicines.\nFatigue from lack of sleep.\nIt is common that caregiving by older people may lead to        depression, poor health, and even death.\n Middle-aged caregivers may often have to miss all or part of their workday. Some may even need to take a leave of absence.\n Younger caregivers often juggle work and their own family duties. They may also have to give up part of their social lives.\n People of different races and cultures approach caregiving in their own way. Asian American caregivers often provide more caregiving hours than White, African American, and Hispanic caregivers. They also use less support services, tend to have fewer financial resources, lower levels of education, and higher levels of depression than other groups of caregivers.\nAsian American individuals may not talk about death or dying because they believe it is bad luck. This can make it hard for healthcare providers to discuss prognosis and hospice care with them. Keeping a cancer diagnosis secret from the patient and not talking about it can add to a caregiver’s sense of burden and duty.\n Hispanic and African American caregivers often have strong family ties, which may prevent them from seeking help outside of their family. As a result, they may not use local health resources, including counseling and support groups, home care, long-term care, and hospice services. They usually have higher levels of caregiver strain, a lower household income, and are more likely to reduce their work hours compared with White caregivers.\n Socioeconomic status is the social standing of someone that is measured by a person’s education, income, and job. People with a lower socioeconomic status may have less access to resources and financial help. Lower incomes and limited financial options may cause patients to make treatment-related choices that are not the same as their doctor prescribed.\n Caregivers may need to make changes in the hours they work at their job, make changes in their duties, or take paid or unpaid time off. Work progress may suffer when a caregiver is not focused and can lead to anxiety and depression. Women who have a job are more likely to feel burdened.\n Other roles a caregiver may have include spouse, parent, child, friend, employee, or student. Role strain happens when the rights, duties, and behaviors of one role conflict with a different role. When caregivers perform more than one role, they may become stressed. However, many roles do not always lead to stress. For example, when a caregiver goes to work, they may benefit from the support of their employer and coworkers, and from the time away from caregiving.\n Caregivers may have more burden when the cancer patient leaves the hospital and comes home. The caregiver now must help manage the patient’s symptoms and may be unsure about the prognosis or if the cancer can spread. Visits by home health nurses can help reduce this burden. Sudden changes in site of care, such as going back to the hospital, also increase caregiver burden.\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n        Ways to Reduce Informal Caregiver Burden and Increase Personal Growth\n\n        Key Points\nThere are many ways to help decrease caregiver burden.\nCaregivers may find benefits from caregiving.\nThere are many ways to help decrease caregiver burden.\nThe following therapies or skills may prevent or reduce caregiver burden:\n A type of therapy that helps change the way a caregiver thinks and feels about certain things.\n Many options, such as guided imagery, massage therapy, or healing touch, are available to help caregivers manage stress and anxiety.\n Counseling that helps families work through problems in a way that makes the family stronger.\n One-on-one counseling that focuses on your relationships with other people to reduce caregiver burden.\n Helping the caregiver develop skills that include the following:Ability to assess and manage the patient’s symptoms.\nIdentify solutions to caregiving problems.\nEnhance the caregiver’s ability to cope with cancer caregiving roles and duties.\n Providing caregivers with information about the following to help them better cope with their new role:Diagnosis.\nPrognosis.\nCoping.\nSelf-care/home care.\nImpact on partners and family.\nHospital care.\nFollow-up and recovery.\n Using palliative care to improve the patient’s quality of life. When the patient’s quality of life is improved, the caregiver often feels less burdened.\n A type of therapy that addresses the emotional needs of caregivers.\nWhile the caregiver can try most of these therapies or skills at any time during the cancer patient’s journey, it is most helpful to have them when the cancer patient is given palliative care or at the end of life to help reduce the burden of the caregiver.\nCaregivers may find benefits from caregiving.\nBeing caregiver to a person with cancer can lead to personal growth. Reducing caregiver burden increases the positive effects of caregiving that often lead to personal growth in the following areas:\n Adjusting to things that cannot change.\n Feeling a closer bond with family.\n Being aware of love and support and having a greater joy of life.\n Arranging life priorities in a new order of importance.\n Having a greater sense of closeness to God and renewed spiritual practices.\n Understanding and feeling what others feel.\n Feeling good about self.\n Eating a healthy diet, getting more exercise, and keeping up with medical check-ups.\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n        To Learn More About Caregiving\n\n        For more information from the National Cancer Institute \n        about caregiving, see the following:\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n        About This PDQ Summary\n\n        About PDQ\nPhysician Data Query (PDQ) is the National Cancer Institute's (NCI's) comprehensive cancer information database. The PDQ database contains summaries of the latest published information on cancer prevention, detection, genetics, treatment, supportive care, and complementary and alternative medicine. Most summaries come in two versions. The health professional versions have detailed information written in technical language. The patient versions are written in easy-to-understand, nontechnical language. Both versions have cancer information that is accurate and up to date and most versions are also available in Spanish.\nPDQ is a service of the NCI. The NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). NIH is the federal government’s center of biomedical research.  The PDQ summaries are based on an independent review of the medical literature. They are not policy statements of the NCI or the NIH.\nPurpose of This Summary\nThis PDQ cancer information summary has current information about challenges and helpful interventions for caregivers of cancer patients.  It is meant to inform and help patients, families, and caregivers. It does not give formal guidelines or recommendations for making decisions about health care.\nReviewers and Updates\nEditorial Boards write the PDQ cancer information summaries and keep them up to date. These Boards are made up of experts in cancer treatment and other specialties related to cancer. The summaries are reviewed regularly and changes are made when there is new information. The date on each summary (\"Updated\") is the date of the most recent change.\nThe information in this patient summary was taken from the health professional version, which is reviewed regularly and updated as needed, by the PDQ Supportive and Palliative Care Editorial Board.\nClinical Trial Information\nA clinical trial is a study to answer a scientific question, such as whether one treatment is better than another. Trials are based on past studies and what has been learned in the laboratory. Each trial answers certain scientific questions in order to find new and better ways to help cancer patients. During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works. If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become \"standard.\" Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.\nClinical trials can be found online at NCI's website. For more information, call the Cancer Information Service (CIS), NCI's contact center, at 1-800-4-CANCER (1-800-422-6237).\nPermission to Use This Summary\nPDQ is a registered trademark.

The person who needs help may be a child, an adult, or an older adult. They may need help because of an injury, chronic illness, or disability.\n \nSome caregivers are informal caregivers. They are usually family members or friends. Other caregivers are paid professionals. Caregivers may give care at home or in a hospital or other health care setting. Sometimes they are caregiving from a distance. The types of tasks that caregivers do may include:\nHelping with daily tasks like bathing, eating, or taking medicine\nArranging activities and medical care\nMaking health and financial decisions\n\n\nHow does caregiving affect the caregiver?\nCaregiving can be rewarding. It may help to strengthen connections to a loved one. You may feel fulfillment from helping someone else. But caregiving may also be stressful and sometimes even overwhelming. Caregiving may involve meeting complex demands without any training or help. You may also be working and have children or others to care for. To meet all of the demands, you might be putting your own needs and feelings aside. But that's not good for your long-term health. But you need to make sure that you are also taking care of yourself.\n \n\nWhat is caregiver stress?\nMany caregivers are affected by caregiver stress. This is the stress that comes from the emotional and physical strain of caregiving. The signs include:\nFeeling overwhelmed\nFeeling alone, isolated, or deserted by others\nSleeping too much or too little\nGaining or losing a lot of weight\nFeeling tired most of the time\nLosing interest in activities you used to enjoy\nBecoming easily irritated or angered\nFeeling worried or sad often\nHaving headaches or body aches often\nTurning to unhealthy behaviors like smoking or drinking too much alcohol\n\n\nHow can caregiver stress affect my health?\nLong-term caregiver stress may put you at risk for many different health problems. Some of these problems can be serious. They include:\nDepression and anxiety\nA weak immune system\nExcess weight and obesity\nChronic diseases such as heart disease, cancer, diabetes, or arthritis. Depression and obesity can raise the risk of these diseases even more.\nProblems with short-term memory or paying attention\n\n\nWhat can I do to prevent or relieve caregiver stress?\nTaking steps to prevent or relieve caregiver stress may help prevent health problems. Remember that if you feel better, you can take better care of your loved one. It will also be easier to focus on the rewards of caregiving. Some ways to help yourself include:\n For examples, hospitals offer classes that can teach you how to care for someone with an injury or illness.\n \n Many communities have adult daycare services or respite services. Using one of these can give you a break from your caregiving duties.\n Make a list of ways others can help you. Let helpers choose what they would like to do. For instance, someone might sit with the person you care for while you do an errand. Someone else might pick up groceries for you.\n A support group can allow you to share stories, pick up caregiving tips, and get support from others who face the same challenges as you do.\n to make caregiving more manageable. Make to-do lists and set a daily routine.\n It's important for you to have emotional support.\n Try to find time to be physically active on most days of the week, choose healthy foods, and get enough sleep. Make sure that you keep up with your medical care such as regular checkups and screenings.\n, if you also work and are feeling overwhelmed. Under the federal Family and Medical Leave Act, eligible employees can take up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave per year to care for relatives. Check with your human resources office about your options.\n\n\nDept. of Health and Human Services Office on Women's Health\n",

        "text": "Taking Care of YOU: Self-Care for Family Caregivers\n By Family Caregiver Alliance\n First, Care for Yourself\nOn an airplane, an oxygen mask descends in front of you. What do you do? As we all know, the first rule is to put on your own oxygen mask before you assist anyone else. Only when we first help ourselves can we effectively help others. Caring for yourself is one of the most important—and one of the most often forgotten—things you can do as a caregiver. When your needs are taken care of, the person you care for will benefit, too.\nEffects of Caregiving on Health and Well-Being\nWe hear this often: “My husband is the person with Alzheimer’s, but now I’m the one in the hospital!” Such a situation is all too common. Researchers know a lot about the effects of caregiving on health and well-being. For example, if you are a caregiving spouse between the ages of 66 and 96 and are experiencing mental or emotional strain, you have a risk of dying that is 63 percent higher than that of people your age who are not caregivers. The combination of loss, prolonged stress, the physical demands of caregiving, and the biological vulnerabilities that come with age place you at risk for significant health problems as well as an earlier death.\nOlder caregivers are not the only ones who put their health and well-being at risk. If you are a baby boomer who has assumed a caregiver role for your parents while simultaneously juggling work and raising adolescent children, you face an increased risk for depression, chronic illness, and a possible decline in quality of life.\nBut despite these risks, family caregivers of any age are less likely than non-caregivers to practice preventive healthcare and self-care behavior. Regardless of age, sex, and race and ethnicity, caregivers report problems attending to their own health and well-being while managing caregiving responsibilities. They report:\nSleep deprivation\nPoor eating habits\nFailure to exercise\nFailure to stay in bed when ill\nPostponement of or failure to make medical appointments for themselves\nFamily caregivers are also at increased risk for depression and excessive use of alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs. Caregiving can be an emotional roller coaster. On the one hand, caring for your family member demonstrates love and commitment and can be a very rewarding personal experience. On the other hand, exhaustion, worry, inadequate resources, and continuous care demands are enormously stressful. Caregivers are more likely to have a chronic illness than are non-caregivers, namely high cholesterol, high blood pressure, and a tendency to be overweight. Studies show that an estimated 46 percent to 59 percent of caregivers are clinically depressed.\nTaking Responsibility for Your Own Care\nYou cannot stop the impact of a chronic or progressive illness or a debilitating injury on someone for whom you care. But there is a great deal that you can do to take responsibility for your personal well-being and to get your own needs met.\nIdentifying Personal Barriers\nMany times, attitudes and beliefs form personal barriers that stand in the way of caring for yourself. Not taking care of yourself may be a lifelong pattern, with taking care of others an easier option. However, as a family caregiver you must ask yourself: “What good will I be to the person I care for if I become ill? If I die?” Breaking old patterns and overcoming obstacles is not an easy proposition, but it can be done—regardless of your age or situation. The first task in removing personal barriers to self-care is to identify what is in your way. For example:\nDo you think you are being selfish if you put your needs first?\nIs it frightening to think of your own needs? What is the fear about?\nDo you have trouble asking for what you need? Do you feel inadequate if you ask for help?\nDo you feel you have to prove that you are worthy of the care recipient’s affection? Do you do too much as a result?\nSometimes caregivers have misconceptions that increase their stress and get in the way of good self-care. Here are some of the most commonly expressed:\nI am responsible for my parent’s health.\nIf I donʼt do it, no one will.\nIf I do it right, I will get the love, attention, and respect I deserve.\nOur family always takes care of their own.\nI promised my father I would always take care of my mother.\n“I never do anything right,” or “Thereʼs no way I could find the time to exercise” are examples of negative self-talk\n, another possible barrier that can cause unnecessary anxiety. Instead, try positive statements: “Iʼm good at giving John a bath.” “I can exercise for 15 minutes a day.” Remember, your mind tends to believe what you tell it.\nBecause we base our behavior on our thoughts and beliefs, attitudes and misconceptions like those noted above can cause caregivers to continually attempt to do what cannot be done, to control what cannot be controlled. The result is feelings of continued failure and frustration and, often, an inclination to ignore your own needs. Ask yourself what might be getting in your way and keeping you from taking care of yourself.\nMoving Forward\nOnce youʼve started to identify any personal barriers to good self-care, you can begin to change your behavior, moving forward one small step at a time. Following are some effective tools for self-care that can start you on your way.\nTool #1: Reducing Personal Stress\nHow we perceive and respond to an event is a significant factor in how we adjust and cope with it. The stress you feel is not only the result of your caregiving situation but also the result of your perception of it—whether you see the glass as half-full or half-empty. It is important to remember that you are not alone in your experiences.\nYour level of stress is influenced by many factors, including the following:\nWhether your caregiving is voluntary. If you feel you had no choice in taking on the responsibilities, the chances are greater that you will experience strain, distress, and resentment.\nYour relationship with the care recipient. Sometimes people care for another with the hope of healing a relationship. If healing does not occur, you may feel regret and discouragement.\nYour coping abilities. How you coped with stress in the past predicts how you will cope now. Identify your current coping strengths so that you can build on them.\nYour caregiving situation. Some caregiving situations are more stressful than others. For example, caring for a person with dementia is often more stressful than caring for someone with a physical limitation.\nWhether or not support is available.\n\t \nSteps to Managing Stress\nRecognize warning signs early. These might include irritability, sleep problems, and forgetfulness. Know your own warning signs, and act to make changes. Donʼt wait until you are overwhelmed.\nIdentify sources of stress. Ask yourself, “What is causing stress for me?” Sources of stress might be that you have too much to do, family disagreements, feelings of inadequacy, or the inability to say no.\nIdentify what you can and cannot change. Remember, we can only change ourselves; we cannot change another person. When you try to change things over which you have no control, you will only increase your sense of frustration. Ask yourself, “What do I have some control over? What can I change?” Even a small change can make a big difference. The challenge we face as caregivers is well expressed in the following words modified from the original Serenity Prayer (attributed to American theologian Reinhold Niebuhr):\n“God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change,\n\tCourage to change the things I can,\n\tand (the) wisdom to know the difference.\n”\nTake action. Taking some action to reduce stress gives us back a sense of control. Stress reducers can be simple activities like walking and other forms of exercise, gardening, meditation, or having coffee with a friend. Identify some stress reducers that work for you.\n\t \nTool #2: Setting Goals\nSetting goals or deciding what you would like to accomplish in the next three to six months is an important tool for taking care of yourself. Here are some sample goals you might set:\nTake a break from caregiving.\nGet help with caregiving tasks like bathing and preparing meals.\nEngage in activities that will make you feel more healthy.\nGoals are generally too big to work on all at once. We are more likely to reach a goal if we break it down into smaller action steps. Once you’ve set a goal, ask yourself, “What steps do I take to reach my goal?” Make an action plan by deciding which step you will take first, and when. Then get started!\n (Goal and Action Steps):\n Feel more healthy.\nMake an appointment for a physical checkup.\nTake a half-hour break once during the week.\nWalk three times a week for 10 minutes.\n\t \nTool #3: Seeking Solutions\nSeeking solutions to difficult situations is, of course, one of the most important tools in caregiving. Once youʼve identified a problem, taking action to solve it can change the situation and also change your attitude to a more positive one, giving you more confidence in your abilities.\nSteps for Seeking Solutions\nIdentify the problem. Look at the situation with an open mind. The real problem might not be what first comes to mind. For example, you think that the problem is simply that you are tired all the time, when the more basic difficulty is your belief that “no one can care for John like I can.” The problem? Thinking that you have to do everything yourself.\nList possible solutions. One idea is to try a different perspective: “Even though someone else provides help to John in a different way than I do, it can be just as good.” Ask a friend to help. Call Family Caregiver Alliance or the Eldercare Locator (see Resources list) and ask about agencies in your area that could help provide care.\nSelect one solution from the list. Then try it!\nEvaluate the results. Ask yourself how well your choice worked.\nTry a second solution. If your first idea didnʼt work, select another. But donʼt give up on the first; sometimes an idea just needs fine-tuning.\nUse other resources. Ask friends, family members, and professionals for suggestions.\nIf nothing seems to help, accept that the problem may not be solvable now. You can revisit it at another time.\nNote: All too often, we jump from Step 1 to Step 7 and then feel defeated and stuck. Concentrate on keeping an open mind while listing and experimenting with possible solutions.\nTool #4: Communicating Constructively\nBeing able to communicate constructively is one of a caregiverʼs most important tools. When you communicate in ways that are clear, assertive, and constructive, you will be heard and get the help and support you need. The box below shows basic guidelines for good communication.\nCommunication Guidelines\nUse “I” messages rather than “you” messages. Saying “I feel angry” rather than “You made me angry” enables you to express your feelings without blaming others or causing them to become defensive.\nRespect the rights and feelings of others. Do not say something that will violate another personʼs rights or intentionally hurt the personʼs feelings. Recognize that the other person has the right to express feelings.\nBe clear and specific. Speak directly to the person. Donʼt hint or hope the person will guess what you need. Other people are not mind readers. When you speak directly about what you need or feel, you are taking the risk that the other person might disagree or say no to your request, but that action also shows respect for the other personʼs opinion. When both parties speak directly, the chances of reaching understanding are greater.\nBe a good listener. Listening is the most important aspect of communication.\n\t \nTool #5: Asking for and Accepting Help\nWhen people have asked if they can be of help to you, how often have you replied, “Thank you, but I’m fine.” Many caregivers donʼt know how to marshal the goodwill of others and are reluctant to ask for help. You may not wish to “burden” others or admit that you can’t handle everything yourself.\nBe prepared with a mental list of ways that others could help you. For example, someone could take the person you care for on a 15-minute walk a couple of times a week. Your neighbor could pick up a few things for you at the grocery store. A relative could fill out some insurance papers. When you break down the jobs into very simple tasks, it is easier for people to help. And they do want to help. It is up to you to tell them how.\nHelp can come from community resources, family, friends, and professionals. Ask them. Donʼt wait until you are overwhelmed and exhausted or your health fails. Reaching out for help when you need it is a sign of personal strength.\nTips on How to Ask\nConsider the personʼs special abilities and interests. If you know a friend enjoys cooking but dislikes driving, your chances of getting help improve if you ask for help with meal preparation.\nResist asking the same person repeatedly. Do you keep asking the same person because she has trouble saying no?\nPick the best time to make a request. Timing is important. A person who is tired and stressed might not be available to help out. Wait for a better time.\nPrepare a list of things that need doing. The list might include errands, yard work, or a visit with your loved one. Let the “helper” choose what she would like to do.\nBe prepared for hesitance or refusal. It can be upsetting for the caregiver when a person is unable or unwilling to help. But in the long run, it would do more harm to the relationship if the person helps only because he doesnʼt want to upset you. To the person who seems hesitant, simply say, “Why donʼt you think about it.” Try not to take it personally when a request is turned down. The person is turning down the task, not you. Try not to let a refusal prevent you from asking for help again. The person who refused today may be happy to help at another time.\nAvoid weakening your request. “Itʼs only a thought, but would you consider staying with Grandma while I went to church?” This request sounds like itʼs not very important to you. Use “I” statements to make specific requests: “I would like to go to church on Sunday. Would you stay with Grandma from 9 a.m. until noon?”\n\t \nTool #6: Talking to the Physician\nIn addition to taking on the household chores, shopping, transportation, and personal care, 37 percent of caregivers also administer medications, injections, and medical treatment to the person for whom they care. Some 77 percent of those caregivers report the need to ask for advice about the medications and medical treatments. The person they usually turn to is their physician.\nBut while caregivers will discuss their loved oneʼs care with the physician, caregivers seldom talk about their own health, which is equally important. Building a partnership with a physician that addresses the health needs of the care recipient and the caregiver is crucial. The responsibility of this partnership ideally is shared between you, the caregiver, the physician, and other healthcare staff. However, it will often fall to you to be assertive, using good communication skills, to ensure that everyoneʼs needs are met—including your own.\nTips on Communicating with Your Physician\nPrepare questions ahead of time. Make a list of your most important concerns and problems. Issues you might want to discuss with the physician are changes in symptoms, medications or general health of the care recipient, your own comfort in your caregiving situation, or specific help you need to provide care. The physician only sees a moment in time with the patient. Make sure you let him/her know what your concerns are in terms of daily care/health.\nEnlist the help of the nurse. Many caregiving questions relate more to nursing than to medicine. In particular, the nurse can answer questions about various tests and examinations, preparing for surgical procedures, providing personal care, and managing medications at home.\nMake sure your appointment meets your needs. For example, the first appointment in the morning or after lunch are the best times to reduce your waiting time or accommodate numerous questions. When you schedule your appointment, be sure you convey clearly the reasons for your visit so that enough time is allowed.\nCall ahead. Before the appointment, check to see if the doctor is on schedule. Remind the receptionist of special needs when you arrive at the office.\nTake someone with you. A companion can ask questions you feel uncomfortable asking and can help you remember what the physician and nurse said.\nUse assertive communication and “I” messages. Enlist the medical care team as partners in care. Present what you need, what your concerns are, and how the doctor and/or nurse can help. Use specific, clear “I” statements like the following: “I need to know more about the diagnosis; I will feel better prepared for the future if I know what’s in store for me.” Or “I am feeling rundown. I’d like to make an appointment for myself and my husband next week.” Or “I need a way for my mother to sleep at night as I am now exhausted being up every two hours at night with her.”\n \nTool #7: Starting to Exercise\nYou may be reluctant to start exercising, even though youʼve heard itʼs one of the healthiest things you can do. Perhaps you think that physical exercise might harm you, or that it is only for people who are young and able to do things like jogging. Fortunately, research suggests that you can maintain or at least partly restore endurance, balance, strength, and flexibility through everyday physical activities like walking and gardening. Even household chores can improve your health. The key is to increase your physical activity by exercising and using your own muscle power.\nExercise promotes better sleep, reduces tension and depression, and increases energy and alertness. If finding time for exercise is a problem, incorporate it into your daily activity. Perhaps the care recipient can walk or do stretching exercise with you. If necessary, do frequent short exercises instead of those that require large blocks of time. Find activities you enjoy.\nWalking, one of the best and easiest exercises, is a great way to get started. Besides its physical benefits, walking helps to reduce psychological tension. Walking 20 minutes a day, three times a week, is very beneficial. If you canʼt get away for that long, try to walk for as long as you can on however many days you can. Work walking into your life. Walk around the mall, to the store, or a nearby park. Walk around the block with a friend.\n \nTool #8: Learning from Our Emotions\nIt is a strength to recognize when your emotions are controlling you (instead of you controlling your emotions). Our emotions are messages to which we need to listen. They exist for a reason. However negative or painful, our feelings are useful tools for understanding what is happening to us. Even feelings such as guilt, anger, and resentment contain important messages. Learn from them, then take appropriate action.\nFor example, when you cannot enjoy activities you previously enjoyed, and your emotional pain overshadows all pleasure, it is time to seek treatment for depression—especially if you are having thoughts of suicide. Speaking with your physician is the first step. (See the FCA fact sheet Depression and Caregiving\n.)\nCaregiving often involves a range of emotions. Some feelings are more comfortable than others. When you find that your emotions are intense, they might mean the following:\nThat you need to make a change in your caregiving situation.\nThat you are grieving a loss.\nThat you are experiencing increased stress.\nThat you need to be assertive and ask for what you need.\n\t \nSumming Up\nRemember, it is not selfish to focus on your own needs and desires when you are a caregiver—itʼs an important part of the job. You are responsible for your own self-care. Focus on the following self-care practices:\nLearn and use stress-reduction techniques, e.g. meditation, prayer, yoga, Tai Chi.\nAttend to your own healthcare needs.\nGet proper rest and nutrition.\nExercise regularly, even if only for 10 minutes at a time.\nTake time off without feeling guilty.\nParticipate in pleasant, nurturing activities, such as reading a good book, taking a warm bath.\nSeek and accept the support of others.\nSeek supportive counseling when you need it, or talk to a trusted counselor, friend, or pastor.\nIdentify and acknowledge your feelings, you have a right to ALL of them.\nChange the negative ways you view situations.\nSet goals.\n\t \nResources\n (415) 434-3388 | (800) 445-8106 Website: www.caregiver.org Email: info@caregiver.orgFCA CareNav: https://fca.cacrc.org/loginServices by State: https://www.caregiver.org/connecting-caregivers/services-by-state/\nFamily Caregiver Alliance (FCA) seeks to improve the quality of life for caregivers through education, services, research and advocacy.

You may think that if she keeps getting treatment, something may finally work, or that a new discovery will be made. There's nothing wrong with being hopeful.\n\n\nTry to listen to your loved one and the doctor to really hear what they're saying. Denying the facts about the cancer may make the patient feel that you don't really understand what's happening. Again, it's okay to deal with things at your own pace. But be aware of the effect this may have on others.\n\n\nGrief\n\n\nGrief is the process of letting go and accepting and learning to live with loss. Part of the grieving process is feeling extreme sadness. You may feel sad about the losses you've experienced and the life you used to have.\n\n\nYou may begin to feel the loss of your loved one even before he or she dies. This is called anticipatory grief. It's normal to feel sad about the changes you are going through and the losses you are going to have. Common causes of grief include:\n\n\nYou may have expected your life with your friend or family member to be different than what you’re faced with right now.\n\n\tYou may be feeling sad over the unknowns in the future.\n\n\tYou may be grieving the future loss of your loved one and all the changes involved.\nOnce your loved one dies, grief will become more intense. Everyone is different in how they grieve and in what they grieve for. Let yourself grieve in your own way and time. For example some people:\n\n\nDon't show as much emotion as others when they grieve. They may cry less than you would expect.\n\n\tWithdraw and keep to themselves. Even if they're in public, they may be less talkative than usual.\n\n\tTry to stay busy. They show their feelings by doing things, rather than talking about them.\n\n\tShow their anger more often. They may seem more short-tempered than you're used to them being.\nUnderstand that these feelings of grief are normal. And grief can come up at times when you're not expecting it. Although it can come and go in intensity, grief can last for many months and will vary in intensity. If you feel the need, seek help from hospice staff, a mental health expert, or a support group as you go through the grieving process. \n\n\nFor other feelings caregivers may have during cancer care, see Coping with Your Feelings.\n\n\nIt’s emotionally exhausting and I never know what to expect. One minute, things are looking up, and a couple of hours later, something happens and I don’t have any answers.\n\n\nFred\nAsk for Help from Others\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n    \n  \nYou may be faced with new challenges and concerns now that your loved one has advanced cancer. If the illness has been going on for a long time, these challenges may wear you down even more.\n\n\nMany caregivers say that, looking back, they took on too much. They wish they had asked for help sooner in sharing tasks or seeking support. Many people probably want to help but don't know what you need or whether you want help. And as the cancer progresses, you may see changes in the support you get from others. For example:\n\n\nPeople who have helped before may not help now.\n\n\tOthers who have helped before may want to help in new ways.\n\n\tPeople who haven't helped before may start helping.\n\n\tAgencies that couldn't help before may offer services now.\nAccepting help from others isn't always easy. When tough things happen, some people think they can handle it on their own. But things can get harder as your loved one’s cancer progresses. As a result, many caregivers have said they feel stretched to the point that they can't do it anymore. As simple as it sounds, it's good to remind others that you still need help.\n\n\nRemember that getting help for yourself can also help your loved one as well as other friends and family.\nKeeping a Balance with Visitors\n\n\nYou may have many more people calling you or coming by to visit than ever before. Many caregivers say they feel very blessed when people show they care. But even though you might be very thankful for their love and support, there may be times when you need some space.\n\n\nSome days I go into my bedroom closet and take a nap. It may sound crazy, but it’s the only way I feel like I’m really escaping.\n\n\nGail\n\n\nSome things you can do if you need time to yourself or just with your family are:\n\n\nLet your voicemail pick up the messages.\n\n\tAnswer your phone in shifts. Let family members or friends be in charge of calls for a few hours.\n\n\tPut a sign on the door of your home or hospital room thanking people for coming by and letting them know your loved one is resting. Leave room for a note if they want to write one.\n\n\tHave a friend in your home handle visitors while you can be in another part of your home taking care of your own needs.\n\n\tSet up a website to keep people up to date and let them leave messages. Examples can be found at Caring BridgeExit Disclaimer or Lotsa Helping HandsExit Disclaimer.\n\n\tGo to a place where you can’t be reached for a while.\n\n\n\n        \n        \n\n    ",

These may be due to the side effects of treatment or the cancer itself. Or they may be caused by other drugs. Some caregivers have said that they wished they had known sooner about what changes to expect.\n\n\nChanges may occur in:\n\n\nlooks\n\n\tpersonality or mood\n\n\tmemory\n\n\tsleep\n\n\tappetite or nutrition needs\nThe person you're caring for may or may not go through any of these changes. But you should ask the doctor whether you need to be aware of them and what you can do about them if they happen.\n\n\nNo one told us what these pills would do. My partner started to have mood swings and get really angry at me for no reason. Her nurse told me later that this was common when taking these drugs, but how was I supposed to know that?\n\n\nAshley\nMaking Decisions about Living Arrangements\n\n\nAfter deciding on choices for care, sometimes questions arise about whether the person with advanced cancer should live at home or be moved to a nursing or assisted living facility. When making these decisions, here are a few good questions to ask:\n\n\nWhat kind of help does your loved one need?\n\n\tIf you’re the spouse or other person living with them, are you capable of taking care of them?\n\n\tIf they live alone, is it risky for them to keep doing so?\n\n\tWhat are the options for home care?\n\n\tHow often will they need help?\nYou’ll also need to consider how your loved one feels. They may fear:\n\n\nlosing their independence\n\n\tbeing seen as weak or a burden to others\n\n\tmoving to a health care or other type of assisted living facility\nSometimes it's easier to consider a change in living arrangements when the advice comes from a health professional. Social workers, including visiting nurses, those who work with older adults, and others may be able to help you talk to your loved one about these decisions.\nWhat to Say to Someone with Terminal Cancer\n\n\nWhat do you say to someone with terminal cancer? Whether it’s a spouse, family member, or friend, talking about serious issues is never easy. It’s normal to not know what to say to someone with end-stage cancer, or to worry that you’ll say the wrong thing. But the most important thing is not what you say, but that you're showing you care.\n\n\nThis section offers advice on how to talk about terminal cancer. Your loved one with cancer may want to go to our patient section, Talking about Your Advanced Cancer, for tips as well.\n\n\nIt’s likely that you and your loved one with cancer are both having the same thoughts and fears about the end of life. There will come a time when you will need to talk about these issues together. These might include:\n\n\nthe stage of the cancer\n\n\tpreparing for the future\n\n\tfears about death\n\n\twishes at the end of life\nSome families talk openly about these sorts of things, while others don’t. There's no right or wrong way to connect. But studies show that families who talk things out feel better about the care they get and the decisions they make. A few things to remember are:\n\n\n It's a good idea to talk about the fact that the future is uncertain. Avoiding important issues only makes them harder to deal with later. Talking over your concerns can bring comfort to all involved.\n\n\t It's important to get any thoughts or concerns you both have out in the open. You may find that you both are thinking the same things. Or you may find you’re thinking very different things. \n\n\t This is one of the main ways of showing that you’re there for them. It’s important to be supportive of whatever your loved one wants to say. It’s their life and their cancer. They need to process thoughts and fears in their own time and their own way.\nTalking about Hard Subjects Related to Cancer\n\n\nBringing up issues related to terminal cancer can be tough. You may think, for example, that your loved one needs to try a different treatment or see a different doctor. Or they may be worried about losing independence, being seen as weak, or being a burden to you. \nWhat's important to remember is that your loved one has the right to choose how to live the rest of their life. Although you may have strong opinions about what they should do, the decision is theirs to make. Here are some tips on how to bring up hard topics: \n\n\nPractice what you’ll say in advance. \n\n\tFind a quiet time. Ask if it’s an okay time to talk.\n\n\tKnow what your goals are having this talk. What do you want as the result? \n\n\tSpeak from your heart. \n\n\tAllow time for your loved one to talk. Listen and try not to interrupt. \n\n\tYou don’t always have to say, “It’ll be okay.” \nSome people won’t start a conversation themselves, but may respond if you start first. But if you have trouble talking about painful issues, ask for professional advice. A counselor or other mental health expert may be able to help you and your loved one explore topics that you don’t feel able to on your own. And if they don't want to go to the counselor with you, you can always go alone. You may hear some ideas for how to bring up these topics. You can also talk about other concerns and feelings that you're dealing with right now.\n\n\nWords to Try with Someone with Terminal Cancer\n\n\n Dad, you are going to be just fine. Dad, are there some things that worry you?\n\n\n Don’t talk like that! You can beat this! It must be hard to come to terms with all of this.\n\n\n I can’t see how anyone can help anymore. We will be there for you always.\n\n\n What do the doctors know? You might live forever. Do you think the doctors are right? How does it seem to you?\n\n\n Please don’t give up. I need you here. I will miss you terribly. But we will get through somehow.\n\n\n There has to be something more to try. Let’s be sure to get the best of medical treatments, but we will be together when we have done all we can.\n\n\n Don’t be glum. You’ll get well. It must be hard. Can I just sit with you for a while?\n\n\nFrom J. Lynn, J. Harrold, and J.L. Schuster. Handbook for Mortals: Guidance for People Facing Serious Illness. \nOxford University Press: New York, NY. 2011. Reprinted with permission.\nUnderstanding Your Loved One's Wishes for Care\n\n\nA terminal cancer diagnosis brings up a number of decisions to make. These may be about what type of care or treatment to receive. Or they may be about the kind of information patients and loved ones want to hear. Or deciding where to continue getting care.\n\n\n Yet in some families and also in some cultures, it's common for family caregivers to make most of the decisions. And they may make them with or without the patient knowing. Or, sometimes the patient wants the caregiver to make all the decisions. Making these decisions may be hard on you for a number of reasons including:\n\n\nYour own desires for your loved one’s care may make it hard to decide what is best for them.\n\n\tYour ideas about how to move forward may differ from those of other family members and friends.\n\n\tThe person with cancer may have different beliefs about care than you or other loved ones.\n\n\tThe opinions of your health care team may differ from the patient’s or yours.\n. However, in the end, it's their choice. If you can't agree, you may want to ask someone else to guide the conversation between you both. You might talk to a member of your faith community, a social worker, other people dealing with cancer, or a hospice worker.\n\n\n. It's important to get a sense of how they feel about certain issues while they can still tell you. For example, who would they like to be in charge of their medical decisions? Have they signed advance directives to express what kind of care they want to receive?\n\n\n. For example, you may want to keep them alive, whatever it takes. But they may wish to stop receiving life-sustaining measures at a certain point. Try to keep things in perspective by looking at how the disease has advanced. Listen to the doctors and others who are giving care. Get the facts about the care you wish your loved one would get versus what is being given. \n\n\n. Think about what they would want, or imagine what they would say if they could talk. Try to remember if something was said in the past that would help you decide.  \n\n\n. If this is the case for you, ask a member of your health care team to hold a family meeting and lead a discussion. They can explain the goals of the medical care being offered. For example, are they to:\n\n\nSlow the cancer?\n\n\tLessen pain and other symptoms?\n\n\tProlong life?\nTalking about these issues can help answer remaining questions. Having this talk with everyone present may lessen the conflicts and help the family reach a decision for your loved one.\nTalking to Children about Death\n\n\nChildren of all ages may wonder about dying, life after death, and what happens to the body. It's important to answer all their questions. If not, they may imagine things or make up their own stories. Let them know that everything is being done to keep their loved one comfortable. Tell them that you will keep them updated. (For much more detailed advice on talking to children and others about advanced cancer, see our Talking to Others about Advanced Cancer section.) \n\n\n. Children deserve to be told the truth about a poor prognosis. Hiding the truth from them leaves them unprepared for their loved one's death and can prolong the grief they will feel. And if you don't talk about your loved one's condition or don't tell the truth about it, your children may have a hard time trusting others in the future.\n\n\nBy including children in the family crisis, you can guide them toward healthy ways of coping with what is happening. You can help them prepare for their impending loss in healing ways, such as providing opportunities for them to say goodbye.\n\n\n. To answer tough questions from your kids about the potential death of your loved one, you need to know your own views on the subjects, including:\n\n\nWhat are you hoping for?\n\n\tWhat do you think will happen?\nYou can show children how to hope for the best while accepting the likely outcome of death. If you're honest and up front, you're teaching them that death is a natural part of life. Your honesty shows them it’s okay to talk about death. You can also tell them that they won't be alone in their time of need. You will always be there for them.\n\n\nCounselors and oncology social workers can also suggest ways to talk to kids about death in ways they understand. They may know of local or national programs that offer help to children in these situations. Or they may suggest books, videos, and websites that explore these topics.\nPreparing Children for A Visit with Someone with Advanced Cancer\n\n\nIf your children don't live with the person who has terminal cancer, it's helpful to prepare them before they visit. The decision of whether or not to let them visit is up to you, the person with cancer, and perhaps other family members. However, children should also have a choice about whether or not they want to visit.\n\n\nIf your loved one is in a hospital or other facility, explain what the area and the room will look like. Tell them who might be there and what they might see. Also explain gently if their loved one’s physical condition or personality has changed.\n\n\nFor a younger child, you might say something like this:\n\n\n\"Grandma is very sick. When you see her, she will be in bed. She may not have a lot of energy to play with you or talk to you as much. She may look a little different too.\"\n\n\t\"Mom may be sleeping while you're there. Or she may be awake but won't talk because she's resting. But she'll know and be happy that you're there. She loves you!\"\n\n\t\"Don't worry if you're visiting Uncle Bill and he says things that don't make sense. Sometimes the medicine he takes makes him do that. If it happens, we can tell his doctor about it to make sure he's okay.\"\nSometimes children don't want to visit, or can't for other reasons. In that case, there are other ways of showing they care. They can write a letter or do artwork. They can call the patient or leave messages or songs in their voicemail. Encourage them to show love and support in any way they choose.\n\n\n\n        \n        \n\n    ",

The papers let you state ahead of time what types of treatments you would like and who you choose to make sure your wishes are carried out. Planning your future health care is an important step toward making sure you get the medical care you would want.\n\n\nAll adults should have advance directives. It’s best to fill these out when you’re healthy in case you become ill or unable to make these decisions in the future. Think about taking action now to give someone you trust the right to make medical decisions for you. This is one of the most important things you can do.\n\n\n\n\n      \n\n              \n                    \n    What Are the Types of Advance Directives?\n\n\nA living will is a document used for people to state whether or not they would like to receive certain types of medical care if they become unable to speak for themselves. The most common types of care addressed by a living will are:\n\n\nThe use of machines to keep you alive. Examples include dialysis machines and ventilators (also called respirators).\n\n\t“Do not resuscitate” (DNR) orders. These instruct the health care team not to use cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) if your breathing or heartbeat stops.\n\n\tTube feeding\n\n\tWithholding food and fluids\n\n\tOrgan and tissue donation\n\n\nA durable power of attorney for health care is a document that allows people to name another person to make decisions about their medical care if they are unable to make these decisions for themselves. (It is also called a health care proxy or medical power of attorney for health care.) People often appoint someone they know well and trust to carry out their wishes. This person may be called a health care agent, surrogate, or proxy.\n\n\n\n      \n\n              \n                    \n    Why Are Advance Directives Important?\nFilling out advance directives gives people control over their health care. Choices about end-of-life care can be hard to make even when people are healthy. But if they are already seriously ill, such decisions can seem overwhelming. Some cancer patients want to try every drug or treatment in the hope that something will be effective. Others will choose to stop treatment. Although patients may turn to family and friends for advice, ultimately it is the patient’s decision.\n\n\nIt’s important to keep in mind that if a day comes where you choose not to receive or to stop treatment to control your disease, medical care to promote your well-being (palliative care) continues. This type of care includes treatment to manage pain and other physical symptoms, as well as support for psychosocial and spiritual needs. You have the right to make your own decisions about treatment. Filling out advance directives gives you a way to be in control.\n\n\n\n      \n\n              \n                    \n    When Should I Fill Out Advance Directives?\nIdeally, these documents should be completed when you’re healthy. Yet many people connect filling out advance directives to making decisions near the end of life. But you don’t need to wait until being diagnosed with a serious illness to think about your wishes for care. In fact, making these choices when you’re healthy can reduce the burden on you and your loved ones later on. Talking about these issues ensures that when the time comes, you will face the end of your life with dignity and with treatment that reflects your values.\n\n\nTalk to your doctor, nurse, or social worker for advice or help with filling out advance directives. Most health care facilities have someone who can help. As you prepare your advance directives, you should talk about your decisions with family members and loved ones and explain the reasons behind your choices.\n\n\nIt's hard to talk about these issues. But the benefits of talking to the people close to you about the kind of care you want are:\n\n\nYour wishes are known and can be followed.\n\n\tIt often comforts family members to know what you want.\n\n\tIt saves family members from having to bring up the subject themselves.\n\n\tYou may also gain peace of mind. You are making the choices for yourself instead of leaving them to your loved ones.\n\n\tIt can help you and your loved ones worry less about the future and live each day to the fullest.\nIf talking with your family and other loved ones is too hard, consider having a family meeting and invite a social worker or member of the faith community to guide the discussion. For more details on making these decisions, see the National Institute on Aging's page, Advance Care Planning. \n\n\n\n      \n\n              \n                    \n    What Should I Do with My Advance Directives?\nOnce your advance directives have been completed, the next steps are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n    \n  \nReview them with your doctor or other member of your health care team for accuracy before signing. Most states require a witness to be present at the signing of the documents.\n\n\tGive copies to your doctor, hospital, and family members after you sign them.\n\n\tStore copies in a safe place that's easy to access.\n\n\tConsider keeping a card in your wallet with a written statement that says you have a living will and durable power of attorney for health care and describe where the documents can be found.\nSome organizations will store advance directives and make them available on the patient’s behalf. Contact the National Hospice and Palliative Care OrganizationExit Disclaimer for more information about companies that provide this service.\n\n\n\n      \n\n              \n                    \n    Can I Change My Advance Directives?\nEven after advance directives have been signed, you can change your mind at any time. As a matter of fact, the process of discussing advance directives should be ongoing, rather than taking place just once. This way you can review the documents from time to time and modify them if your situation or wishes change.\n\n\nTo update your document, you should talk to your doctor and loved ones about the new decisions you would like to make. When new advance directives have been signed, the old ones should be destroyed.\n\n\n\n      \n\n              \n                    \n    Are There State Laws for Advance Directives?\nEach state has its own laws regarding advance directives. Therefore, special care should be taken to follow the laws of the state where you live or are being treated. A living will or durable power of attorney that is accepted in one state may not be accepted in another state. State-specific advance directives can be downloaded from the National Hospice and Palliative Care OrganizationExit Disclaimer.\n\n\n\n      \n\n              \n                    \n    More Information about Advance Directives\nThere are a number of organizations that can answer questions and give you more information about advance directives. Two well-known ones are:\n\n\nAging With DignityExit Disclaimer\nAging with Dignity is a national nonprofit organization that worked with the American Bar Association to develop an easy-to-read living will called Five WishesExit Disclaimer.  This document is legal in 42 states and the District of Columbia, and is available in 29 languages, including Spanish and Braille.

Cancer treatment can be very expensive, even when you have insurance. And keeping track of tests and treatments, paperwork, bills, and other records can seem overwhelming.\n\n              \n    \n            \n                    \n    Understand Your Medical Costs\nWhether you're someone who feels financially healthy or a person who is worried you can’t afford treatment, it’s important to understand the costs of your cancer care. Because of the many specialists involved, the type of cancer you have, and the different tests and treatments you may need, knowing what costs to expect is key. Some tips to be sure you understand your costs are:\n\n\n\nCosts vary greatly depending on where you live, what insurance you have, and what each hospital charges. You will also want to think about the costs of drugs, travel, childcare, or anything else that may be a result of your having cancer. As much as possible, know what to expect about costs from the start.\n\n\n\nIf you're taking part in a clinical trial, there will be two types of costs: patient care costs and research costs. For more details about both, see Paying for Clinical Trials.\n\n\n\nTalk with the billing office or a financial counselor at the hospital. If you’re worried about paying medical bills, ask them about options to make payment more manageable, such as:\n\n\npayment plans\n\n\treduced rates\n\n\tpatient assistance\n\n\thelp from charities\n\nTell your health care team if you think the costs of care could be a burden for you. Talking with them about these issues may make you feel uncomfortable, but they are there to help you.  Some patients say it makes them feel better to share their concerns with their doctor. Then decisions about what treatments to use and what medicines to prescribe can be made with those concerns in mind.\n\n\nThe more your doctors know about your circumstances, the more they can be partners in your care. They can also point you to resources that may help you.\n\n\nSocial workers might be able to suggest organizations or other programs that could help you pay for cancer treatment.\n\n\n\nYour employer may have a specific person who can answer questions about your insurance plan or provide a contact name for more detailed information.\n\n\n\nIt’s normal to be confused about your bills, so don’t feel shy about asking questions. You can ask:\n\n\nsomeone in the billing office\n\n\ta social worker at the hospital\n\n\ta trusted friend or family member. See if they can help make insurance-related calls or help organize and track bills and reports.\n\n\tprofessionals who offer services to help with bills and insurance. These can include patient advocates and medical billing advocates. Although they charge a fee, in the long run they may save you money by helping you manage the costs of your care.\n\nIf you're having a hard time paying your monthly bills (such as mortgage, rent, or utilities) during your cancer treatment, talk to the bank or the companies that you owe. They may be able to set up a payment schedule to keep you from falling behind. It’s important to reach out to creditors as soon as you think you could have financial problems.\n\n\n\nNCI's database, Organizations That Offer Support Services, contains lists of organizations that offer emotional, practical, and financial support. Some examples include help with medicines, travel, lodging, and general living expenses.\n\n\nCall NCI’s Cancer Information Service at 1-800-4-CANCER (1-800-422-6237) to ask for help finding referrals and resources.

But it’s important to understand your policy and to create an organized way to pay and follow up on health care bills. Dealing with insurance often takes time and effort and can be a large burden when going through cancer care. Ways to manage this include:\n\n\n\nHave your policy in hand. Review which tests, treatments, and drugs are covered and which are not. Ask if your plan will cover any specialists your doctor might refer you to.\n\n\n\nIt’s important to know these costs when your care begins so you’re not surprised:\n\n\na copay is the amount you pay for each healthcare service, such as a doctor's appointment or a prescription\n\n\ta deductible is the amount you pay for your medical care before your health insurance plan begins to pay\n\n\tcoinsurance is the percentage of costs you pay for a service that your health insurance covers after you have paid your deductible; for example, you pay 20% and your insurance pays 80%\nYou may also want to ask if co-pays are due up front and how much they cost. Being aware of these charges ahead of time will help you make plans for payment.\n\n\n\nFind out how you should pay your balance. For example, do you file a claim? Does the insurance company pay first? Or do you pay the bill and then get reimbursed?\n\n\n\nYour EOBs are the forms you get from your insurance company that list the cost of services and treatments you had and how much of the fee was paid for under your policy. EOBs are not bills.\n\n\n\nIf your doctor feels that you need a test or procedure that is not covered by your insurance policy, you may want to ask if the doctor will write a letter stating why it is needed. You will then submit this letter to the insurance company. If the company does not agree to cover the treatment or procedure, you can go through its appeals process.\n\n\n\nThis way you can talk with the same person each time you have a question or concern.\n\n\n\nFor questions about Medicare coverage, go to Medicare.gov or call 1-800-MEDICARE. Medicare is government health insurance for people age 65 and older. Among other things, you can learn how to save on drug costs, what to do if you have other insurance, and the claims and appeals processes. The State Health Insurance Assistance ProgramExit Disclaimer  provides state specific information, referrals, and counseling to Medicare recipients and their caregivers.\n\n\n\nFor questions about Medicaid coverage, go to Medicaid.gov or call the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services at 1-877-267-2323. Medicaid gives health benefits to people with a limited income and their families. The program is run by each state, and therefore states may differ in who is eligible and in what benefits they cover. To learn what your state covers, see Contact Your State with Questions.\n\n\n\nLook online for guides that explain how insurance plans work. Some examples are:\n\n\n\n\t\nIf you don't have health insurance, visit HealthCare.gov. This is a database of healthcare coverage options provided by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Consumers can search online for health insurance options specific to their life situation and local community.\n\n\nIf you can’t afford insurance and are ineligible for Medicaid or Medicare, ask about charity care and sliding-scale programs (in which fees are based on your income) at hospitals and clinics. Some hospitals are required to see patients who are uninsured. Contact your local department of public health or social services, or the business office of your hospital of choice for more information.\n\n\n\n      \n\n              \n                    \n    Save Money on Pain Medicine\nCancer pain is a common side effect of cancer and its treatment. If the cost of pain medicine is an issue for you, talk to your doctor.  Doing so will interfere with your pain control. To save money on pain medicine, consider the following tips:\n\n\n\nThese usually cost less than brand-name medicines. You can also ask about the form of the drug. Pills may cost less than other forms of medicine.\n\n\n\nYou can’t get samples of opioids. But you can ask your doctor to write only part of the prescription. This way you can make sure that the medicine works for you before buying the rest of it. This will only help if you pay by the amount you buy. For some insurance plans, you pay the same amount for part of or the whole prescription. Find out what will work best for you.\n\n\n\nSome organizations and drug companies have special programs that help pay for prescription drugs. Ask your social worker about these programs.\n\n\n\nMany insurance companies offer the option of getting prescriptions through mail-order pharmacies. Sometimes mail order is cheaper than buying drugs at a local pharmacy. But first make sure that the medicine works for you. Also, be aware that you can’t order opioids in bulk or through the mail.\n\n\nNeedyMedsExit Disclaimer is a non-profit organization that connects people to programs that will help them afford their medicines or other health care costs. \n\n\n\n      \n\n              \n                    \n    Track Key Medical Information\n\n\n\n\n        \n    \n  \nAs challenging as it may be, having records of the medicines, tests, and treatments you receive is very important. It may be helpful for you to get systems in place for organizing information about your care from the very beginning of treatment. Here are some ways to keep track of the medical care you receive:\n\n\n\nKeep these in a file folder, or scan and save them on your computer. Other items to record are:\n\n\ndates of each medical visit\n\n\ttests and procedures received, with dates and results\n\n\ttreatments received, with dates\n\n\tside effects and symptoms you have had, with dates\n\n\tany medicines prescribed\n\n\tother supportive or complementary care received\nHere is a sample chart showing the type of information that is helpful to keep handy and up-to-date.\n\n\n\nSome health care providers, insurance companies, and employers give patients access to tools on the computer. For example, you can set up a personal health record (PHR) that allows you to enter, manage, and track important medical information. A PHR is similar to an electronic medical record that your doctor may keep, except that you are the one who keeps the PHR and controls who sees it.\n\n\n\nWrite down details about side effects or questions to ask the doctor. Bring it with you to medical visits to take notes and to refer back to.\n\n\n\nAsk if you can record the talks you have with your doctor with a recorder or mobile device to help you remember and track information. It will also make it easier for you to listen during the conversation itself, knowing you won’t miss anything.\n\n\n\nTrack daily events, appointments, and important dates to remember.\n\n\n\nThere are many apps that can help you remember and organize information. Look for them wherever you like to buy apps. For more information, go to HealthIT.gov.\n\n\n\n\nnames and contact information of the people on your health care team\n\n\tdiagnosis information, such as type and stage of your cancer\n\n\tyour treatment plan from your doctor\n\n\tpossible life-threatening side effects or changes in health to be aware of and for which urgent medical care should be sought\n\nIt’s not important which system or tool you choose, but that you use something to keep everything organized and easy to find.\n\n\n\n      \n\n              \n                    \n    Organize Medical Bills and Statements\nDevelop a system to track your medical bills and the EOB statements from your insurance company. Doing so may allow you to spot billing problems. Some ways to keep your bills and other financial paperwork organized include:\n\n\n\nIf you get your medical bills in the mail, put them in a single folder or binder. If you get your bills online, store them in a file folder on your computer. To be safe, print out hard copies to store in a separate folder as well.\n\n\n\nUse this account only to communicate with the hospital and the insurance company.\n\n\n\nFor example, you could keep a separate folder for each month, or a separate folder for each kind of paperwork.\n\n\n\nMatch each bill you receive to the EOB statement from your insurance company. Ask about any differences you see between the EOB and the bill. Always speak up if you think your bill is wrong.  You may find it helpful to keep a record of your conversations. Here is a sample chart to note the details of what you are told.\n\n\n\n      \n\n              \n                    \n    More Tips to Manage Costs\n\nExtra costs can result from unnecessary trips to the emergency room or hospital. It’s important to take care of yourself and follow the treatment and medicine plan your doctor prescribed for you. Doing so may limit trips to the hospital you don't need.\n\n\n\nMake sure you know how to care for yourself at home before you leave the hospital. If you don’t fully understand your discharge instructions, ask the staff to explain them to you again. Have someone with you who can also hear the instructions and take notes. The more information you have, the more you can avoid unnecessary visits to the doctor or emergency room.\n\n\n\nTravel costs can add up for patients and families. If the costs of transportation are an issue for you, talk to your social worker about organizations that provide rides or help with travel costs. Or contact NCI's Cancer Information Service at 1-800-4-CANCER for more information.\n\n\n\nThere are many online tools designed to help you manage your money. For example, the National Council on Aging has a BenefitsCheckUpExit Disclaimer to help you find benefits you may qualify for or programs that can save you money. It also has an EconomicCheckUpExit Disclaimer to help you budget your money and other tips. There are many tools available online, so choose one that feels right to you.\n\n\n\nStress can affect your physical health, which can mean more visits to the doctor and extra costs. If you feel upset and confused about financial issues or with the burden of having cancer in general, seek help early on. It’s important to ask for emotional and social support. Talk to friends and family about your stress. Let them know how you feel. Or ask for help from a social worker or other trained professional. They may be able to help you cope with your feelings.\n\n\n\nIf you have to manage financial issues on your own, it can take up a lot of your time. It might help to arrange automatic payments for monthly bills. Or seek help with errands or chores you have to do. For example, ask friends to pick up your kids, bring meals by occasionally, or run errands for you. Or ask if they could help out by making non-medical phone calls or writing notes.\n\n\nTo learn about what the research shows on the risk of having financial problems during cancer treatment, see the PDQ summary, Financial Toxicity (Financial Distress) and Cancer Treatment. Also see NCI's 2022 blog post on how people with advanced cancer often have financial problems due to the costs of their care. \n\n\n\n      \n\n    \n\n\n        \n\n    ",

But knowing your options will make it easier for you to move forward with your care. You can hope for the best while still being informed about your choices. (Your loved ones may also want to go to our caregiver section for more tips on talking about advanced cancer.)\n\n              \n    \n            \n          \n\n      \n\n              \n                    \n    Talking to Your Doctor about Advanced Cancer\nWhen you have a terminal cancer diagnosis, your doctor and other members of your health care team need to know what you\n want to know. Many people have a team of health care providers who work together to help them. It's important to sit down with them and talk things out together, so you can decide what is best for you\n. \n\n\n This team wants to know your goals for care at this stage of your cancer and how you would like to move forward. Tell them what is most important to you now. For example, is it:\n\n\ncontrolling symptoms and feeling comfortable?\n\n\treceiving care at home?\n\n\tbeing open to experimental treatments?\n\n\tsetting a date to attend a special event?\nTheir answers will help you know what to expect both now and in the future. For examples, see Questions to Ask Your Doctor about Advanced Cancer.\n\n\nIt's important to have good communication and an understanding of your goals with those who will be caring for you. Here are some topics you may want to discuss with your doctor or other members of your health care team:\n\n\n\n\tSome people want to know all the details about their care. Others prefer to know as little as possible. Some patients want to make all the decisions, while others want family members to make most of their decisions. What would you prefer?\n\n\t\n\tDecide what you want to know, how much you want to know, and when you’ve heard enough. Choose the amount of information that is most comfortable for you. Let your doctor and family members know what that is and ask that they follow your wishes.\n\n\t\n\tSome people assume that there will always be severe pain with advanced cancer. This does not have to be the case. Pain can be managed throughout the course of the disease. People whose pain is managed are able to focus on enjoying life. They can sleep better, enjoy friends and family, and focus on the daily activities they enjoy. It’s important to be honest and open about your pain. Tell your doctors if and where you have pain. To learn more about pain control, see Cancer Pain Control.\n\n\t\n\tSome family members may have trouble coping with your cancer prognosis. This is even more true when it is metastatic or terminal. They may not want to know how far the disease has advanced or how much time doctors think you have. If you feel comfortable, ask your family members how much they want to know about your condition. Then let your health care team know their wishes. Do this as soon as possible. It will help avoid conflicts or distress among your loved ones. If you haven't done so already, it is important to fill out advance directives.\nKnowing How Long to Live with Advanced Cancer\n\n\nIt's normal for people to want to know how long they will have to live. It's also natural to want to prepare for what lies ahead.\n\n\nBut no one knows the future. Predicting how long someone will live is difficult. Your doctor has to take into account the type of cancer, treatment, past illnesses, and other factors. Your doctor may be able to give you an estimate. But keep in mind that it's a guess. Every patient is different.\n\n\nSome patients live long past the time the doctor first predicted. Others live a shorter time. Also, an infection or other complication could happen and change things. Even the doctor can't know the answer for sure. And doctors don't always feel comfortable trying to predict how long someone will live.\n\n\nIn truth, none of us knows when we are going to die. Unexpected events happen every day. The best we can do is to try and live fully and for today.\n\n\n\n      \n\n              \n                    \n    Talking to Family and Friends about Advanced Cancer\nWhen you tell your loved ones that your cancer is terminal, they may need time to adjust to the news. They need to come to terms with their own feelings. These may include:\n\n\nconfusion\n\n\tshock\n\n\thelplessness\n\n\tanger\n\n\tsadness\nKnowing this will help you understand their feelings. Let people know that the best thing they can do for you is to be themselves and feel at ease with you. Ask them to listen when you need it, rather than try to solve every problem. Many people are comforted by sharing feelings and taking the time to say what they need to say.\n\n\nKeep in mind that not everyone can handle the thought that they might lose you. Or some people may not know what to say or do for you. As a result, relationships may change. This isn't because of you, but because others have trouble coping with their own painful feelings.\n\n\nSome things you could say if you'd like to:\n\n\nTell them that you’re still the same person you always were.\n\n\tLet them know if it's alright to ask questions or tell you how they feel.\n\n\tRemind them that often just being there for you is enough.\nIt's also okay if you don’t feel comfortable talking about these issues. What you say to others is up to you. You also get to decide when or if you want to respond at all.\n\n\n \n\n\nSee NCI’s Planning the Transition to End-of-Life Care in Advanced Cancer for additional information on care decisions and end-of-life planning.\n\n\n\n      \n\n              \n                    \n    Talking with Your Spouse or Partnerabout Advanced Cancer\nTalking about serious issues is never easy. It's hard to face an uncertain future and the possibility of death. Often people are uncomfortable or don't know what to say. \n\n\nIt’s likely that you and your loved one are both having the same thoughts and fears about the end of life. With an end-stage cancer diagnosis, there will come a time when you will need to talk about these issues together. These might include:\n\n\nwhen to stop cancer treatment\n\n\tpreparing for the future\n\n\ttalking about living arrangements and where to get care\n\n\tfears about death\n\n\twishes at the end of life\nThere is no right or wrong way to communicate. But studies show that people who talk things out feel better about the care they get and the decisions they make. A few things to remember are:\n\n\nYou can still have hope for comfort, peace, and acceptance. It's a good idea to talk about the fact that the future is uncertain. Avoiding important issues only makes them harder to deal with later. Talking over your concerns can bring comfort to both of you, as well as others in your life.\n\n\tBe honest about your feelings. It's important to get any thoughts or concerns you have out in the open.\n\n\tKnow that the way each person handles situations is different. You each have to process your thoughts and fears in your own time and own way.\nIf you have trouble talking about these issues, ask for professional advice. A counselor or other mental health expert may be able to help you and your loved one explore topics that you don’t feel able to on your own. You can also talk about other concerns and feelings that you are dealing with right now.\n\n\n\n      \n\n              \n                    \n    Talking with Your Children about Advanced Cancer\nChildren of all ages can sense when things are wrong. Keeping your children's trust is still very important at this time. It's best to be as open as you can about the fact that your cancer is terminal. They may worry that they did something to cause you to get sick. They may be afraid that no one will take care of them. They may also feel that you are not spending as much time with them as you used to.\n\n\nSome children become very clingy. Others get into trouble in school or at home. Let the child's teacher or guidance counselor know what is going on. It helps to keep all the lines of communication open, both with your kids and with the other people in their lives.\n\n\nAlthough you can't protect them from what they may feel, you can prepare them. If they ask if you are going to die, you can tell them the truth with comfort and understanding. What you tell them and how they take it will depend on their age and what they have gone through already in life. While you can't protect them from pain and loss, you can help them cope with it and understand it as part of life. Try to:\n\n\n Tell them you're sick and that the doctors are working to help you feel comfortable.\n\n\t And make sure they know that they can’t catch it from you or others.\n\n\t Tell them it’s okay to be upset, angry, or scared. Encourage them to talk.\n\n\t Children do not have the focus of adults. Use words they can understand.\n\n\t\n\n\tTell them you will answer them as honestly as you can. In fact, children who aren’t told the truth about an illness can become even more scared. They often use their imagination and fears to explain the changes around them.\n\n\n      \n\n              \n                    \n    Talking with Your Teenagers about Advanced Cancer\nMany of the things listed above also apply to teenagers. They need to hear the truth that your cancer is end-stage. This may help them from feeling guilt and stress. But be aware that they may try to avoid the subject. They may become angry, act out, or get into trouble as a way of coping. Others simply withdraw. Try to:\n\n\nThis is especially important if you have to rely on them more than before to help with family needs.\n\n\t\n\n\t Tell them they should keep taking part in sports and other fun activities.\nIf you have trouble talking with your teen about your cancer, you might want to ask for help. Try asking a close friend, relative, or health care provider for advice. You could also go to a trusted coach, teacher, or youth minister. Your social worker or doctor can help you as well.\n\n\n\n      \n\n              \n                    \n    Talking with Your Adult Children about Advanced Cancer\nYour relationship with your adult children may change when you learn that you have terminal cancer. You may have to rely on them differently than you have in the past. It’s a normal reaction if you find that this is hard for you. Many people find this difficult. After all, you may be used to giving support rather than getting it. Or it may be hard for other reasons. Perhaps your relationship with your children has been a more formal or distant one.\n\n\nAdult children have their concerns, too. They may become fearful of their own mortality. They may feel guilty because they’re overwhelmed by the many demands of their lives as parents, children, and employees and unable to be there with you as much as they want.\n\n\nAs your illness progresses, it helps to:\n\n\nShare decision-making with your children.\n\n\tInvolve them in issues that are important to you. These may include treatment choices, plans for the future, or types of activities you want to continue.\nReaching out to your adult children and openly sharing your feelings and wishes may help them cope with your cancer. It could bring you closer to them as well. It may also help lessen any fears or conflicts that may arise between siblings when important decisions need to be made.\n\n\nFor more detailed information on talking to children about cancer, see the NCI booklets, When Someone You Love Is Being Treated for Cancer and When Someone You Love Has Advanced Cancer.\n\n\n\n      \n\n              \n                    \n    Talking to Children about Death\nChildren of all ages may wonder about dying, life after death, and what happens to the body. If someone close to them has advanced cancer, their world may be changing monthly, weekly, or daily. That’s why it's important to be honest with them and prepare them each step of the way. \n\n\n If not, they may imagine things or make up their own stories. Let them know that everything is being done to keep you comfortable. \n\n\n Children deserve to be told the truth about a poor prognosis. Hiding the truth from them leaves them unprepared for your death and can prolong the grief they will feel. And if you don't talk about your condition or don't tell the truth about it, your children may have a hard time trusting others in the future.\n\n\nBy including children in the family crisis, you can give them healthy ways of coping with what is happening. You can show them how to hope for the best while accepting the likely outcome of death. If you're honest and up front, you're teaching them that death is a natural part of life. Your honesty shows them it’s okay to talk about death.\n\n\nCounselors and oncology social workers can also suggest ways to talk to kids about death in ways they understand. They may know of local or national programs that offer help to children in these situations. Or they may suggest books, videos, and websites that explore these topics.\n\n\n\n      \n\n              \n                    \n    Family Disagreements with Advanced Cancer\nAny problems your family may have had before the cancer diagnosis are likely to be more intense now that you have learned the cancer is terminal. And relatives that you or your family members don't know very well or who live far away may be around more often, which may complicate things.\n\n\nIt's common for families to argue over things such as:\n\n\ntreatment options or whether to continue treatment at all\n\n\twhen to use hospice care\n\n\tfeelings that some family members are helping more than others\n\n\tmoney issues\nAlthough everyone may be trying to do what's best, some family members may disagree as to what this means. Everyone brings their own set of beliefs and values to the table, which makes these decisions hard. It’s common for families to ask their health care team to hold a family meeting or to help with communication in some way.\n\n\n\n      \n\n              \n                    \n    Ask for Help or a Family Meeting\nOften, talking with the people closest to you is harder than talking with anyone else. Some families are good at communicating with each other. And others have trouble expressing their needs to each other, even if they get along very well. Or sometimes families simply don’t get along.\n\n\nIf you don't feel comfortable talking with family members, ask a member of your health care team to help start a conversation. You could also ask a social worker or other professional to hold a family meeting. This may help family members feel more comfortable to openly express their feelings. It can also be a time for you and your family to meet with your team to solve problems that may have arisen and set goals.\n\n\nIt can be very hard to talk about the goals for care when someone has terminal cancer. But studies show that cancer care goes more smoothly when everyone stays open and talks about the issues.\n\n\n\n      \n\n    \n\n\n        \n\n    ",

You may have had these emotions at other times in your life, too, but they may be more intense now. Everything changes when you learn that you have terminal cancer. Your thoughts may seem overwhelming at first. They may change each day or each hour. There’s no right or wrong way to feel or react. You may relate to all of the feelings below or just a few. You may feel them at different times, with some days being better than others.\n\n\n\n      \n\n              \n                    \n    Hope\nYou can still feel a sense of hope, despite your cancer. When you're told that remission may not be possible, you can hope for other things. These may include comfort, peace, acceptance, and even joy. Hoping may give you a sense of purpose. This, in itself, may help you feel better.\n\n\nTo build a sense of hope, set goals to look forward to each day. Plan something to get your mind off the cancer. Here are some tips from others with end-stage cancer:\n\n\nPlan your days as you’ve always done.\n\n\tSet dates and events to look forward to. \n\n\tSpend time with the people who matter to you most.\n\n\tDon’t stop doing the things you like to do just because you have cancer.\n\n\tFind small things in life to enjoy each day.\nDon't limit yourself. Look for reasons to hope while staying aware of what's at hand.\n\n\n\n      \n\n              \n                    \n    Sadness and Depression\nWith a terminal cancer diagnosis, you may feel sad more frequently than ever before. You may want to cry a lot and at unexpected times. Feeling sad may cause you to have no energy or not want to eat. Know that you don't have to be upbeat all the time or pretend to be cheerful in front of others. Do what feels natural to you.\n\n\nDepression can happen if sadness or despair seem to take over your life. Some of the signs of depression listed below are normal during a time like this. But it's a good idea to talk to your doctor if they last for more than 2 weeks. However, some of these symptoms could be due to physical problems. It's important to tell someone on your health care team about them because they can be managed, whatever the cause.\n\n\nSupportive Care Resources\n\n\nNCI's supportive care summaries cover feelings such as depression, anxiety, and grief.\n\n\nSigns of Depression\n\n\nfeeling helpless or hopeless, or that life has no meaning\n\n\thaving no interest in family, friends, hobbies, or things you used to enjoy\n\n\tlosing your appetite\n\n\tfeeling short-tempered and grouchy\n\n\tnot being able to get certain thoughts out of your mind\n\n\tcrying for long periods or many times each day\n\n\tthinking about hurting or killing yourself\n\n\tfeeling “wired,” having racing thoughts or panic attacks\n\n\thaving sleep problems, such as not being able to sleep, having nightmares, or sleeping too much\n\n\n      \n\n              \n                    \n    Grief\nYou may feel grief about having terminal cancer and the thought that you could be facing impending death. We all cope with loss or the threat of loss in different ways. How one person grieves may be different from another. It can vary depending on how you were raised or what culture you grew up in.\n\n\nSome of the symptoms of depression can also apply to grief. But grief can also be expressed through constant feelings of sadness, loneliness, anger, fear, and guilt. It can even affect the way you think. For example, you may:\n\n\nget easily confused, can't concentrate, or feel lost\n\n\thave thoughts that repeat themselves over and over again\n\n\tfeel low in energy or really tired\n\n\tfeel forgetful or have a hard time remembering things\n\n\tnot want to do things or see people\nThese are all very normal reactions to grief. What may help is to do the best you can to pace yourself. Accept that you're going through a lot right now and it's okay to feel what you feel.\n\n\nWhat you grieve for is as varied as how you think and feel. You may grieve for:\n\n\nthe loss of your body as it used to be\n\n\tthe things you used to be able to do\n\n\tplans you made that may not get fulfilled\n\n\tleaving your family and friends\nIt's okay to take time for yourself and look inward. It's also good to surround yourself with people who are close to you. Let your loved ones know if you want to talk. Or let them know if you just want to sit quietly with them or would rather be alone. There is no right or wrong way to grieve.\n\n\nOften, people who go through major change and loss need extra help. You can talk with a member of your health care team, a member of your faith community, or a mental health professional. You don't have to go through this alone.\n\n\n\n      \n\n              \n                    \n    Fear and Worry\nI have people around all day but there’s nothing worse than waking up alone and upset at 3:00 in the morning in a quiet, dark room. I have to have someone I can call right then.\n\n\nBen\n\n\nHaving end-stage cancer brings new fears and worries to life. Facing the unknown is very hard. You may be scared and concerned about:\n\n\nlosing control of your life\n\n\tbecoming dependent on other people\n\n\twhat will happen to your loved ones in the future\n\n\tbeing in pain or feeling sick\n\n\tfinancial issues\n\n\tdying\nAll these fears are normal for many cancer patients. It takes time to come to terms with your illness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n    \n  \nSome people say it helps if you:\n\n\n\n\tLearn more about your cancer and care options by asking questions of your health care team.\n\n\t\n\tIf you have not already done so, make sure your will, advance directives, and other legal paperwork are in order. Then you won’t have to worry about it.\n\n\t\n\tIf you can, talk with someone you trust. Or ask for help from the hospital social worker or counselor.\nIf you feel overwhelmed by fear, remember that others have felt this way, too. It's okay to ask for help. Fear can be managed.\n\n\n\n      \n\n              \n                    \n    Anger\nIt's very normal to ask, \"Why me?\" and be angry at the cancer. You may also feel anger or resentment towards:\n\n\nyour doctor and other members of your health care team\n\n\thealthy friends and loved ones\n\n\tif you're religious, you may feel angry with God\nAnger often comes from feelings that are hard to show, such as fear, frustration, and helplessness. Give yourself time to sort through these feelings. It's okay to feel angry and you don't have to pretend that everything is fine. It's not healthy to keep it inside you. But at some point, you don't want to shut people out either. When you’re ready, talk with your family and friends about why you’re angry. Or ask your doctor to refer you to a counselor to work through your feelings. \n\n\n\n      \n\n              \n                    \n    Guilt and Regret\nIt's normal for people with advanced cancer to wonder if they did anything to add to their situation. They may:\n\n\nblame themselves for lifestyle choices\n\n\tfeel guilty because treatment didn't work\n\n\tregret ignoring a symptom and waiting too long to go to the doctor\n\n\tworry that they didn't follow the doctor's advice in the right way\n You didn't fail the treatment. We can't know why cancer can be controlled in some people and not others. In any case, feeling guilty won't help—it can even stop you from moving forward with life plans or interacting with others.\n\n\nSo, it's important for you to:\n\n\ntry to let go of any mistakes you think you may have made\n\n\tfocus on things worthy of your time and energy\n\n\tlook at what you can control, not what you can't\n\n\tforgive yourself\nSome patients feel guilty that they’re upsetting the people they love by having terminal cancer. Others worry that they will be a burden on their families. If you feel this way too, take comfort in this:  They consider it a time when they can share experiences and become closer to one another. Others say that caring for someone else makes them take life more seriously and causes them to rethink their priorities.\n\n\nMaybe you feel that you can't talk openly about your feelings with your loved ones. If so, counseling or a support group may be an option for you. Let your health care team know if you would like to talk with someone.\n\n\n\n      \n\n              \n                    \n    Loneliness\nAs your cancer progresses, you may see family, friends, or coworkers less often and find yourself alone more than you would like. Or even if people are around, you may feel that they can't begin to understand what you're going through. Some people may even distance themselves from you because they have a hard time coping with your cancer. Others may think that you prefer to be left alone if you don’t feel well.\n\n\n Keep doing the things you've always done, the best you can. If you want more company, tell people that you don't want to be alone. Let them know that you welcome their visits. Ask that they reach out through mail, email, and telephone. You may also want to try joining a support group. There you can talk with others who share your feelings.\n\n\nFor more about feelings during cancer, see our Feelings and Cancer section.\n\n\n\n      \n\n              \n                    \n    Inner Strength\nYou may have felt overwhelmed and in shock when you first learned that your doctors couldn't control your cancer. But at some point your feelings of helplessness may change. You may find physical and emotional reserves you didn't know you had. People often find strength in finding things they can do for themselves, no matter how small. Calling on your inner strength may help you feel better.\n\n\nPeople work on their inner strength in different ways, such as:\n\n\nSome people find it helpful to focus on the present instead of the past or future. They accept that their daily routine may have to change.\n\n\tOthers like to think ahead and set goals. They make plans for places to go and things to do that they enjoy.\n\n\tSome focus on the relationships they have with people close to them.\nInner strength is different for each person. Draw on the things in your life that are meaningful to you.\n\n\n\n      \n\n    \n\n\n        \n\n    ",

It forms on the surface of the ovary in the epithelial cells or from the fallopian tube. It ranks fourth in cancer deaths among women and causes more deaths than any other cancer of the female reproductive system.\nOn the other hand, is an uncommon form of ovarian cancer, accounting for only about five percent of ovarian cancers. Germ cell cancers start in the cells that form the eggs in the ovaries. This cancer is usually found in adolescents and young women, and usually affects only one ovary.\nEqually rare, starts in the cells that produce female hormones and hold the ovarian tissues together.\nis a common inherited condition that causes 15–20 percent of all ovarian cancers and five to ten percent of all breast cancers. The association is so common that it is now recommended that women with epithelial ovarian cancer be tested for an inheritable mutation. This has implications for outcome, treatment, risk for breast cancer, and risk for family members. However, the implications of testing are complex enough that consultation with a genetic counselor is helpful.\n\n\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t   \t\t\t\t\t\t\t   \t\t\n\t\t   \t\t\t   \t\n\t\t   \t    \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOvarian cancer symptoms \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmore\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHistorically, ovarian cancer was called the “silent killer” because symptoms were not thought to develop until the chance of cure was poor. However, recent studies have shown this term is untrue and that the following signs are much more likely to occur in women with ovarian cancer than in women in the general population, even in patients with early-stage disease.\nBloating\nPelvic or abdominal pain\nDifficulty eating or feeling full quickly\nUrinary symptoms (urgency or frequency)\nWomen with ovarian cancer report that symptoms are persistent and represent a change from normal for their bodies. The frequency or number of ovarian cancer signs are key factors in the diagnosis of ovarian cancer. Several studies show that even early-stage ovarian cancer can produce these symptoms.\nWomen who have these symptoms almost daily for more than a few weeks should see their doctor, preferably a gynecologist. Prompt medical evaluation may lead to detection at the earliest possible stage of the disease. Early-stage diagnosis is associated with an improved prognosis. Several other symptoms have been commonly reported by women with ovarian cancer. These symptoms include fatigue, indigestion, back pain, pain with intercourse, constipation, and menstrual irregularities. However, these other symptoms are not as useful in identifying ovarian cancer because they are also found in equal frequency in women in the general population who do not have ovarian cancer.\n\n\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t   \t\t\t\t\t\t\t   \t\t\n\t\t   \t\t   \t\n\n\t\n\t\tMedical evaluation and diagnosis\nWhen a woman experiences concerning symptoms, a pelvic exam, including a rectovaginal exam, and a general physical exam should be performed. If the exam is abnormal, women should undergo a transvaginal or pelvic ultrasound to evaluate the ovaries, or a CT scan to look for distant disease.\nIf the exam is adequate and normal, it is reasonable to wait two to three weeks to see if the symptoms resolve. If they do not, then a transvaginal or pelvic ultrasound should be performed. If an abnormality of the ovaries is found, additional radiographic studies, such as a CT scan or an MRI, and a blood test for CA 125 may be performed. CA 125 is elevated in approximately 80 percent of women with advanced-stage epithelial ovarian cancer, but elevations can occur for reasons other than ovarian cancer. You can read more about CA 125 with our brochure, CA 125 Levels: Your Guide.\nIf ovarian cancer is suspected or diagnosed, it is important to seek care first from a gynecologic oncologist—medical doctors with specialized training in treating gynecologic cancers who can manage your care from diagnosis to completion of treatment. Use our Seek a Specialist tool to find a gynecologic oncologist in your area.\nSeek a Specialist\nDuring your treatment, you will come in contact with many health care professionals—these people make up your treatment team. They will work with each other and you to provide the special care you need. Learn more about your treatment team.\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\tSurgical staging\nWhen ovarian cancer is diagnosed, it is vital to determine if the cancer has spread beyond the ovaries. Your treatment team may do more tests to determine this. In addition, during surgery, certain additional steps should be performed to determine the extent of the disease. This process is called staging. \nFollowing surgery, your cancer will be categorized into Stage I, II, III, or IV. The cancer will also be assigned a grade. Grade refers to how abnormal the cells appear under a microscope. Low grade tumors, also called grade 1, have features that resemble normal ovarian cells. In contrast, in high grade tumors (grade 3) the microscopic appearance is greatly altered from normal.\nStudies show that patients treated by gynecologic oncologists at high-volume centers have improved outcomes.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tOvarian cancer stages \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tStage I\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t   \t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tStage II\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t   \t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tStage III\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t   \t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tStage IV\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t   \t\t\t\t   \t\n\n\t\t   \t\n\t\t   \t\n\n\t\t\t  \t\t\t\n          \t\t\t\t\tStage I: The cancer is found in one or both ovaries.

Whether surgery or chemotherapy is used first will depend on several factors specific to your disease. Only rarely is radiation therapy used. It is important to distinguish between early-stage ovarian cancer and advanced disease because the treatment approaches are different.\nAll treatments for ovarian cancer have side effects. Most side effects can be managed or avoided. Treatments may affect unexpected parts of your life, including your function at work, home, intimate relationships, and deeply personal thoughts and feelings.\nBefore beginning treatment, it is important to learn about the possible side effects, and talk with your treatment team members about your feelings or concerns. They can prepare you for what to expect and tell you which side effects should be reported to them immediately. They can also help you find ways to manage the side effects that you experience.\nAs you begin your treatment, make sure that you understand what to expect. Is this for cure? What are the chances of cure? If there is no cure, will the treatment make me live better or longer? It is very important to understand the truth about what to expect from the treatment—and what are the potential costs of side effects, expenses, etc.—so that you can make the best decisions for yourself and the life you want to lead.\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\tOvarian cancer treatment options\n\n\t        \t\t\n\t\t\t\t   \t\n\t\t   \t    \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSurgery\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmore\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSurgery is usually the first step in treating ovarian cancer and it should be performed by a gynecologic oncologist. Most surgery is performed using a procedure called a laparotomy during which the surgeon makes a long cut in the wall of the abdomen. Occasionally, early-stage ovarian cancer can be managed by laparoscopic surgery whereby multiple (1/2” to 3/4”) small incisions are made in the belly button or lower abdomen. Laparoscopic surgery sometimes can also be performed in women with advanced ovarian cancer.\nIf ovarian cancer is found, the gynecologic oncologist usually performs the following procedures:\nboth ovaries and fallopian tubes are removed.\nthe uterus is removed.\nincluding omentectomy, lymph node removal.\nremoval of any additional visible disease.\nFor staging, the omentum, a fatty pad of tissue that covers the intestines, is removed along with nearby lymph nodes and multiple tiny samples of tissues from the pelvis and abdomen.\nIf the cancer has spread, the gynecologic oncologist removes as much cancer as possible. This is called “debulking” surgery. Often this will involve extensive surgery, including removal of portions of the small or large intestine and removal of tumor from the liver, diaphragm, and pelvis. Removal of as much tumor as possible is one of the most important factors affecting cure rates.\nIf you have early stage I cancer and still hope to get pregnant, it may be possible to only remove one ovary and fallopian tube. Your future pregnancy wishes should be discussed with your gynecologic oncologist before surgery.\nIt is important to understand that the goals of surgery are to remove as much cancer as possible – with the best outcome if the surgeon can remove all visible cancer. In some cases, your surgeon may want to start with a laparoscopy to look inside to determine if the cancer can be optimally removed. In this case, the surgeon may proceed with the full operation and “debulking” or stop and plan for neoadjuvant chemotherapy to shrink the tumor(s) so that they can be removed after several treatments of chemotherapy.\nSome discomfort is common after surgery. It often can be controlled with medicine. Tell your treatment team if you are experiencing pain. Talk to your doctor if you are experiencing any other possible side effects, such as:\nNausea and vomiting\nInfection, fever\nWound problem\nFullness due to fluid in the abdomen\nShortness of breath due to fluid around the lungs\nAnemia\nSwelling caused by lymphedema, usually in the legs\nBlood clots\nDifficulty urinating or constipation\n\n\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t   \t\t\t\t\t\t\t   \t\t\n\t\t   \t\t\t   \t\n\t\t   \t    \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tChemotherapy\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmore\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tChemotherapy is the use of drugs to kill cancer cells. Chemotherapy for ovarian cancer is usually given intravenously (injected into a vein). You may be treated in the doctor’s office or the outpatient part of a hospital.\nThe drugs travel through the bloodstream to reach all parts of the body. This is why chemotherapy can be effective in treating ovarian cancer that has spread beyond the ovaries. However, the same drugs that kill cancer cells may also damage healthy cells, leading to side effects. Chemotherapy is usually given in cycles. Periods of chemotherapy treatment are alternated with rest periods when no chemotherapy is given. Most women with ovarian cancer receive chemotherapy for about 6 months following their surgery. In some cases, it may be appropriate to continue chemotherapy for a longer period of time to reduce the chance of the cancer returning.\nThere is another way to deliver chemotherapy, called . With IP chemotherapy, the medications are injected directly into the abdominal cavity in hopes of delivering a large dose directly to the tumor location. Usually, some of the chemotherapy is administered into the belly and some is still administered in the vein. Your surgeon may talk to you about placing a special catheter in your belly at the time of your operation if he/she feels that you could benefit from IP chemotherapy.\nIntraperitoneal chemotherapy is recommended for women with stage III ovarian cancer in whom all of the tumor spots bigger than 1 centimeter were removed with surgery. Recent studies have shown that while IP chemotherapy has more short-term toxicity, it is associated with a longer survival rate. It is important for you to talk with your team about the pros and cons of this approach.\nOccasionally, cancers will be advanced at initial diagnosis and your gynecologic oncologist may feel that surgery is unlikely to be as effective as desired, or that immediate surgery will be too difficult for you to tolerate. In this situation, chemotherapy treatments can be given to shrink the tumor before surgery takes place. This is called . Once there has been shrinkage of the tumor and your physical condition is improving, surgery is performed, usually followed by more chemotherapy. Since most women with ovarian cancer present with advanced-stage disease, which is determined by a clinical exam and imaging, a biopsy may be needed if neoadjuvant chemotherapy is going to be considered.\nEach person responds to chemotherapy differently. Some people may have very few side effects while others experience several. Most side effects are temporary. They include:\nNausea\nLoss of appetite\nMouth sores\nIncreased chance of infection\nBleeding or bruising easily\nVomiting\nHair loss\nFatigue\nNeuropathy (weakness, numbness, and pain from nerve damage)\n“Chemo brain” (memory lapses, problems with concentration)\n\n\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t   \t\t\t\t\t\t\t   \t\t\n\t\t   \t\t\t   \t\n\t\t   \t    \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRadiation therapy\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tmore\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRadiation therapy (also called radiotherapy) uses high-energy x-rays, or other types of radiation, to kill cancer cells or stop them from growing. Radiation therapy is not usually part of the first treatment plan for women with ovarian cancer, but may be used if the tumor returns.\nThe side effects of radiation therapy depend on the dose used and the part of the body being treated. Common side effects include:\nDry, reddened skin in the treated area\nFatigue\nDiarrhea\nDiscomfort when urinating\nNarrowing of the vagina\nAnemia\nMost of these side effects are temporary.

In these cases, hormone therapy may be a treatment option. Hormone therapy removes female hormones or blocks their action as a way of preventing ovarian cancer cells from getting or using the hormones they may need to grow. Hormone therapy is usually taken as a pill but can be given as a shot.\nThe side effects depend on the type of hormones being used.

For example, there are drugs that can block new blood vessel formation or target specific tumor enzymes to inhibit tumor growth. Many of these new agents are being investigated in clinical trials. Because these drugs block pathways that are more active in tumor cells, they are not as damaging to normal cells. Sometimes these targeted therapies are combined with chemotherapy to try to make the chemotherapy more effective. For patients, this often means fewer serious side effects, but targeted therapy drugs have their own unique side effects, which will be discussed by your team.\n\n\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t   \t\t\t\t\t\t\t   \t\t\n\t\t   \t\t   \t\n\n\t\n\t\t\nIn general, women are followed up with exams (including a pelvic exam) every 3 to 4 months for 3 years, and then every 6 months. In addition, CA 125 and imaging studies such as x-rays, CT scans, or MRIs may be periodically performed, especially if you have any new pains or symptoms.\nRecurrences are often diagnosed when the CA 125 level begins to rise, or new masses are found on imaging studies or by examination. A biopsy may be required to be certain a lesion is a recurrent tumor.\nIf ovarian cancer recurs, there are several options for treatment. These include repeat surgery, re-treatment with the same chemotherapy given initially, treatment with a different type of agent (chemotherapy, hormonal or targeted therapy), and sometimes radiation. As each recurrence will be different, it is important to discuss your individual situation with your team. It is also important to investigate whether there is a clinical trial that is appropriate for you. Don’t be afraid to seek a second opinion.\nA recent advance in ovarian cancer treatment is the successful use of poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors. This category of drugs is especially effective in patients with and mutations. Currently only one PARP inhibitor has received FDA approval for ovarian cancer patients who are positive. Several other PARP inhibitors are undergoing clinical trials. This advance underscores the strong recommendation that all women with ovarian cancer be tested for the mutations. This is important information for family members and can guide treatment options for patients.\nThere are many ongoing clinical trials studying new and better ways to treat ovarian cancer. Many treatment options are available today because women diagnosed with ovarian cancer were willing to participate in prior clinical trials.\nClinical trials are designed to test some of the newest and most promising treatments for ovarian cancer. The Foundation for Women’s Cancer partners with NRG Oncology (formerly Gynecologic Oncology Group), part of the National Cancer Institute cooperative group working only on gynecologic cancer clinical trials, and others to make information about current clinical trials available.

When serotonin binds to certain receptors in the brain, patients can experience nausea. Many anti-nausea drugs (antiemetics) work by blocking and shutting down these serotonin receptors.\nChemotherapy can also cause nausea and vomiting by stimulating NK-1 receptors in the brain. NK-1 receptor inhibitors help prevent acute and delayed nausea and vomiting.\nSteroids are also used to prevent nausea. Side effects can include jitteriness, but the doses used typically do not cause the effects of long-term steroid use, such as swelling and immune suppression.\nA recent study showed that nausea and vomiting are no longer the side effects that cause the most concern for patients undergoing chemotherapy, due to the effective medications that are available to prevent and treat these problems.\nPatients worry more about sleep loss and the effects of their illness on loved ones, the study showed.\n",

        "text": "Because chemotherapy kills rapidly dividing cells, it can affect hair follicles, resulting in hair loss. The degree, pattern and timing of hair loss vary among patients, as do changes that occur during hair regrowth. Some drugs, particularly certain chemotherapies, can cause profound hair loss, whereas targeted agents that are aimed directly at cancer cells usually won’t cause any. Patients should ask their doctors about what degree of hair loss to expect with treatment.\nIt’s normal for patients to feel distressed about losing their hair, which usually begins about two weeks after their first treatment. The scalp can become sensitive to washing, combing or brushing during the time when the hair is falling out. Facial hair, such as nasal hair, eyelashes and eyebrows, can also fall out, as well as hair on the arms, legs and pubic area.\nPatients who experience hair loss should do whatever feels comfortable, whether it’s wearing scarves, caps, hairpieces or wigs, or simply leaving the head bare. If thinking about wearing a wig or a hairpiece, patients should buy it before treatment or at the start of treatment, so the wig shop can match their hair color and texture. Many cities have professional stylists who will cut a wig or hairpiece to a patient’s preference.\nPatients should ask their doctors for a prescription for the wig because it might be covered by their health insurance. Hair should begin to grow back a few weeks after treatment ends.\nThose who are very upset by the prospect of losing their hair, or who want to keep their illness private by preserving their usual appearance, can consider using scalp cooling caps. Also known as scalp hypothermia or cold cap therapy, this technique involves cooling the scalp for a period of time before, during and after each chemotherapy treatment. This is thought to lessen the amount of drugs reaching the hair follicles, helping to prevent or reduce hair loss. The technique seems to work best in patients whose chemotherapy regimens do not include an anthracycline, such as doxorubicin.\nThe DigniCap Scalp Cooling System is approved for the reduction of hair loss during chemotherapy for patients with solid tumors. The Paxman Scalp Cooling System is approved to prevent hair loss in patients with solid tumors who are undergoing chemotherapy. Both can be purchased by hospitals, which can provide them to interested patients. DigniCap includes a cap attached to an automatic cooling system. It is becoming more widely available and its cost to each patient — $1,500 to $3,000 for the duration of chemotherapy — may be at least partially covered by insurance. Those interested can ask about availability at the facilities where they receive treatment.\nFor approximately $450 per month, its web- site states, patients who have any kinds of solid tumors can rent Penguin Cold Caps and bring them to chemotherapy appointments. The cheapest option — a few hundred dollars — is to buy several Elasto-Gel caps online, a cooler or two and some dry ice, and have a friend come to infusion appointments to help change the caps every 30 minutes before, during and after treatment.\nSome experts worry that cooling the head during treatment leaves open the possibility that cancer will spread to the scalp, but other oncologists say this is unlikely.\nPatients considering scalp cooling should confer with their doctors about whether it makes sense for them.\n"

Where it occurs depends on the location of treatment. Lymphedema most often affects the arms or legs, but, alternatively, it could affect the face, abdomen, neck or genitals.\nLymphedema is treatable through techniques such as specialized massage or the use of compression garments to help keep it under control.\nIt’s a good idea to ask your medical team, before treatment, whether you are at risk, and what you — and they — can do to help prevent lymphedema. One method is to use presurgical or other techniques that guide doctors in removing as few crucial lymph nodes as possible.\n"

This nerve damage can develop weeks, months or years after treatment and typically involves the fingers and toes, or the entire hand and foot. Symptoms may resolve completely, although it can take a few weeks to many months or even a couple of years as the nerves slowly heal. Some drugs can cause permanent neuropathy, and in rare cases, can also injure the auditory nerves, causing hearing loss.\nSensory neuropathy, the more common type, can cause pain, numbness, tingling or loss of sensation because it affects the nerves needed for touch, temperature and pain. Motor neuropathy results in a disruption of signals to the muscles and can lead to muscle weakness, clumsiness, balance problems and foot drop, a condition in which the front part of the foot is difficult to lift.\nPatients who develop neuropathy during chemotherapy should tell their doctors immediately. There may be things that can be done to help keep it from worsening and prevent permanent damage. Neuropathy may be treated with anticonvulsants or antidepressants because of their effects on certain chemical signals. A compounding pharmacy can prepare a topi- cal cream that might reduce the severity of side effects. Also available topically is an anesthetic patch, which can be applied to intact skin in the area with the most pain. In some cases, a change in the dose or type of anti-cancer drug might be necessary.\n"

        "text": "Management strategies are available for patients who experience cancer-related pain during and after treatment. Many cancer centers have pain and palliative care specialists. With the help of a doctor or pain specialist, patients can develop a personal pain management plan that might include relief strategies for long-term (chronic) and short-term (acute) pain, as well as brief, severe flare-ups called breakthrough pain.\nPatients with cancer who experience pain might need around-the-clock medication to prevent the pain rather than waiting to relieve it once it occurs. Long-acting medications continuously given or metabolized slowly in the body may be best for cancer-related chronic pain and can be combined with short-acting medication for acute and breakthrough pain.\nAlthough morphine is not used for all types of pain, and has side effects that can include constipation, drowsiness, itchiness, urinary retention and nausea, it may be the best choice for patients with cancer pain. Medications are also available to relieve symptoms caused by opioids. Because constipation is a common side effect of opioids, stool softeners and laxatives should be taken regularly. It might take time to reach a balance of pain relief and manageable side effects by gradually adjusting doses or trying different opioids. Many side effects improve once the body adjusts to the medication.\nPain relief patches that are applied to the skin for continuous release of medication over several days might be more convenient than oral medication, especially if patients have trouble swallowing. For example, narcotic patches can deliver opioids continuously through the skin for up to 72 hours. Some versions of the pain patch include a potent semisynthetic opioid that has milder side effects. Narcotics are also used for breakthrough pain and may be available in various formulations: as a lozenge, an effervescent tablet that is held between the cheek and gum, a mouth spray, a nasal spray and a dissolvable film placed on the inner cheek. For some less-common situations, pain specialists could use nerve blocks or drugs delivered to the spinal fluid.\nPatients who are worried about becoming addicted or have other concerns about taking pain medication should talk to their doctors or a pain specialist. Although the fear of addiction is common, very few patients become addicted to pain medication when it is taken properly. If patients have trouble getting the pain control they need, they should work with their treatment teams to get relief that works. In complicated cases where pain control is difficult to achieve, a pain specialist might be needed.\nThere have been few studies within the United States exploring the potential medical benefits of marijuana, or cannabis. The prescription, possession or sale of the substance is legal in some states but not in others. Where cannabis is legal for medical use, each state may have its own rules about which patients are eligible.\nA study whose results were published recently showed that one-quarter of patients with cancer who responded to a survey about marijuana reported using the substance to quell pain, nausea, stress or depression about their illness, or to stimulate appetite. The patients surveyed lived in a state in which medical marijuana was legal.\nIf you are considering using marijuana to ease side effects of your cancer or its treatments, speak confidentially with your doctor about the pros and cons, so that you can make an informed decision.\n"

RBCs are made from stem cells in the bone marrow and carry oxygen to the body’s tissues. Certain cancers, such as leukemia, lymphoma and myeloma, crowd out or suppress the production of healthy RBCs. Chemotherapy and radiation can damage the stem cells that make RBCs.\nIn some patients, low levels of RBCs or low hemoglobin levels — a measure of the ability of RBCs to carry oxygen — can be treated with genetically engineered erythropoietin (EPO), a protein produced normally in the kidneys. Certain drugs that act like natural EPO decrease the likelihood of a transfusion, but patients could still need one if their RBC levels dip dangerously low.\nBecause of serious side effects, the Food and Drug Administration does not recommend these drugs for treating anemia in patients who are not receiving chemotherapy or for those receiving chemotherapy as a curative treatment. It’s also recommended that they only be used with a goal of avoiding transfusions or severe anemia, rather than to try to get RBCs to a normal level.\n"

Drugs that activate granulocyte colony-stimulating factors (particles in the body that signal white blood cells to grow) are effective at reducing neutropenia, but they can produce a side effect of bone pain. Patients who develop neutropenia are advised to take special precautions to prevent infection until their white blood cell counts improve, including frequent hand washing, avoiding people who are sick and not eating raw fruits and vegetables. Patients who develop fever or display signs of infection during chemotherapy should notify their doctors immediately.\n"

        "text": "Immunotherapies, particularly those known as checkpoint inhibitors, hold a lot of promise as treatments for a variety of cancers. While these drugs are generally known for being easier to tolerate than chemotherapies, they are associated with a unique array of side effects. These reactions arise from inflammation caused by the stepped-up immune system harming some normal tissue.\nImmune-related side effects can include fatigue, headache, weakness, diarrhea, abdominal pain, constipation, skin rashes, itchiness, shortness of breath, cough, low blood pressure, high blood pressure, joint pain, hepatitis, inflammation of the liver, or hormonal problems such as an overactive or underactive thyroid or underactive pituitary gland.\nThese are most often treated with steroids, in some cases combined with temporary or permanent interruption of the immunotherapy. Imodium (loperamide) can treat milder diarrhea.\nHormonal imbalances caused by immunotherapy may end up being permanent, meaning that those affected will need to take hormone supplements indefinitely.\nA more severe autoimmune reaction, which may occur in people who take CAR-T cell therapies,is called cytokine release syndrome, and arises from the immune system attacking healthy organs while it attacks cancer cells.\nThis can cause side effects including serious heart and breathing problems, as well as brain issues such as confusion or the inability to understand speech.\nSteroids can be used to treat cytokine release syndrome induced by CAR-T cell therapy, and approved to treat severe cases is Actemra (tocilizumab), a monoclonal antibody that suppresses the immune system.\nSometimes, immunotherapy needs to be delayed or stopped because of side effects. Patients may worry about having to stop treatment, but they should be open with their care teams about side effects as soon as they occur. This can help doctors and others on the team to control side effects before they become severe.\nAll patients undergoing treatment are unique — as are the side effects they experience. Additional possible side effects include rash, cognitive dysfunction (also called chemo brain), mouth sores (oral mucositis), diarrhea, insomnia and low platelet counts (thrombocytopenia).\nPatients should ask their doctors about solutions for side effects they believe are associated with treatment — both physical and psychological. Also, they should ask for a name and phone number of a person to contact after hours should they experience these side effects.\n"

        "text": "Making Medical Decisions\nTaking the right steps can help patients handle the stress of treatment selection.\nThe doctor-patient relationship has changed. In times past, patients dutifully followed doctors' orders with few questions. Today, more patients are making medical decisions in partnership with their health decisions in partnership with their health care teams. It's not easy, due in part to the ever-increasing number of treatment options available.\nFor some patients, the right choice is treatment with a goal of cure, as long as there is some chance that outcome is possible, and regardless of the risks and costs of treatment. For others, cure is not the best goal because the chance of achieving that outcome is low and the price (discomfort, travel, expense, risk of death or complications) is high.\nDoctors can provide patients with statistical data for each treatment option regarding chances of remission, cure rates, complications, side effects and mortality. They might be able to give some idea of what the treatment experience will be like. Survivors who have been through similar treatments can usually offer insight into what to expect, and doctors can refer patients who are willing to share their recollections and advice.\nAs patients weigh their options and discuss them with their doctors, they should consider these steps:\n Patients shouldn't try to decide which choice is best at the time they receive their diagnosis—just identify as many options as possible, even if some seem far-fetched. Research indicates that most patients want complete medical information from doctors and to share the decision-making authority with them by creating a true partnership. Different doctors could recommend different drug or treatment combinations at various intervals. Then again, the best treatment might be no treatment. Patients diagnosed with certain slow-growing cancers may be given the option of being closely monitored (“watchful waiting”) if there are no serious symptoms.\n Once patients have a list of options, they should weigh the positives and negatives about each one. The goal is to know the risk versus the benefit of each option.\n Patients should find out as much as they can about each option by talking with their doctors and doing research. For a crash course in any cancer, as well as news of cutting-edge treatments, visit cancer.org, cancer.net or cancer.gov.\n Patients should make sure the resources they check are credible.\n A medical decision can mean different things to different people. Patients should understand how medical decisions can affect their quality of life and how these choices may affect their loved ones.\n It can be a tremendous relief for both patient and doctor once they settle on a treatment plan, but in the world of cancer, each decision carries a measure of uncertainty. Patients soon come to understand what oncologists have always known: Their treatments might or might not be effective. But in all cases, it is important that patients follow through with their plans, knowing that they are making the wisest choices they can at that time.\n"

        "text": "Understanding and Managing Long-Term and Late Effects\nWhen deciding on treatment, patients should also consider the risk of future health problems. \n For most patients, the actual treatment for cancer will be short-lived. Generally, the longer the cancer experience — from the first suspicious symptom to the final treatment appointment — the longer the time needed to recover from the physical and emotional ripple effects.\nThe post-treatment picture can vary substantially, depending on the type of cancer and treatment, and the long-term prognosis. For example, some cancer types might require ongoing treatment or follow-up surgery, such as reconstructive procedures, leaving the patient cancer-free, but not free of cancer’s effects.\nSome patients have lingering physical and emotional effects that began during treatment and continue afterward. Called long-term effects, these can include pain, neuropathy (nerve damage), lymphedema (swelling of the extremities), anxiety, sleep disturbances, cognitive dysfunctionand fatigue.\nOthers might have issues related to cancer or its treatment that emerge months or years after treatment has ended. These so-called late effects include such issues as secondary cancers, infertility and heart, bone or lung problems.\nWhile both adult and pediatric cancer survivors experience late effects, more is known about survivors of pediatric cancer because researchers have gathered long-term survival data for those cancer types for more than 20 years. Research into late effects experienced by adult survivors is complicated by the fact thatas people age, they develop other medical problems, or comorbidities, making it more difficult to determine if the problems are related to prior cancer treatment, aging or an interaction between the two.\nExamples of late effects are that one class of medications, known as anthracyclines, as well as the drug Herceptin (trastuzumab) for HER2-positive breast cancer, can cause damage to the heart.\nThese are some other problems that can occur:\nHigh blood pressure caused by drugs that target the vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF).\nLung damage from chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy to the chest.\nOsteoporosis or joint pain due to chemotherapy, steroids or hormonal therapy.\nBrain, spinal cord and nerve damage manifest- ing as hearing loss or increased risk of stroke, due to chemotherapy or radiation.\nDental problems due to chemotherapy, bone-protective drugs or radiation.\nVision problems due to steroids or some targeted therapies.\nDigestive disturbances due to chemotherapy, radiation or surgery.\nLymphedema, a pooling of liquid in limbs or other body parts due to surgery or radiation to the lymph nodes\nPeripheral neuropathy, nerve damage in the hands and feet from chemotherapy, which can cause numbness, weakness or pain\nThe damage is usually dose-dependent: The more of a drug a patient has, the more likely he or she will have a problem. Radiation presents another heart risk, since beams aimed at the chest to fight lymphoma, breast or other cancers can also reach the heart and lungs. Radiation can weaken or scar the heart muscle or damage its valves. It also can accelerate coronary artery disease, creating rough spots in the lining of the arteries where fatty plaque can accumulate.\nFoggy, unfocused thinking before, during or after chemotherapy, sometimes lasting months or years, is often referred to as “chemo brain.”\nChemo brain can involve trouble with memory, focus, details, common words and multitasking. High doses of chemotherapy are particularly associated with the problem, although other risk factors include lack of sleep, depression, anxiety, stress, medications, pain and its treatments, older age and other health conditions.\nTreatments for chemo brain can include psychostimulant medications and memory and attention training.\nOther ways to help counteract chemo brain include keeping a daily planner, doing word puzzles, getting enough sleep, getting physical exercise, eating vegetables, following routines and avoiding multitasking.\nAccepting your new normal and explaining it to friends and relatives can help, too.\nSome cancers and their treatments can have a significant effect on both sexuality and fertility, and knowing about these possibilities in advance can help patients and their doctors prepare for and choose therapies.\nIn addition to fear and worry, treatments can interfere with sexual activity. Patients may feel nauseated or fatigued from treatment, or may have physical problems or pain that interferes with sex due to treatment or its effects on hormones. They also may feel sensitive about changes in their bodies caused by surgery or other treatment.\nCommunication with your partner and choosing alternative forms of closeness can be important in supporting a sexual relationship in the face of these challenges.\nIn men, some treatments may cause erection or ejaculation problems. Some men experiencing these effects may benefit from supplements, medications or other treatments recommended by their doctors. Before getting therapy for cancer, men should talk to their doctors about the treatment’s anticipated effects on their fertility, and ask if they should consider preserving sperm if they want to father children after treatment.\nFor women, surgery and other treatments can affect physical appearance and sexual function. For example, hormonal changes may cause menstrual cycles to decrease or stop, and this can result in vaginal dryness and pain during sexual activity. Lubricants and other treatments or procedures should be discussed as options for these problems.\nBecause some treatments can cause problems with fertility, women who may want to have children after treatment should talk to their doctors about options for preserving their eggs.\nIf cancer returns, it is considered a recurrence of the primary cancer. When a survivor receives a diagnosis of a new primary, it might not be connected to treatment for the first diagnosis, or it might be a secondary cancer — one caused (or whose risk could have been increased) by treatment for the initial cancer.\nA second cancer can occur for a variety of reasons, most unrelated to past cancer treatment. For example, it is well known that breast cancer survivors with BRCA mutations are at higher risk for ovarian and other cancers, and current or former smokers who have survived other cancers have an increased risk of lung cancer.\nResearchers know that many patients who received a secondary cancer diagnosis experienced high doses of radiation to certain areas of the body or particular types of chemotherapy. For example, radiation is known to be a risk factor for breast cancer in women who had radiation to the chest area.\nResearchers have also concluded that some late effects tend to occur within a specific time period. For example, leukemia and other blood cancers caused by some chemotherapy drugs tend to develop within several years of treatment. By contrast, the risk of developing a new solid tumor continues to increase even 10 years after therapy.\nSome survivors of breast cancer who underwent mastectomy and then reconstruction using textured breast implants have developed a blood cancer called breast implant-associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma (BIA-ALCL). A specific product line associated with this condition has been recalled, but patients planning reconstruction should receive a written warning from their plastic surgeons spelling out the risks associated with implants, and should confirm that these doctors are familiar with BIA-ALCL and how to treat it.\nWhat Is Cancer?\nBladder Cancer\nChronic Lymphocytic Leukemia\n"

        "text": "Millions of Americans care for a loved one with cancer every year, with one in three caregivers dedicating time every week that is equivalent to a full-time job. While caregiving allows for an opportunity to provide for someone you love, the long-term stresses of caregiving can lead to physical and emotional exhaustion.\nThings to Consider to Avoid Burnout\nAlso called compassion fatigue, caregiver burnout can cause you to act less caring than you normally would. This can lead to feelings of guilt and anxiety, which can lead to poorer health outcomes for both yourself and your loved one.\nIt’s important to remember that these experiences are not uncommon. Your feelings are valid and real, and acknowledging them is an important first step in any effort to refresh yourself. Even though caregiving can feel overwhelming at times, there are still things you can do to help yourself:\n Reaching out to others for help can feel intimidating, especially when you’re not sure what others could and are willing to provide. Create a list of tasks you need assistance with and reach out to friends and family to find specific ways that each person can help.\n In some cases, professional home care or a palliative care agency may help alleviate some of your medical duties. Contact your loved one’s insurance provider to assess their home health care benefits.\n Finding a spare moment as a caregiver can be difficult, but savoring the short breaks can make a difference. There’s nothing wrong with enjoying these private moments for yourself.\n Burnout and exhaustion often come from overexerting yourself, physically or emotionally. If you feel like you’re doing too much, you probably are. Prioritize the things that need to get done and say “no” to activities that can wait for later.\n In prioritizing what needs to get done, don’t forget to put yourself and your well-being on that list. Whether it be basic things like getting restful sleep, going for a walk, practicing a hobby you enjoy or going to a yoga class, make sure to find a good balance of saying “yes” to your needs alongside your caregiving obligations.\n Mindfulness involves being present with your emotions and letting them proceed without interference or judgment. This practice has been shown to have some benefit on both physical and mental health. Meditation is a great way to be mindful; phone apps like Calm can help you get started.\n Joining a support group of cancer caregivers can provide space to process your caregiving experiences with people who understand. Ask someone on your loved one’s treatment team for a referral to a local, in-person group. Support groups are also available online, over the phone and in-person through CancerCare\n and other organizations.\n Oncology social workers are licensed professionals who specialize in individualized and group counseling with people affected by cancer. CancerCare\n’s oncology social workers can help you in proactive coping, which may help you reduce symptoms and feelings of burnout. For long-term support, you can consult an online directory or your health insurance provider to find a counselor in your area. Remember, it’s not necessary to have a cancer diagnosis of your own to seek out such support.\nEdited by Mary Hanley, LMSW\n"

        "text": "Overview\n\n        When you learn you have advanced cancer, you’re faced with many decisions about your end-of-life care. Talking about these decisions early can make it easier on you and your family later. The following are some questions you may want to think about:\nWhat’s important to you during this time?\nIs it most important that you be as comfortable and alert as possible during the last stages of cancer?\nIs it most important to continue with  treatments that may help you live longer but make you uncomfortable?\nSome patients choose to receive all possible treatments. Others  choose to receive only some treatments or no treatment at all.  Some choose to receive only care that will keep them comfortable. Having information about your options will help you make these choices.  Together, you, your family, and your doctor can decide on a plan for your care during the advanced stages of cancer.\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n        Quality Care at the End of Life\n\n        Key Points\nYou decide what quality care at the end of life means for you. \nMake end-of-life care decisions early.\nYou decide what quality care at the end of life means for you. \nYour care continues even after all treatments have stopped. End-of-life care is more than what happens moments before dying. Care is needed in the days, weeks, and sometimes even months before death. During this time, many patients feel it's important to:\nHave their pain and symptoms controlled.\nAvoid a long process of dying.\nFeel a sense of control over what is happening to them.\nCause less emotional and financial burden on the family.\nBecome closer with loved ones.\nYour doctors and family need to know the kind of  end-of-life care you want. \nMake end-of-life care decisions early.\nYou may be able to think about your options more clearly if you talk about them before the decisions need to be made. It's a good idea to let your doctors, family, and caregivers know your wishes before there is an emergency.\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n        End-of-Life Care Decisions To Be Made\n\n        Key Points\nCare decisions for the last stages of cancer can be about treatments and procedures, pain control, place of care, and spiritual issues.Chemotherapy\nPain and symptom control\nCardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)\nVentilator use\nReligious and spiritual support\nCare decisions for the last stages of cancer can be about treatments and procedures, pain control, place of care, and spiritual issues.\nChemotherapy\nSome patients choose to begin new chemotherapy treatment in the end stages of cancer.  Others wish to let the disease  take its course when a cure is not expected. In the end stages of cancer, chemotherapy usually doesn't help you live longer and it may lower the quality of the time that remains. Each person and each cancer is different. Talking with your doctor about the  effects  of treatment and your quality of life can help you make a decision. You can ask if the treatment will make you comfortable or if it  will help you live longer. \nPain and symptom control\nControlling pain and other symptoms can help you have a better quality of life in the end stages of cancer. Pain and symptom control can be part of your care in any place of care, such as the hospital, home, and hospice.\nCardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)\nIt's important to decide if you will want to have cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). CPR is a procedure used to try to restart the heart and breathing when it stops.   In advanced cancer, the heart, lungs, and other organs begin to fail and it's harder to restart them with CPR. Your doctor can help you  understand how CPR works and talk with you about whether CPR is likely to work for you.\nPeople who are near the end of life may choose not to have CPR done. Your decision about having CPR is personal. Your own spiritual or religious views about death and dying may help you decide. If you decide you don’t want CPR, you can ask your doctor to write a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) order. This tells other health care professionals not to perform CPR if your heart or breathing stops. You can remove the DNR order at any time.   \nTalk with your doctors and other caregivers about CPR as early as possible (for example, when being admitted to the hospital), in case you’re not able to make the decision later.  If you do choose to have your doctor write a DNR, it’s important to tell all your family members and caregivers about it.\nIn the United States, if  there is no DNR order,  you will be given CPR  to keep you alive.\nVentilator use\nA ventilator is a machine used to help you breathe and keep you alive after normal breathing stops. It  doesn't treat a disease or condition. It's used only for life support. You can tell doctors whether you would want to be put on a ventilator if your lungs stop working  or if you cannot breathe on your own after CPR. If your goal of care is to live longer, you may choose to have a ventilator used. Or you may choose to \n\nhave a ventilator for only a certain length of time.  It's important to tell your family and health care providers what you want before you have trouble breathing. \n\nFor more information, see the section on ventilator use in the PDQ summary on Last Days of Life.\nReligious and spiritual support\nYour religious or spiritual beliefs may help you with end-of-life decisions. Clergy and chaplains can give counseling. You can also talk with a member of your church, a social worker, or even other people who have cancer.\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n        Talking with Your Doctor About End-of-Life Care\n\n        Key Points\nYou may need to start the conversation. \nPrognosis,  treatment goals, and making decisions  are some of the end-of-life issues to discuss with your doctor.\nEarly communication with your doctors can help you feel more prepared for end-of-life issues.\nThere are ways to improve communication with your doctors.\nYou may need to start the conversation. \nSome doctors don't ask patients about end-of-life issues. If you want to make choices about these issues, talk with your doctors so that your wishes can be carried out. Open communication can help you and your doctors make decisions together and create a plan of care that meets your goals and wishes. If your doctor is not comfortable talking about end-of-life plans, you can talk to other specialists for help. (See the PDQ summary on Communication in Cancer Care.)\nPrognosis,  treatment goals, and making decisions  are some of the end-of-life issues to discuss with your doctor.\nHaving a good understanding of your prognosis is important when making decisions about your care and treatment during advanced cancer. You will probably want to know how long you have to live. That's a hard question for doctors to answer. It can be different for each person and depends on  the type of cancer, where it has spread, and whether you have other illnesses. Treatments can work differently for each person.   Your doctor can talk about the treatment options with you and your family and explain the effects they may have on  your cancer and your quality of life. Knowing the benefits  and risks of  available treatments can help you decide on your goals of care for the last stages of the cancer. \nYour care goals for advanced cancer depend in part on whether  quality of life or length of life is more important to you. Your goals of care may change as your condition changes or if new treatments become available.  Tell your doctor what your goals of care are, even if you aren't asked. It's important that you and your doctor are working toward the same goals.  \nDo you want to take part in making the decisions about your care? Or would you rather have your family and your doctors make those decisions? This is a personal choice and your family and doctors need to know what you want. \nEarly communication with your doctors can help you feel more prepared for end-of-life issues.\nMany patients who start talking with their  doctors early about end-of-life issues report feeling better prepared. Better communication with your doctors may make  it easier to deal with concerns about  being older, living alone, relieving symptoms, spiritual well-being, and  how your family will cope in the future.\nThere are ways to improve communication with your doctors.\nTell your doctor how you and your family wish to receive information and the type of information you want. Also ask how you can get information at times when you can't meet face-to-face. \nRemembering what your doctor said and even remembering what you want to ask can be hard to do. Some of the following may help communication and help you remember what was said:\nHave  a family member go with you when you meet with your doctor.\nMake a list of the questions you want to ask the doctor during your visit. \nGet the information in writing.\nRecord the discussion with tape recorders, smart phones, or on video. \nAsk if your doctor or clinic offers any of the following:A cancer consultation preparation package, which includes aids such as a question idea sheet, booklets on decision making and patient rights, and information about the clinic.\nA talk with a  psychologist about advance planning and end-of-life issues.\nAn end-of-life preference interview, which includes a list of questions that can help you explain your wishes about the end of life.\n \n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n        Supportive Care, Palliative Care, and Hospice\n\n        Key Points\nEven when treatments can no longer cure the cancer, medical care is still needed.Supportive care\nPalliative  care\nHospice care\nEven when treatments can no longer cure the cancer, medical care is still needed.\nSome of the end-of-life care options are supportive care, palliative care, and hospice.\nSupportive care\nSupportive care is given to prevent or treat, as early as possible, the symptoms of the cancer, side effects caused by treatments, and psychological, social, and spiritual problems related to the cancer or its treatment. During active treatment to cure the cancer, supportive care helps you stay healthy and comfortable enough to continue receiving the cancer treatments. In the last stages of cancer, when a cure is no longer the goal, supportive care is used for side effects that continue.\nPalliative  care\nPalliative care is specialized medical care for people with serious or life-threatening illnesses. The focus of palliative care is relief from pain and other symptoms, both during active treatment and when treatment has been stopped. Palliative care is offered in some hospitals, outpatient centers, and in the home.\n\nPalliative care helps to improve your quality of life by preventing and relieving suffering. When you're more comfortable, your family's quality of life may also be better.  Palliative care includes treating physical symptoms such as pain, and helping you and your family with emotional, social, and spiritual concerns. When palliative treatment is given at the end of life, the focus is on relieving symptoms and distress caused by the process of dying and to make sure your goals of care are followed.\nHospice care\nWhen treatment is no longer helping, you may choose hospice. Hospice is a program that gives care to people who are near the end of life and have stopped treatment to cure or control their cancer. Hospice care focuses on quality of life rather than length of life. The hospice team offers physical, emotional, and spiritual support for patients who are expected to live no longer than six months. The goal of hospice is to help patients live each day to the fullest by making them comfortable and relieving their symptoms. This may include supportive and  palliative care to control pain and other symptoms so you can be as alert and comfortable as possible. Services to help with the emotional, social, and spiritual needs of you and your family are also an important part of hospice care.\nHospice programs are designed to keep the patient at home with family and friends, but hospice care may also be given in hospice centers and in some hospitals and nursing homes. The hospice team includes doctors, nurses, spiritual advisors, social workers, nutritionists, and volunteers. Team members are specially trained on issues that occur at the end of life. The hospice program continues to give help, including grief counseling, to the family after their loved one dies. Ask your doctor for information if you wish to receive hospice care.\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n        Advance Planning\n\n        Key Points\nMaking end-of-life care decisions early can ease your mind and decrease stress on your family.\nAdvance directives are  documents that state what your wishes are for certain medical treatments when you can no longer communicate those wishes.\nAll your caregivers need to have copies of your advance directives.\nYou can change or cancel an advance directive at any time.\nMaking end-of-life care decisions early can ease your mind and decrease stress on your family.\nThere may come a time when you can't tell the health care team what you want. When that happens, would you prefer to have your doctor and family make decisions? Or would you rather make decisions early, so your wishes will be known and can be followed when the time comes?  If not planned far ahead of time, the end-of-life decisions must be made by someone other than you. \nPlanning ahead for end-of-life care helps with the following:\nMakes sure your doctors and family know what your wishes are.\nAllows you to refuse the use of treatments.\nDecreases the emotional stress on your family, who would have to make decisions if you aren't able to. \nReduces the cost of care, if you choose not to receive life-saving procedures.\nEases your mind to have these decisions already made.\nYou can make your wishes known with an advance directive.\nAdvance directives are  documents that state what your wishes are for certain medical treatments when you can no longer communicate those wishes.\n Advance directive is the general term for different types of documents that state what your wishes are for certain medical treatments when you can no longer tell those wishes to your caregivers. In addition to decisions about relieving symptoms at the end of life, it is also helpful to decide if and when you want certain treatments to stop. Advance  directives make sure your wishes about treatments and life-saving procedures to keep you alive are known ahead of time. Without knowing your wishes, doctors will do everything medically possible to\nkeep you alive, such as cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and the use of a ventilator (breathing machine).\nEach state has its own laws for advance directives. Make sure your advance directives follow the laws of the state where you live and are being treated. State-specific advance directives can be downloaded from the Caring ConnectionsExit Disclaimer section of the National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization websiteExit Disclaimer.\nThe following are types of documents that communicate your wishes in advance:\n: A legal document that states whether you want certain life-saving medical treatments to be used or not used under certain circumstances.  Some of the treatments covered by a living will include CPR, use of a ventilator (breathing machine), and tube-feeding. \n: A document in which you choose a person (called a proxy) to make medical decisions if you become unable to do so. It's important that your proxy  knows your values and wishes, so that he or she can make the decisions you would make if you were able. You do not have to state specific decisions about individual treatments in the document, just state that the proxy will make medical decisions for you. HCP is also known as durable power of attorney for health care (DPOAHC) or medical power of attorney (MPOA).\n: A document that tells medical staff in the hospital not to do cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) if your heart or breathing stops. (See the Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) section, above, for more information.) A DNR order is a decision only about CPR. It does not affect other treatments that may be used to keep you alive, such as medicine or food.\n A document that tells emergency medical workers outside of a hospital that you do not  wish to have CPR or other types of resuscitation. Each state has its own rules for a legal out-of-hospital DNR order, but it is usually signed by the patient, a witness, and the doctor. It's best to  have several copies so one can quickly be given to emergency medical workers when needed.\n A document that tells medical staff in a hospital or nursing facility that you do not wish to have a breathing tube inserted and to be put on a ventilator (breathing machine).\n: A form that states what kind of medical treatment you  want toward the end of your life. It is signed by you and your doctor.\n: A form that states the care you would like to receive if you are not able to communicate. This care includes CPR, intubation (breathing tubes), and other life-saving procedures.  Under current law, the information in a MOLST form must be followed both in the home and hospital by all medical staff, including emergency medical workers.\nAll your caregivers need to have copies of your advance directives.\nGive copies of your advance directives to your doctors, caregivers, and family members. Advance directives need to move with you.\n\nIf your doctors or your place of care changes, copies of your advance directives need to be given to your new caregivers. This will make sure that your wishes are known through all cancer stages and places of care.\nYou can change or cancel an advance directive at any time.\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n        The Transition to End-of-Life Care\n\n        The word transition\n can mean  a passage from one place to another. The transition or change from looking toward recovery to receiving end-of-life care is not an easy one and there are important decisions to be made. If you become too sick before you have made your wishes known, others will make care and treatment  decisions for you, without knowing what you would have wanted. It may be less stressful for everyone if you, your family, and your health care providers have planned ahead for this time.\nThe goal of end-of-life care is to prevent suffering and relieve symptoms. The right time to transition to end-of-life care is when this supports your changing condition and changing goals of care.\nThere are certain times when you may think about stopping treatment and transitioning  to comfort care. These include:\nFinding out that the cancer is not responding to treatment and that more  treatment is not likely to help.\nHaving poor   quality of life  due to  the side effects or complications of treatment.\nBeing unable to carry out daily activities when the disease progresses.\n  Together with your doctor, you and your family members can share  an understanding about treatment choices and when transition to end-of-life care is the best choice.    When you make  the decisions and plans,  doctors and family members can be sure they are doing what you want.\nFor more information about the end of life, see the PDQ summary on Last Days of Life.\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n        To Learn More About Planning for End-of-Life Care\n\n        \n\n    \n",

The PDQ database contains summaries of the latest published information on cancer prevention, detection, genetics, treatment, supportive care, and complementary and alternative medicine. Most summaries come in two versions. The health professional versions have detailed information written in technical language. The patient versions are written in easy-to-understand, nontechnical language. Both versions have cancer information that is accurate and up to date and most versions are also available in Spanish.\nPDQ is a service of the NCI. The NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). NIH is the federal government’s center of biomedical research.  The PDQ summaries are based on an independent review of the medical literature. They are not policy statements of the NCI or the NIH.\nPurpose of This Summary\nThis PDQ cancer information summary has current information about planning for  end-of-life care in advanced cancer.  It is meant to inform and help patients, families, and caregivers. It does not give formal guidelines or recommendations for making decisions about health care.\nReviewers and Updates\nEditorial Boards write the PDQ cancer information summaries and keep them up to date. These Boards are made up of experts in cancer treatment and other specialties related to cancer. The summaries are reviewed regularly and changes are made when there is new information. The date on each summary (\"Updated\") is the date of the most recent change.\nThe information in this patient summary was taken from the health professional version, which is reviewed regularly and updated as needed, by the PDQ Supportive and Palliative Care Editorial Board.\nClinical Trial Information\nA clinical trial is a study to answer a scientific question, such as whether one treatment is better than another. Trials are based on past studies and what has been learned in the laboratory. Each trial answers certain scientific questions in order to find new and better ways to help cancer patients. During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works. If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become \"standard.\" Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.\nClinical trials can be found online at NCI's website.

        "text": "Overview\n\n        The end of life may be months, weeks, days, or hours. It   is a time when many decisions about treatment and care are  made for patients with cancer. It is important for  families and healthcare providers to know the patient's wishes ahead of time and to talk with the patient openly about end-of-life plans. This will help make it easier for family members to make major decisions for the patient at the end of life.\nWhen treatment choices and plans are discussed before the end of life, it can lower the stress on both the patient and the family.   It is most helpful if end-of life planning and decision-making begin soon after the cancer is diagnosed and continue during the course of the disease. Having these decisions in writing can make the patient's wishes clear to both the family and the healthcare team. \nWhen a child is terminally ill, end-of-life discussions with the child's doctor may reduce the time the child spends in the hospital and help the parents feel more prepared.\nThis summary is about end of life in adults with cancer and where noted, children with cancer. It discusses care during the last days and last hours of life, including treatment of common symptoms and ethical questions that may come up. It may help patients and their families prepare for decisions that     they need to make during this time. \n See the PDQ summary on Planning the Transition to End-of-Life Care in Advanced Cancer for more information on end-of-life planning, including palliative and hospice care.\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n        Care in the Final Hours\n\n        Key Points\nKnowing what to expect in the final days or hours helps comfort the family.\nPatients may not want to eat or drink in the final days or hours.\nPatients near death may not respond to others.\nA number of physical changes are common when the patient is near death.\nPatients and their families may have cultural or religious beliefs and customs that are important at the time of death.\nKnowing what to expect in the final days or hours helps comfort the family.\nMost people don't know the signs that show death is near. Knowing what to expect can help them get ready for the death of their loved one and make this time less stressful and confusing. Healthcare providers can give family members information about the changes they may see in their loved one in the final hours and how they may help their loved one through this. \nPatients may not want to eat or drink in the final days or hours.\nIn the final days to hours of life, patients often lose the desire to eat or drink, and may not want food and fluids that are offered to them. The family may give ice chips or swab the mouth and lips to keep them moist. Food and fluids should not be forced on the patient. This can make the patient uncomfortable or cause choking.  \nPatients near death may not respond to others.\nPatients may withdraw and spend more time sleeping. They may answer questions slowly or not at all, seem confused, and may not be interested in what's going on around them. Most patients are still able to hear after they are no longer able to speak.  It may give some comfort if family members continue to touch and talk to the patient, even if the patient does not respond.\nA number of physical changes are common when the patient is near death.\nCertain physical changes may occur in the patient at the end of life: \nThe patient may feel tired or weak.\nThe patient may pass less urine and it may be dark in color.\nThe patient’s hands and feet may become blotchy, cold, or blue. Caregivers can use blankets to keep the patient warm. Electric blankets or heating pads should not be used.\nThe heart rate may go up or down and become irregular.\nBlood pressure usually goes down. \nBreathing may become irregular, with very shallow breathing, short periods of not breathing, or deep, rapid breathing. \nHowever, these  signs and changes don't always occur in everyone. For this reason, it may be hard to know  when a patient is near death.\nPatients and their families may have cultural or religious beliefs and customs that are important at the time of death.\nAfter the patient dies, family members and caregivers may wish to stay with the patient a while. There may be certain customs or rituals that are important to the patient and family at this time. These might include rituals for coping with death, handling the patient's body, making final arrangements for the body, and honoring the death. The patient and family members should let the healthcare team know about any customs or rituals they want performed after the patient's death.\nHealthcare providers, hospice staff, social workers, or spiritual leaders can explain the steps that need to be taken once death has occurred, including contacting a funeral home.\nSee the PDQ summary on Spirituality in Cancer Care for more information.\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n        Symptoms During the Final Months, Weeks, and  Days  of Life\n\n        Key Points\nDeliriumDelirium can have many causes at the end of life.\nDelirium may be controlled by finding and treating the cause.\nHallucinations that are not related to delirium often occur at the end of life.\nFatigueFatigue is one of the most common symptoms in the last days of life.\nShortness of BreathFeeling short of breath is  common and may get worse during the final days or weeks of life.\nThe use of opioids and other methods can help the patient breathe more easily.\nPainPain medicines can be given in several ways.\nPain during the final hours of life can usually be controlled. \nCoughCough at the end of life can be treated in several ways.\nConstipationConstipation may occur  in the last days of life.\nTrouble SwallowingPatients may have trouble swallowing food and fluids at the end of life.\nDeath RattleRattle occurs when saliva or other fluids collect in the throat and upper airways.\nNon-drug treatments for rattle include changing the patient's position and giving less   fluid.\nDeath rattle is a sign that death may soon occur.\nMyoclonic JerkingMyoclonic jerks  may be caused by taking very high doses of opioids for a long time.\nFeverFever may be caused by infection, medicines, or the cancer itself.\n HemorrhageSudden hemorrhage (heavy bleeding) may occur in patients who have certain cancers or disorders.\nMaking the patient comfortable  is the main goal of care during hemorrhage at the end of life. \nCommonsymptoms at the end of lifeinclude the following:\nDelirium.\nFeeling very tired.\nShortness of breath.\nPain.\nCoughing.\nConstipation.\nTrouble swallowing.\nRattle sound with breathing.\nMyoclonic jerks.\nFever.\nHemorrhage.\nDelirium\nDelirium can have many causes at the end of life.\nDelirium is common during the final days of life. Most patients have a lower  level of consciousness. They may be withdrawn, be less alert, and have less energy. Some patients may be agitated or restless, and have  hallucinations (see or hear things not really there). Patients should be protected from having accidents or hurting themselves when they are confused or agitated. See the PDQ summary on      Delirium for more information.\nDelirium can be caused by the direct effects of cancer, such as a growing tumor in the brain. Other causes include the following: \n\nA higher- or lower-than-normal amount of certain chemicals in the blood  that keep the heart, kidneys, nerves, and muscles working the way they should. \nSide effects of drugs or drug interactions (changes in the way a drug acts in the body when taken with certain other drugs, herbal medicine, or foods).\nStopping the use of certain drugs or alcohol.\nDehydration (the loss of needed water from the body).\nDelirium may be controlled by finding and treating the cause.\nDepending on the cause of the delirium, doctors may do the following:\nGive drugs to fix the level of certain chemicals in the blood.\nStop or lower the dose of the drugs that are causing delirium, or are no longer useful at the end of life, such as drugs to lower cholesterol.\nTreat dehydration by putting fluids into the bloodstream.\nFor some patients in the last hours of life, the decision may be to  treat only the symptoms of delirium and make the patient as comfortable as possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are drugs that work very well to relieve these symptoms. \nHallucinations that are not related to delirium often occur at the end of life.\n  It is common for dying patients to have  hallucinations that include loved ones who have already died. It is normal for family members to feel distress when  these hallucinations occur. Speaking  with clergy, the hospital chaplain, or other  religious advisors may help.    \nFatigue\nFatigue is one of the most common symptoms in the last days of life.\nFatigue (feeling very tired) is one of the most common symptoms in the last days of life. A patient's fatigue may become worse every day during this time. Drowsiness, weakness, and sleep problems may occur.          Drugs that increase brain activity, alertness, and energy may be helpful.      See the PDQ summary on Fatigue for more information.\nShortness of Breath\nFeeling short of breath is  common and may get worse during the final days or weeks of life.\nShortness of breath or not being able to catch your breath is often caused by advanced cancer. Other causes include the following:\nBuild-up of fluid in the abdomen.\nLoss of muscle strength.\nHypoxemia (a condition in which there is not enough oxygen in the blood).\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).\nPneumonia.\nInfection.\nThe use of opioids and other methods can help the patient breathe more easily.\nOpioids may relieve shortness of breath in patients. Other drugs, such as bronchodilators or steroids may be considered if in line with the patient’s goals of care. \nOther ways to help patients who feel short of breath include the following:     \nGive extra oxygen if    shortness of breath is caused by hypoxemia.\nAim a cool fan towards the patient’s face.\nHave the patient sit up.\nGive antibiotics if  shortness of breath is caused by an infection.\nPain\nPain medicines can be given in several ways.\nIn the last days of life, a patient may not be able to swallow pain medicine. When patients cannot take medicines by mouth, the pain medicine may be given by injection or infusion. These methods can be used at home with a doctor's order. \n\nPain during the final hours of life can usually be controlled. \nOpioid analgesics work very well to relieve  pain and are commonly used at the end of life. Some patients and family members worry that the use of opioids may cause death to occur sooner, but studies have shown no link between opioid use and early death. See the PDQ summary on Cancer Pain for  more information about opioids.\nCough\nCough at the end of life can be treated in several ways.\nCough at the end of life may add to a patient's discomfort. Repeated coughing can cause pain and loss of sleep, increase tiredness, and make shortness of breath worse. At the end of life, the decision may be to  treat the symptoms of the cough rather than to find and treat the cause. The following types of drugs may be used to make the patient as comfortable as possible:\nOver-the-counter cough medicines with expectorants to increase bronchial fluids and loosen mucus.\nMedicines to decrease mucus that can cause coughing in patients who have trouble swallowing.\nOpioids to stop the coughing. \nSee the PDQ summary on Cardiopulmonary Syndromes for more information.\nConstipation\nConstipation may occur  in the last days of life.\nPatients with cancer may have constipation in the last days of life. Patients  who have trouble swallowing may not be able to take laxatives by mouth. If needed, laxatives may be given rectally to treat constipation and make the patient comfortable. \nTrouble Swallowing\nPatients may have trouble swallowing food and fluids at the end of life.\nPatients with cancer may have trouble swallowing in the last days of life. Both fluids and food may be hard to swallow, causing a  loss of appetite, weight loss  and muscle wasting, and weakness. Small amounts of food that the patient enjoys may be given if they want to eat. Supplemental nutrition does not benefit patients in the last days of life and may increase the risk of aspiration and infections.\nWhen the patient cannot swallow, medicine may be given by placing it in the rectum, by injection or infusion, or by placing a patch on the skin.\nDeath Rattle\nRattle occurs when saliva or other fluids collect in the throat and upper airways.\nRattle occurs when saliva or other fluids build up in the throat and airways in a patient who is too weak to clear the throat. There are two types of rattle. Death rattle is caused by saliva pooling at the back of the throat. The other kind of rattle is caused by fluid in the airways from an infection, a tumor, aspiration, or extra fluid in body tissues.\nDrugs may be given to decrease the amount of saliva in the mouth or to dry the upper airway.\nNon-drug treatments for rattle include changing the patient's position and giving less   fluid.\nRaising the head of the bed, propping the patient up with pillows, or turning the patient to either side often relieves rattle. If the rattle is caused by fluid at the back of the throat, the fluid may be gently removed from the mouth using a suction tube.  \nDeath rattle is a sign that death may soon occur.\nDeath rattle is a sign that death may occur in hours or days. Rattle can be very upsetting for those at the bedside. It  does not seem to be painful for the patient and is not the same as shortness of breath.   \nMyoclonic Jerking\nMyoclonic jerks  may be caused by taking very high doses of opioids for a long time.\nMyoclonic jerks are sudden muscle twitches or jerks that cannot be controlled by the person having them. A hiccup is one type of myoclonic jerk.  Brief, shock-like jerks can occur in one or more different muscle groups anywhere in the body. Taking very high doses of an opioid for a long time may cause this side effect, but it can have other causes as well.   \nWhen opioids are the cause of myoclonic jerking, changing to another opioid may help. Different patients respond to opioids in different ways and certain opioids may be more likely than others to cause myoclonic jerking in some people.\nWhen the patient is very near death, medicine to stop the myoclonic jerking may be given instead of changing the opioid. When  myoclonic jerking is severe, drugs may be used to calm the patient down, relieve anxiety, and help the patient sleep.\nFever\nFever may be caused by infection, medicines, or the cancer itself.\nTreatment of fever in the last days of life depends on whether it causes the  patient distress or discomfort. Fever may be caused by  infection, medicines, or the cancer itself.  While  infections may be treated with antibiotics, patients near the end of life may choose not to treat the  cause of the fever.\n Hemorrhage\nSudden hemorrhage (heavy bleeding) may occur in patients who have certain cancers or disorders.\nHemorrhage (heavy bleeding in a short time) is rare but may occur in the last hours or minutes of life.  Blood vessels may be damaged by certain cancers or cancer treatments. Radiation therapy, for example, can  weaken blood vessels in the area that was treated. Tumors can also damage blood vessels. Patients with the following conditions have an increased risk of hemorrhage:\nAdvanced cancer, especially head and neck cancers.\nUlcers.\nMucositis caused by chemotherapy.\nBlood clotting disorders.\nThe patient and family should talk with the doctor about any concerns they have about the chance of hemorrhage.\nMaking the patient comfortable  is the main goal of care during hemorrhage at the end of life. \nIt is hard to know when hemorrhage might occur.   When sudden bleeding occurs at the end of life, patients usually become  unconscious and die soon afterwards. Resuscitation (restarting the heart) usually will not work.\nThe main goal of care is to help the patient be comfortable and to support family members. If hemorrhage occurs, it can be very upsetting for family members. It is helpful if the family talks about the feelings this causes and asks questions about it.\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n        Care Decisions in the Final Weeks, Days, and Hours of Life\n\n        Key Points\nDecisions about Chemotherapy\nDecisions about Immunotherapy\nDecisions about Hospice\nDecisions about Place of Death\nDecisions about Chemotherapy\nDecisions about whether to continue or stop chemotherapy are made by the patient and doctor together. About one-third of patients with advanced cancer continue to receive chemotherapy or other treatment near the end of life. \nTreatment with  chemotherapy  at this time  can result in the following:\nSerious side  effects.\nSpending more days  in the hospital.\nSpending last days in an intensive care unit. \nHowever, some patients with cancer choose to continue chemotherapy because they feel it helps them to live  in  the present and  focus on active treatment. Other patients choose palliative or comfort care to  treat pain and other symptoms. These decisions are based on   the patient's goals of care and the likely  risks and benefits of treatment. \nDecisions about Immunotherapy\nDecisions about whether to continue or stop immunotherapy are made by the patient and doctor together. Many patients taking these drugs are older or are no longer helped by chemotherapy, but may still have unwanted side effects.\nTreatment with immunotherapy at the end of life can result in the following:\nBeing less likely to use hospice services.\nSpending last days in the hospital.\nHaving  problems related to medical costs (financial toxicity).\nDecisions about Hospice\nHospice care is an important end-of-life option for patients with advanced cancer. Patients may feel that beginning hospice care means they have given up. Some patients fear   losing the relationship with their oncologist. However, many patients and caregivers feel they receive important benefits from hospice care.\nPatients who receive hospice care seem to have the following:\nBetter mental outlook.\nBetter relief of symptoms.\nBetter communication.\nLess stressful death (without causing death to happen sooner).\nHospice-related services include:\nVisiting nurse.\nChaplain.\nCounselor.\nHome health aide.\nRespite care.\nDoctors, patients, and caregivers should discuss hospice care and when it should begin.\nWhen hospice benefits are covered by Medicare, physicians are required to certify that  patients are not expected to live more than 6 months and that patients are not being treated to be cured. Other policies may be different, depending on the hospice and  the state.\nDecisions about Place of Death\nMany patients with advanced cancer wish to  die at home. Patients who die at home with hospice services and support seem to have better symptom control and quality of life. They also feel better prepared for death  than patients who die in a hospital or intensive care unit. Grieving caregivers have less trouble adjusting to their loss and feel they have honored the patient's wishes when their loved one dies at home.\nPatients who get hospice care are more likely to be able to die at home.  Hospice care can help control the patient's symptoms and give the caregiver the help  they need.\nHowever, not all patients choose to die at home. It is important for the patient, caregivers, and doctors to discuss where the patient wishes to die and the best way to fulfill   the patient's decision.\nFor children with advanced cancer, families and doctors should discuss wishes for the place of death early in the course of the disease. Children who die in the hospital may have more intense treatments and their parents may have more complicated grief than those of children who die at home.\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n        Decisions about Life-Sustaining Treatments in the Last Days of Life\n\n        Key Points\nIn the last days of life, patients and family members are faced with making decisions about treatments to keep the patient alive.\nChoices about care and treatment at the end of life should be made while the patient is able to make them.\nCare that supports a patient's spiritual health may improve quality of life.\nFluidsThe goals of giving fluids at the end of life should be discussed by patient, family, and doctors.\nNutrition SupportThe goals of nutrition support for patients in the last days of life are different from the goals during cancer treatment.\nMaking plans for  nutrition support in the last days is helpful.\nTwo types of nutrition support are commonly used.\nAntibioticsThe benefits of using antibiotics in the last days of life are  unclear.\nTransfusionsThe decision to use blood transfusions in advanced cancer depends on goals of care and other factors.\nResuscitationPatients should decide whether or not they want cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).\nIn the last days of life, patients and family members are faced with making decisions about treatments to keep the patient alive.\nDecisions about whether to use life-sustaining treatments that may extend life in the final weeks or days cause a great deal of confusion and  anxiety. Some of these treatments are ventilator use, parenteral nutrition, and dialysis. \nPatients may be guided by their oncologist, but have the right to make their own choices about     life-sustaining treatments.   The following are some of the questions to discuss:\nWhat are the patient’s goals of care?\nHow would the possible benefits of  life-sustaining treatments help reach the patient's goals of care, and how likely would this be? \nHow would  the possible harms of life-sustaining treatments affect the patient's goals of care? Is the possible benefit worth the possible harm?\nBesides possible benefits and harms of life-sustaining treatments, what else can affect the decision?\nAre there other resources, such as palliative care, a  chaplain, or a medical ethicist, that could help the patient or family decide about life-sustaining treatments?\nChoices about care and treatment at the end of life should be made while the patient is able to make them.\nA patient may wish to receive all possible treatments, only some treatments, or no treatment at all in the last days of life.         These decisions may be written down ahead of time in an advance directive, such as a living will. Advance directive is the general term for different types of legal documents that describe the treatment or care a patient wishes to receive or not receive when he or she is no longer able to speak their wishes.\nStudies have shown that cancer patients who have end-of-life discussions with their doctors choose to have fewer procedures, such as resuscitation or the use of a ventilator. They are also less likely to be in intensive care, and the cost of their healthcare is lower during their final week of life. Reports from their caregivers show that these patients live as long as patients who choose to have more procedures and that they have a better quality of life in their last days.\nSee the PDQ summary on Planning the Transition to End-of-Life Care in Advanced Cancer for more information.\nCare that supports a patient's spiritual health may improve quality of life.\nA spiritual assessment is a method or tool used by doctors to understand  the role that religious and spiritual beliefs have in the patient's life. This may help the doctor understand how these beliefs affect the way the patient copes with cancer  and makes decisions about cancer treatment.\nSerious illnesses like cancer may cause patients or family caregivers to have doubts about their beliefs or religious values and cause spiritual distress.  Some studies show that patients with cancer may feel anger at God or may have a loss of faith after being diagnosed. Other patients may have feelings of spiritual distress when coping with cancer.   Spiritual distress may affect end-of-life decisions and increase depression.\nDoctors and nurses, together with social workers and psychologists,  may be able to offer care that supports a patient's spiritual health. They may encourage patients to meet with their spiritual or religious leaders or join  a spiritual support group. This may improve patients' quality of life and ability to cope. When patients with advanced cancer receive spiritual support from the medical team, they are  more likely to choose hospice care and less aggressive treatment at the end of life.\nSee the PDQ summary on Spirituality in Cancer Care for more information.\nFluids\nThe goals of giving fluids at the end of life should be discussed by patient, family, and doctors.\nFluids may be given when the patient can no longer eat or drink  normally. Fluids may be given  with  an intravenous (IV) catheter or through a needle under the skin.\nDecisions about giving fluids should be based on the patient's goals of care. Giving fluids   has not been shown to help patients live longer or to improve quality of life. However, the harms are minor and the family may feel there are benefits if the patient is  less fatigued and more alert.\nThe family may also be able to give the patient sips of water or ice chips, or swab the mouth and lips to keep them moist.\nNutrition Support\nThe goals of nutrition support for patients in the last days of life are different from the goals during cancer treatment.\nNutrition support can improve health and boost healing during cancer treatment.  The goals of nutrition therapy for patients  during the last days of life are different from the goals for patients in active cancer treatment and recovery. In the final days of life, patients often lose the desire to eat or drink and may not want food or fluids that are offered to them. Also, procedures used to put in feeding tubes may be hard on a patient.\nMaking plans for  nutrition support in the last days is helpful.\nThe goal of end-of-life care is to prevent suffering and relieve symptoms. If nutrition support  causes the patient more discomfort than help, then nutrition support near the end of life may be stopped. The needs and best interests of each patient guide the decision to give nutrition support. When decisions and plans about nutrition support are made by the patient, doctors and family members can be sure they are doing what the patient wants.\nTwo types of nutrition support are commonly used.\nIf the patient cannot swallow, two types of nutrition support are commonly used:\nEnteral nutrition uses a tube inserted into the stomach or intestine.\nParenteral nutrition uses an intravenous (IV) catheter inserted into a vein. \nEach type of nutrition support has benefits and risks.  \n See the PDQ summary on Nutrition in Cancer Care for more information.\nAntibiotics\nThe benefits of using antibiotics in the last days of life are  unclear.\nThe use of  antibiotics and other treatments for infection is common in patients in the last days of life, but it is hard to tell how well they work. It is also hard to tell if there are any benefits of using antibiotics at the end of life.\nOverall, doctors want to make the patient comfortable in the last days of life rather than  give treatments that may not help them live longer.\nTransfusions\nThe decision to use blood transfusions in advanced cancer depends on goals of care and other factors.\nMany patients with advanced cancer have anemia. Patients with advanced blood cancers may have thrombocytopenia (a condition in which there is a lower-than-normal number of platelets in the blood). Deciding whether to  use blood transfusions for these conditions is based on the following:\nGoals of care.\nHow long the patient is expected to live.\nThe   benefits and risks of the transfusion.\nThe decision is hard to make since patients usually need to receive transfusions in a medical setting rather than at home.\nMany patients are used to receiving  blood transfusions during active treatment or  supportive care, and may want to  continue transfusions to feel better. However, studies have not shown that transfusions are safe and effective at the end of life.\nResuscitation\nPatients should decide whether or not they want cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).\nAn important decision for the patient to make is whether to have cardiopulmonary resuscitation    (CPR) (trying to restart the heart and breathing when it stops). It is best if patients   talk with  their family, doctors, and caregivers about their wishes for CPR as early as possible (for example, when being admitted to the hospital or when active cancer treatment is stopped). A do-not-resuscitate (DNR) order is written by a doctor to tell other health professionals not to perform CPR at the moment of death, so that the natural process of dying occurs. If the patient wishes, he or she can ask the doctor to write a DNR order. The patient can ask that the DNR order be changed or removed at any time.\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n        Last Days in the Hospital or Intensive Care Unit\n\n        Key Points\nChoices about whether to use intensive care should be discussed.\nVentilator use may keep the patient alive after normal breathing stops.Before a ventilator is turned off, family members will be given information about what to expect.\nChoices about whether to use intensive care should be discussed.\nNear the end of life, patients with advanced cancer may be admitted to a hospital or   intensive care unit (ICU) if they have not made other choices for their care. In the ICU, patients or family members have to make hard decisions about whether to start, continue, or stop aggressive treatments that may make the patient live longer, but do not improve the patient's quality of life. Families may be unsure of their feelings or have trouble deciding whether to limit or avoid  treatments.\nSometimes, treatments like dialysis or blood transfusions may be tried for a short time. However, at any time, patients or families may talk with doctors about  whether they want to continue with ICU care. They may  choose instead to change over  to  comfort care in the final days.\nVentilator use may keep the patient alive after normal breathing stops.\n A ventilator is a machine that helps patients breathe. Sometimes, using a ventilator will not improve the patient's condition, but will keep the patient alive longer. If the goal of care is to help the patient live longer, a ventilator may be used, according to  the patient's wishes. If ventilator support stops  helping the patient or is no longer what the patient wants, the patient, family, and healthcare team may decide to turn the ventilator off.\nBefore a ventilator is turned off, family members will be given information about what to expect.\nFamily members will be given information about how the patient may respond when the ventilator is removed and about pain relief or sedation to keep the patient comfortable. Family members will be given time to contact other  loved ones who wish to be there. Chaplains or social workers may be called to give help and support to the family.\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n        Suffering and Palliative Sedation at the End of Life\n\n        Key Points\nThe emotions of patients and caregivers are closely connected.\nPalliative sedation lowers the level of consciousness and relieves extreme pain and suffering.\nThe emotions of patients and caregivers are closely connected.\nPatients and caregivers share the distress of cancer,  with the caregiver's distress sometimes being greater than the patient's. Since caregiver suffering can affect the patient's well-being and the caregiver's adjustment to loss, early and constant support of the caregiver is very important. \nPalliative sedation lowers the level of consciousness and relieves extreme pain and suffering.\n Palliative sedation uses drugs called sedatives to relieve extreme suffering by making a patient calm and unaware.\nThe decision whether to sedate a patient at the end of life   is a hard one. Sedation may be  considered for a patient's comfort or for a physical condition such as uncontrolled pain. Palliative sedation may be given on and off, or until death. A patient's thoughts and feelings  about end-of-life sedation may depend greatly on his or her own culture and beliefs.\nSome patients who become anxious facing the end of life may want to be sedated. Some patients and their families may wish to have a level of sedation that allows them to communicate with each other. Other patients may wish to have no procedures, including sedation, just before death.\nStudies have not shown that palliative sedation shortens life when used in the last days.\nIt is important for the patient to tell family members and healthcare providers of his or her wishes about   sedation at the end of life. When patients make their wishes about sedation known ahead of time, doctors and family members can be sure they are doing what the patient would want. Families may need  support from the healthcare team and mental health counselors while palliative sedation is used.\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n        Grief and Loss\n\n        Grief is a normal reaction to the loss of a loved one. People who feel unable to cope with their loss may be helped by grief counseling or grief therapy with trained professionals. See the PDQ summary on Grief, Bereavement, and Coping With Loss for more information.\n",

The PDQ database contains summaries of the latest published information on cancer prevention, detection, genetics, treatment, supportive care, and complementary and alternative medicine. Most summaries come in two versions. The health professional versions have detailed information written in technical language. The patient versions are written in easy-to-understand, nontechnical language. Both versions have cancer information that is accurate and up to date and most versions are also available in Spanish.\nPDQ is a service of the NCI. The NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). NIH is the federal government’s center of biomedical research.  The PDQ summaries are based on an independent review of the medical literature. They are not policy statements of the NCI or the NIH.\nPurpose of This Summary\nThis PDQ cancer information summary has current information about patient care during the last days to last hours of life.  It is meant to inform and help patients, families, and caregivers. It does not give formal guidelines or recommendations for making decisions about health care.\nReviewers and Updates\nEditorial Boards write the PDQ cancer information summaries and keep them up to date. These Boards are made up of experts in cancer treatment and other specialties related to cancer. The summaries are reviewed regularly and changes are made when there is new information. The date on each summary (\"Updated\") is the date of the most recent change.\nThe information in this patient summary was taken from the health professional version, which is reviewed regularly and updated as needed, by the PDQ Supportive and Palliative Care Editorial Board.\nClinical Trial Information\nA clinical trial is a study to answer a scientific question, such as whether one treatment is better than another. Trials are based on past studies and what has been learned in the laboratory. Each trial answers certain scientific questions in order to find new and better ways to help cancer patients. During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works. If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become \"standard.\" Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.\nClinical trials can be found online at NCI's website.

Bereavement is the period of grief and mourning after a death of a loved one. Most people  will adjust to the loss over time. Others will have longer periods of bereavement and may benefit from treatment. \nThis summary explains how grief, mourning, and bereavement are different and describes the different types of grief, treatments for grief,  and important  issues for grieving children. \n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n        Grief, Mourning, and Bereavement\n\n        Key Points\nGrief is the emotional response to the loss of a loved one.\nMourning is the way we show grief in public.\nBereavement is the period of sadness after  a death of a loved one.\nGrief is the emotional response to the loss of a loved one.\nCommon grief reactions include: \n\n \nFeeling emotionally numb.\nBeing unable to believe the loss occurred.\nHaving anxiety from the distress of being separated from the loved one.\nMourning along with feeling depressed.\nA feeling of acceptance.\nMourning is the way we show grief in public.\nThe way people mourn is affected by beliefs, religious practices, and culture. Grief and mourning are closely related. \nBereavement is the period of sadness after  a death of a loved one.\nGrief and mourning occur during the period of bereavement. People who are grieving are described as bereaved.\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n        Types of Grief\n\n        Key Points\nThere are three types of grief: anticipatory, normal or common, and complicated. Anticipatory griefoccurs before death. \nAnticipatory grief does not affect everyone.\nNormal or common grief begins soon after a loss and symptoms go away over time.\nNormal grief is different from major depression.\nComplicated grief lasts longer than normal grief.\nThere are three types of grief: anticipatory, normal or common, and complicated. \nAnticipatory grief occurs before death. \nAnticipatory grief is grief that occurs leading up to a death. It may be felt by the person dying or person's family. When a patient experiences distress, pain, and medical complications, it can add to anticipatory grief. Anticipatory grief is different from grief that occurs after the death.\nAnticipatory grief does not affect everyone.\nResearch has shown that about one in four patients with incurable cancer feels anticipatory grief. Anticipatory grief is less likely to occur when the patient and family accept death. Talking with someone who is trained in grief and bereavement may help patients and their family come to terms with impending death. \nNormal or common grief begins soon after a loss and symptoms go away over time.\nNormal grief occurs in most people who have experienced a loss. During normal grief, the bereaved person accepts the loss and continues with daily activities even though it is hard to do. Common emotional reactions include:\nEmotional numbness, shock, disbelief, or denial. These often occur  right after the death, especially if the death was not expected.\nAnxiety over being separated from the loved one. The bereaved may wish to  bring the person back and become lost in  thoughts of the deceased. Images of death may occur often in the person’s thoughts.\nDistress that leads to crying; sighing; having dreams, illusions, and hallucinations of the deceased; and looking for places or things that were shared with the deceased.\nAnger.\n Periods of sadness, loss of sleep, loss of appetite, fatigue, guilt, and loss of interest in life. \nGrief bursts or pangs are short periods (20-30 minutes) of very intense distress. These bursts are caused by reminders of the deceased person, such as during holidays, the anniversary of the loved one’s death, or when giving away items that belonged to the person. At other times they seem to happen for no reason.\nIn normal grief, symptoms will occur less often and will feel less severe as time passes. Recovery time will vary with each person. For most bereaved people, symptoms lessen between 6 months and 2 years after the loss. Although many bereaved people have similar responses as they cope with their losses, there is no typical grief response.\nNormal grief is different from major depression.\nWhen a person grieves they can have symptoms that overlap with major depression, such as sleep problems, feelings of guilt, repeated thoughts, and lack of interest. Normal grief is different from major depression in the following ways:\nPainful feelings come and go instead of being constant.\nThere are feelings of emptiness rather than sadness or not feeling pleasure.\nPeople have good self-esteem and do not feel worthless or badly about themselves.\nIf there are thoughts of suicide, they are focused on the deceased person, such as a wish to join them in death, instead of thoughts about oneself.\nA bereaved person can be diagnosed with major depression if they have symptoms that occur outside of the normal grief process.\nComplicated grief lasts longer than normal grief.\nComplicated grief is when symptoms don't improve and last for a long period of time, cause extreme distress, affect multiple areas of their lives, and decrease the ability to take part in daily activities.\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n        Factors that Affect Grief\n\n        Key Points\nThere are factors that affect the response to grief.The personality, age, and gender of the bereaved may affect whether they are more likely to experience depression with their grief.\nCulture and religion play a part in grief and bereavement.\nCoping skills and mental health history affect the response to an expected or unexpected loss.\nSocial support for the bereaved.\nThere are factors that affect the response to grief.\nA person’s grief is affected by their:\nPersonality, age, and gender.\nCultural and religious background.\nCoping skills and mental health history.\nAmount of support they have.\nSocial and financial position.\nRelationship with the person who died. \nThe deceased's cancer experience and the way the disease progressed. \nThe personality, age, and gender of the bereaved may affect whether they are more likely to experience depression with their grief.\nStudies have found that people with certain personality traits are more likely to have long-lasting depression after a loss. These include people who are  dependent on a loved one (such as a spouse), and people who deal with distress by thinking about it all the time.\nIn general, younger bereaved people have more problems after a loss than older bereaved people do. They have more severe health problems, grief symptoms, and other mental and physical symptoms. Younger bereaved people, however, may recover more quickly than older bereaved people do, because they tend to have more resources and social support.\nMen have more problems than women do after a spouse’s death. Men tend to have worse depression and more health problems than women do after the loss. Some researchers think this may be because men tend to have less social support after a loss.\nCulture and religionplay a part in grief and bereavement.\nGrief occurs in all cultures. However, some cultures have different beliefs about death that affect the attitudes and practices of the bereaved. They use what will best meet their needs to deal with death.\nSome studies show that religion helps people cope better with grief, while other studies  show it does not help or causes more distress. Regular church attendance and social support from a religious setting are linked to positive grief outcomes, such as coping and understanding the loss.  \nCoping skills and mental health history affect the response to an expected or unexpected loss.\nIt may seem that any sudden, unexpected loss might lead to more difficult grief. However, studies have found that bereaved people with high self-esteem and/or a feeling that they have control over life are likely to have a normal grief reaction even after an unexpected loss. Bereaved people with low self-esteem and/or a sense that life cannot be controlled are more likely to have complicated grief after an unexpected loss. This includes more depression and physical problems. \nSocial supportfor the bereaved.\nLack of social support increases the chance of having problems  coping with a loss. Social support includes the person's family, friends, neighbors, and community members who can give psychological, physical, and financial help. After the death of a close family member, many people have  related losses. The death of a spouse, for example, may cause a loss of income and changes in lifestyle and day-to-day living. These are all related to social support.\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n        Treatment of Grief\n\n        Key Points\nNormal grief may not need to be treated.\nCognitive behavioral therapy may help people with complicated grief.\nDepression related to grief may be treated with drugs.\nNormal grief may not need to be treated.\nMost bereaved people work through grief and recover within the first 6 months to 2 years. Researchers are studying whether bereaved people who have normal grief would be helped by treatment. They are also studying whether treatment might prevent complicated grief  in people who are likely to have it. \nFor people who have serious grief reactions or symptoms of distress,  treatment may be helpful. \nCognitive behavioral therapy may help people with complicated grief.\nCognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)   helps a person learn skills that change negative thoughts and behaviors about grief. \nA clinical trial compared CBT to counseling for complicated grief. Results showed that patients treated with CBT had  more improvement in symptoms and general mental distress than those in  the counseling group.\nDepression related to grief may be treated with drugs.\nThere is no standard drug therapy for depression that occurs with  grief. The decision to treat grief-related depression with drugs is up to the patient and the health care professional. \nClinical trials of antidepressants for depression related to grief have found that the drugs can help relieve depression. However, they give less relief and take longer to work than they do when used for depression that is not related to grief. Some clinical trials have found that psychotherapy while on antidepressants can improve depression and reduce the intensity of grief.  \n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n        Children and Grief\n\n        Key Points\nChildren have a different grief experience than adults.\nSeveral factors can affect how a child will cope with grief.\nA child’s understanding of death and the events near death depend on their age and developmental stage.\nThere are three common worries children coping with a loss have about death.Did I make the death  happen?\nIs it going to happen to me?\nWho is going to take care of me?\nTalking honestly about the death and including the child in rituals may help the child cope with the loss.Explain the death and answer questions.\nUse the correct language.\nInclude the child in planning and attending memorial services.\nThere are books and other resources with information on helping a grieving child.\nChildren have a different grief experience than adults.\nChildren do not react to loss in the same ways as adults. These are some of the ways children's grief is different:\nChildren show grief once in a while and for  a short time span. A child who grieves may be sad one minute and playful the next. \nOften families think the child doesn’t understand the loss or has gotten over\nit quickly.  Usually, neither is true. Children’s minds protect them from what is too\nmuch for them to handle.\nThe bereavement process may\ncontinue as the child gets older. Children will revisit the loss repeatedly,  especially at important times, such as\ngoing to camp, graduating from school, getting married, or having children.\nGrieving children\nmay not show their feelings as openly as adults.  Grieving children may jump right\ninto activities  instead of withdrawing or showing grief.\nChildren cannot think through their thoughts and feelings like adults. Children may have trouble putting their feelings about grief into words. Strong feelings of anger and fears\nof death or being left alone may show up in the behavior of grieving children. \nChildren often play death games as a way of working out their feelings and\nworries.  These games give children a safe\nway to express their feelings.\nWhile grieving adults may withdraw and not talk to other people about the loss, children often talk to the people around them (even strangers) to see\n how they react and to get clues for how they should respond to the loss.  \nChildren may\nask confusing questions such as, \"I know grandpa died,\nbut when will he come home?\"  This is a way of testing reality and making sure\nthe story of the death has not changed.\nSeveral factors can affect how a child will cope with grief.\nAlthough grief is different for each child, several factors can affect the grief process of a child:\nThe child's age and stage\nof development.\nThe child's personality.\nThe child's previous experiences with death.\nThe child's relationship with the\ndeceased.\nThe child’s surroundings.\nThe cause of death.\nThe way the child acts and\ncommunicates within the family.\nHow stable the family life is after the loss.\nHow\nthe child continues to be cared for.\nWhether the child is given the chance to\nshare and express feelings and memories.\nHow the parents cope with stress.\nWhether the child has ongoing relationships with other adults.\nA child’s understanding of death and the events near death depend on their age and developmental stage.\n\nInfants do not recognize death, but feelings of loss and separation are part of their awareness of death. Children who have been separated from their mother may be sluggish and quiet, may not respond to a smile or a coo, may have physical symptoms (such as weight loss), and may sleep less.\n\nChildren at this age often confuse death with sleep and may feel anxiety as early as age 3. They may stop talking and appear to feel overall distress.\n\nAt this age children see death as a kind of sleep; the person is alive, but only in a limited way. The child cannot fully separate death from life. Children may think that the person is still living, even though he or she might have been buried. The child may ask questions about the deceased (for example, how does the deceased eat, go to the bathroom, breathe, or play?). Young children know that death is physical, but think it is  not final. \nA child may think death involves \"magical thinking.\" For example, the child may think that his or her thoughts can cause another person to become sick or die.\nGrieving children under 5 may have trouble eating, sleeping, and controlling their bladder and bowel.\n\nChildren at this age are often very curious about death and may ask what happens to the body when it dies. Death is thought of as a person or spirit separate from the person who was alive, such as a skeleton, ghost, angel, or bogeyman. They may see death as final and scary but as something that happens mostly to old people (and not to themselves). \nGrieving children can become afraid of school, have learning problems, show antisocial or aggressive behavior, or become overly worried about their own health and complain of  imaginary symptoms. Children this age may either withdraw from others or become too attached and clingy.\nBoys may become more aggressive and destructive (for example, acting out in school), instead of  showing their sadness openly. \nWhen one parent dies, children may feel abandoned by both the deceased parent and the living parent, whose grief  may make him or her unable to emotionally support the child. \n\nChildren aged 9 and older know that death cannot be avoided and do not see it as a punishment. By the time a child is 12 years old, death is seen as final and something that happens to everyone.\nThere are three common worries children coping with a loss have about death.\nDid I make the death  happen?\nChildren often think that they have \"magical powers.\" If a mother is irritated and says, \"You’ll be the death of me\" and later dies, her child may wonder if he or she caused the mother’s death. Also, when children argue, one may say (or think), \"I wish you were dead.\" If that child dies, the surviving child may think that those thoughts caused the death.\nIs it going to happen to me?\nThe death of another child may be very hard for a child. If the child thinks that the death may have been prevented (by either a parent or a doctor) the child may fear that he or she could also die.\nWho is going to take care of me?\nSince children depend on parents and other adults to take care of them, a grieving child may wonder who will care for him or her after the death of an important person.\nTalking honestly about the death and including the child in rituals may help the child cope with the loss.\nExplain the death and answer questions.\n\nTalking about death helps children learn to cope with loss. When talking about death with children, describe it simply. Each child should be told the truth with as much detail as he or she is able to understand. Answer questions in a way the child can understand. \n\nChildren often worry that they will also die, or that their surviving parent will go away. They need to be told that they will be safe and taken care of. \nUse the correct language.\n\nWhen talking with the child  about death, include the correct words, such as \"cancer,\" \"died,\" and \"death.\" Other phrases such as,  “he passed away,” “he is sleeping,” or “we lost him,” can confuse children. \n\nInclude the child in planning and attending memorial services.\n\nWhen a death occurs, children may feel better if they are included in planning and attending memorial services. These events help children remember the loved one. Children should be encouraged to take part when they feel comfortable doing so and not be forced. Before a child attends a funeral, wake, or memorial service, give the child a full explanation of what to expect. A familiar adult or family member may help with this if the surviving parent's grief  makes him or her unable to. \nThere are books and other resources with information on helping a grieving child.\nThe following books and videos may be helpful  with grieving children:\n Worden JW: .

The PDQ database contains summaries of the latest published information on cancer prevention, detection, genetics, treatment, supportive care, and complementary and alternative medicine. Most summaries come in two versions. The health professional versions have detailed information written in technical language. The patient versions are written in easy-to-understand, nontechnical language. Both versions have cancer information that is accurate and up to date and most versions are also available in Spanish.\nPDQ is a service of the NCI. The NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). NIH is the federal government’s center of biomedical research.  The PDQ summaries are based on an independent review of the medical literature. They are not policy statements of the NCI or the NIH.\nPurpose of This Summary\nThis PDQ cancer information summary has current information about how individuals cope with grief, bereavement, and mourning.  It is meant to inform and help patients, families, and caregivers. It does not give formal guidelines or recommendations for making decisions about health care.\nReviewers and Updates\nEditorial Boards write the PDQ cancer information summaries and keep them up to date. These Boards are made up of experts in cancer treatment and other specialties related to cancer. The summaries are reviewed regularly and changes are made when there is new information. The date on each summary (\"Updated\") is the date of the most recent change.\nThe information in this patient summary was taken from the health professional version, which is reviewed regularly and updated as needed, by the PDQ Supportive and Palliative Care Editorial Board.\nClinical Trial Information\nA clinical trial is a study to answer a scientific question, such as whether one treatment is better than another. Trials are based on past studies and what has been learned in the laboratory. Each trial answers certain scientific questions in order to find new and better ways to help cancer patients. During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works. If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become \"standard.\" Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.\nClinical trials can be found online at NCI's website.

Make sure you’re eating healthy, being active, and taking time for yourself.\n\n\nDealing with Feelings of Frustration and Guilt\n\n\nCaregiving, especially from a distance, is likely to bring out many different emotions, both positive and negative. Feeling frustrated and angry with everyone, from the care recipient to the doctors, is a common experience. Anger could be a sign that you are overwhelmed or that you are trying to do too much. If you can, give yourself a break: take a walk, talk with your friends, get some sleep—try to do something for yourself.\n\n\nAlthough they may not feel as physically exhausted and drained as the primary, hands-on caregiver, long-distance caregivers may still be worried and anxious. Sometimes, long-distance caregivers feel guilty about not being closer, not doing enough, not having enough time with the person, and perhaps even feeling jealous of those who do. Many long-distance caregivers also find that worrying about being able to afford to take time off from work, being away from family, or the cost of travel increases these frustrations. Remember that you are doing the best you can given the circumstances and that you can only do what you can do. It may help to know that these are feelings shared by many other long-distance caregivers—you are not alone in this.\n\n\nTaking Care of Yourself\nTaking care of yourself if one of the most important things you can do as a caregiver. Make sure you are making time for yourself, eating healthy foods, and being active. Consider joining a caregiver support group, either in your own community or online. Meeting other caregivers can relieve your sense of isolation and will give you a chance to exchange stories and ideas. If you need help, don’t be afraid to ask for it.\n\n\nCaregiving is not easy for anyone—not for the caregiver and not for the care recipient. There are sacrifices and adjustments for everyone. When you don’t live where the care is needed, it may be especially hard to feel that what you are doing is enough and that what you are doing is important. It often is.\n\n\nLearn about sharing caregiving responsibilities with friends and family.\n\n\nFor More Information About Caregiver Health\n\n    \n      \n800-445-8106info@caregiver.orgwww.caregiver.org\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThis content is provided by the NIH National Institute on Aging (NIA).

        "text": "A Guide to Taking Care of Yourself\n By Family Caregiver Alliance\n “The care you give to yourself is the care you give to your loved one,” said a caregiver. Absolutely the easiest thing for someone to say and the hardest thing to accept is the advice to take care of yourself as a caregiver. It is often hard to see beyond the care tasks that await you each morning.\nWhat is shown by study after study is that caregiving compromises health. About 60% of caregivers show signs of clinical depression, and caregivers take more prescription medications, including those for anxiety and depression, than others in their age group. Reluctance in asking for and accepting help is a major barrier to getting necessary respite and support. Who has time to think about breaks when there is a diaper that needs to be changed? Seventy-five percent of caregivers in America are women, some taking care of spouses/partners, some adult children taking care of parents, some parents taking care of adult children. What does taking care of yourself mean, why is it so hard to do, and how do you do it?\nSupport\nSupport and coping comes in many forms—prayer, talking to family, friends or professionals, saying “yes” to offers of help, taking walks, reading a book, eating hot fudge sundaes. But most caregivers end up withdrawing from friends and family and feeling isolated and as if no one understands. Support groups can be an important source of understanding and connection.\nGuilt\nGuilt that “I should” do this or be able to do it, guilt that your loved one wonʼt get as good care if you aren’t doing it, guilt that something will happen if you are away, guilt about having a good time when someone else is not. As there is no “perfect parent,” there is no such thing as a “perfect” caregiver. And you are not selfish to sometimes think about yourself and your needs and feelings. Although caregivers feel guilty when they get angry or frustrated, these feelings are OK and a way to know how well you are coping. “How can I say it is difficult when I really love this person?” questioned the husband of a client.\nSetting Limits\nLearn to ask for help. The often-heard question, “Is there anything you need?” has but one answer: Yes. “Yes, I need a meal, I need someone to stay here so I can go out, I need some time by myself, I need flowers, I need help in the garden, I need some groceries.” Learn to say “no” to requests that are draining rather than nurturing, such as hosting holiday meals. You can still make choices about your life and what is right for you and you do still have some control.\nYour Body\nNot getting enough sleep is a major cause of illness and stress in caregivers. Exhaustion is one of the main complaints, leading to irritability and then inappropriate anger which then leads to more guilt. Talk with your physician about medication for either yourself or your loved one to help with sleeping through the night. Know the limits of your own endurance and strength. Make sure you have regular check ups and that those “little concerns” about your health are looked into. Exercise is even more important as it gives you a break, combats depression, and helps you maintain health. When I talk with caregivers, one of their fears is worrying about what will happen to their loved one if something happens to them. Worrying doesnʼt help. Taking better care of your health does.\nEducation\nLearn as much as you can about the illness so that you can understand what is happening. Attend a workshop or support group, not just for emotional support but also to learn caregiving tricks to make caregiving easier. You can’t know it all; this is a job you werenʼt trained to do. Contact someone who can help you connect with community resources and use them.\nEmotional Health and Respite\nTaking care of yourself may mean dealing with family problems. How can you make your siblings pull their weight? Possibly you canʼt, and learning how to have a family meeting or work around them is essential for survival. One family actually has a chart and marks off what each does so no one can say, “You aren’t doing your share.” It is easy to become overwhelmed, thus the need for breaks. One caregiver told me that she deals so much better with her husband when he has been at day care, because when he comes home, she is not already frustrated by him. Without breaks, you begin to question yourself, feel inadequate, and experience burn out. Caregivers are often mourning the loss of the person “who used to be.” Grief and loss need to be acknowledged.\nOne of the stressors of caregiving is seeing no end to the situation. Having a life and connections outside of caregiving helps you to maintain perspective, so that caregiving doesn’t become oneʼs only reality.

        "text": "Depression and Caregiving\n By Family Caregiver Alliance and reviewed by Beth MacLeod, Licensed Clinical Social Worker (LCSW)\n Introduction\nMany people with symptoms of depression don’t describe themselves as feeling depressed. Some people don’t recognize the symptoms in themselves, while others may have a hard time admitting they feel depressed. It can be embarrassing to talk about. An individual may feel like a failure or that people will judge them. But here’s what you need to know: for caregivers, depression is more common than you might think, and it’s a normal response to a difficult situation. It is not unusual for caregivers to develop mild or more serious depression as a result of the constant demands they face while providing care.\nDepression is an extremely complex condition with many research studies underway to pinpoint the cause(es). Known contributing factors include genetic characteristics, hormone levels, environmental triggers, certain medications, the effects of living with a major illness, grief and loss due to the the death of a loved one, having experienced physical or emotional abuse, living with someone with serious depression, and other factors. Not everyone will experience the negative feelings that go with depression. But we know that in an effort to provide the best possible care for a family member or friend, caregivers often sacrifice their own physical and emotional needs. The complex and varied aspects involved with providing care can strain even the most capable person. Feelings of overwhelm, agitation, anxiety, distress, pessimism, isolation, exhaustion—and sometimes guilt for having these feelings—can exact a heavy toll.\nEveryone has negative thoughts or feelings that come and go over time, but when these feelings become more intense and leave you drained of energy, tearful or irritable towards a loved one, it may well be a warning sign of depression. Concerns about depression arise when the emptiness and crying don’t go away, or when those negative feelings are unrelenting.\nUnfortunately, feelings of depression are often seen as a sign of weakness rather than a sign that something is out of balance. Comments from others such as “snap out of it” or “it’s all in your head” are not helpful, and reflect a belief that mental health concerns are not real. Ignoring or denying your feelings will not make them go away.\nEarly attention to symptoms of depression through exercise, a healthy diet, positive support of family and friends, or consultation with a trained health or mental health professional may help to prevent the development of a more serious depression over time.\nSymptoms of Depression\nPeople experience depression in different ways. Some may feel classic symptoms, like sadness and hopelessness. Others may have signs that you might not equate with depression, such as extreme fatigue or irritability. The type and degree of symptoms vary by individual and can change over time. Consider these common symptoms of depression. Have you experienced any of the following for longer than two weeks?\nFeeling sad, tearful, empty, hopeless\nChanges in eating habits—weight loss and no appetite or cravings with weight gain\nChanges in sleep—too much sleep or not enough\nFeeling tired all the time, difficulty being motivated to do anything\nA loss of interest in people and/or activities that once brought you pleasure\nFeeling numb\nBecoming easily agitated or angered\nFeeling that nothing you do is good enough\nIncrease in alcohol or drug consumption\nExcessive time on the Internet\nTrouble focusing, thinking, or planning—as if your head was filled with fog\nNeglecting your physical well-being and appearance\nThoughts of running away, or escaping from the situation\nThoughts of death or suicide, ideas of how to end your life\nOngoing physical symptoms that do not respond to treatment, such as headaches, digestive disorders, and chronic neck and back pain\nSpecial Caregiver Concerns\n Researchers have found that a person who provides care for someone with dementia is twice as likely to suffer from depression as a person providing care for someone without dementia. Not only do caregivers spend significantly more hours per week providing care, they report more employment problems, personal stress, mental and physical health problems, lack of sleep, less time to do the things they enjoy, less time to spend with other family members, and more family conflict than non-dementia caregivers.  As stressful as the deterioration of a loved one’s mental and physical abilities may be for the caregiver, dealing with dementia-related behavior is an even bigger contributor to developing depression. Dementia-related symptoms such as wandering, agitation, hoarding, embarrassing conduct. and resistance or non-cooperation from the loved one makes every day challenging and makes it harder for a caregiver to get rest or assistance in providing care. The more severe the case of dementia, the more likely the caregiver is to experience depression. It is critical for caregivers, especially in these situations, to receive consistent and dependable support and respite.\n Women, primarily wives and daughters, provide the majority of caregiving. In the United States, approximately 12 million women experience clinical depression each year, at approximately twice the rate of men. If you think depression is all in your head, think again. Physical factors like menopause, childbirth, PMS, thyroid disease, and nutritional deficiencies in iron, vitamin D, and Omega-3 fatty acids can all cause depression.  A Mental Health America study found that many women do not seek treatment for depression because they are embarrassed or in denial about being depressed. In fact, 41% of women surveyed cited embarrassment or shame as barriers to treatment. Keep in mind that doctors have heard it all. It is important to both your mental and physical health to get a complete physical exam. Take time during the exam to bring up the subject of depression if you suspect you are experiencing symptoms of depression.\n Men are less likely to admit to depression and doctors are less likely to diagnose depression in men. Men will more often “self-treat” their depressive symptoms of anger, irritability, or feelings of powerlessness with alcohol or overwork. Although male caregivers tend to be more willing than female caregivers to hire outside help for assistance with home care duties, they tend to have fewer friends to confide in or positive activities to engage in outside the home. The mistaken assumption that depressive symptoms are a sign of weakness can make it especially difficult for men to seek help.  \n Military and veteran caregivers experience depression nearly twice the rate of non-military caregivers. The more severe the mental and/or physical health conditions of the veteran, the more demands you face as a caregiver. Conditions like dementia, traumatic brain injury, and post-traumatic stress disorder (TBI and PTSD) can be particularly challenging for caregivers. Trying to cope with daily life in addition to watching out for the veteran’s triggers, or helping them cope with their own stress, can lead you to feel overwhelmed and increase feelings of depression, particularly feelings of helplessness and hopelessness. As a military caregiver, you may not have other people in your life who understand the experience of caring for a service member, particularly younger caregivers whose peers are unlikely to be facing the same kinds of challenges. You may have even moved to have better access to VA benefits, or to a region that is more supportive to your veteran’s needs, which can make you feel even more isolated and less likely to have help from people you know and trust. That doesn’t mean help isn’t available. The first step is to talk to your doctor who can refer you to a mental health professional and can prescribe medications as appropriate.  \n While sleep needs vary, most people need eight hours a day. Loss of sleep as a result of caring for a loved one can lead to serious depression. The important thing to remember is that even though you may not be able to get your loved one to rest throughout the night, you can arrange to get much needed sleep. Hiring a respite worker or engaging a friend to be with your loved one while you take a nap, finding a day care center, or scheduling a stay over with another family member for a few nights, are a few ways to keep your caregiving commitment while getting the sleep you need.  \n Making the decision to move a loved one to a care center is very stressful. While many caregivers are finally able to catch up on much needed rest, the loneliness, guilt, and monitoring the care a loved one receives in this new location can add new stress. Many caregivers feel depressed at the time of placement and some continue to feel depressed for some time after.\nPeople assume that once caregiving is over, the stress from providing hands-on care will go away. Yet, researchers found that even three years after the death of a spouse with dementia, some former caregivers continued to experience depression and loneliness. In an effort to return their life to normal, former caregivers may need to seek help for depression as well.\nWhat to Do if You Think You Have Depression\nDepression deserves to be treated with the same attention afforded any other illness, such as diabetes or high blood pressure. Likewise, the best way to figure out what is causing symptoms is to talk to a qualified professional, like your doctor. If you feel uncomfortable using the term depression, tell your doctor that you are “feeling blue” or “feeling down,” and describe your personal experience and symptoms. The more specific you can be, the better your doctor can help you. The important thing is to make it a priority during your appointment and be as honest as possible so your doctor can help you.\nIt’s not uncommon for a person receiving care to suffer from undiagnosed depression. Everything can feel worse than it is from their perspective adding to any daily caregiving challenges you may be experiencing. If you suspect this is the case in your caregiving situation, look for an opportunity to share your concern with them. If they are reluctant to talk about it with you, encourage a trusted friend to talk with them or consider leaving a message for their doctor regarding your concern prior to their next appointment.   \nHow Is Depression Treated?\nThe first step to getting the best treatment for depression is to meet with a mental health professional such as a psychologist, social worker, or other licensed therapist. At the same time, schedule a physical exam with your doctor. Certain medications, as well as some medical conditions such as viral infection, can cause the same symptoms as depression, and should be evaluated by a physician. The exam should include lab tests and an interview that tests for mental status to determine if speech, memory, or thought patterns have been affected.\nAlthough a physician may prescribe antidepressant medication, medication alone is not the most effective treatment for depression. Concurrent guidance of a mental health professional is strongly recommended. The therapist or counselor will listen to your concerns, screen you for symptoms of depression, and assist you in developing ways to address your stress and build new coping patterns.\nOne way to find a professional is to ask a friend for the name of someone they know and trust. You may also find someone by asking your minister or rabbi, your doctor, or if you are employed, you may check your employer’s health insurance provider list or Employee Assistance Program (EAP). In addition, national organizations can provide contact information for mental health professionals in your community. (See “Finding a Professional in Your Area” in this fact sheet.)\nIt is important to trust and feel comfortable with the professional you see. It is not uncommon to request a free introductory phone or in-person meeting to help determine if the professional is the right match for your particular needs and style. It is appropriate to clarify:\nWhat the cost will be\nHow much your insurance will pay\nHow many scheduled sessions you should expect to have with the mental health therapist\n Any treatment should be evaluated regularly to ensure that it continues to contribute towards your improved health and growth.\nTreatment Options\nUpon review of a physical and mental health evaluation, a course of treatment may be recommended. Primary treatment options are psychotherapy (also referred to as mental health therapy and talk therapy) and antidepressant medication. These treatments may be used alone or in combination with one another. The most frequent treatment for depressive symptoms that have progressed beyond the mild stage is antidepressant medication, which provides relatively quick symptom relief. Critical to treatment for depression is the concurrent use of psychotherapy along with medication. Discussing your situation with a therapist can open up new self-awareness for addressing a particular emotional concern and provide guidance to address challenges in getting and staying healthy.\nWhen choosing a therapist, be sure to ask about their experience working with family caregivers and their understanding of caregiving-related stressors.\nIf drug therapy is recommended, a certain amount of trial and error is necessary to find the right type and dosage of medication for each individual, and it may take several weeks before effects are felt. Good communication between patient and doctor is important. Older adults should be especially careful to watch for medication side effects caused from too high a dosage or interactions with other medications.\nComplementary and Alternative Therapies\nMany complementary medicines and alternative therapies are promoted for coping with depression. Some have been tested in scientific clinical trials, but many have not. Here is an overview of some of the most common therapies:\n Exercise has been found to reduce the effects of depression. Walking three times a week for 30 to 45 minutes has been linked to reducing or alleviating symptoms of depression. If that seems like a lot of time you don’t have, then start with 15 minutes once a week. The important message is to get started with a regular exercise activity.\nIt is unknown whether physical activity prevents the onset of depression or just helps modify the effects. Arranging time for exercise is sometimes difficult for caregivers. It is often seen as a “value added” activity—something to do when everything else is done. You might consider adding it to your “to do” list, asking a friend to give you a “walk date” each week as a gift, or requesting that your doctor write a prescription for walking or joining an exercise class. All the research shows that for a healthier life, it makes good sense to make time for exercise.\n There is a growing body of research showing that our thoughts, beliefs, and feelings can have a direct impact on our health, and our physical health can impact our mental state. Your mind and body are interrelated. Implementing mind-body techniques into your routine may help alleviate depression.\nEven 5 to 10 minutes of any of these techniques may be beneficial. These are some to try:\nMeditation\nPrayer\nDeep breathing\nAcupuncture\nYoga\nMassage\nListening to music\nCreating art\nGuided imagery\nJournaling\n Herbal “over-the-counter” treatments such as St. John’s Wart (Hypericum perforatum) and other supplements such as SAMe and omega-3 fatty acids are under study and/or in popular use in the US and Europe for treating depressive symptoms. At present, for nonprescription drugs in the US, there are no established criteria for determining the amount of active ingredient a company puts in their product or what dose is right for a given person. Effectiveness of a product is difficult to determine, and the effects of a product can have negative side effects. For example, the US Food and Drug Administration issued a warning stating that St. John’s wort may affect the metabolic pathway used by many prescription drugs prescribed to treat a number of conditions, including heart disease, depression, and HIV infections.\n Caregivers who feel “the blues” when confined indoors or in response to winter’s gray days may suffer from Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD), also referred to as “winter depression.” As seasons change, there is a shift in our biological internal clocks or circadian rhythms, partly in response to the changes in sunlight patterns. This can cause our biological clocks to be out of sync with our daily schedules. People with SAD have a difficult time adjusting to the shortage of sunlight in the winter months. SAD symptoms are most pronounced in January and February, when the days are shortest. SAD is often misdiagnosed as hypothyroidism, hypoglycemia, infectious mononucleosis, and other viral infections.\nLight therapy, using specially designed bright fluorescent lights, has been shown to reverse SAD’s depressive symptoms. Experts believe that the light therapy works by altering the levels of certain brain chemicals, specifically melatonin. Antidepressant medication along with other treatments, including exercise, may be helpful as well. If you experience mild depressive symptoms seasonally, experiment with increasing the light in your surroundings, using lamps or other sources. If the symptoms are strong enough to impair your day-to-day functioning, seek out a mental health professional with expertise in treating SAD.\nPaying for Treatment\nPrivate health insurance and Medicare may pay for some mental health care, and the Affordable Care Act (ACA) has increased insurance coverage for mental health benefits. Policies vary widely, so it’s best to call the mental health professional directly to find out if they accept your insurance for payment. Health insurance providers will usually list mental health professionals in the same insurance material that lists health plan medical doctors. Medicare recipients will find the booklet titled, “Medicare and Your Mental Health Benefits” a helpful source of information. See the Resources section of this fact sheet to find out how to obtain a copy.\nThe “covered services” of the insurance plan will specify mental health coverage for inpatient (hospital, treatment center) and outpatient (professional’s office) care, how many visits are paid for, and at what rate of reimbursement. Employed caregivers may also have access to an Employee Assistance Program, where licensed professionals (usually psychologists and social workers) are available for confidential sessions to discuss personal or professional problems.\nProfessionals who don’t accept insurance are called “out-of-network providers,” and they may be able to provide you with a receipt that you can submit to your insurance for partial reimbursement. Check with the professional to see if this is an option. If so, you’ll have to contact your insurance company to make sure they’ll cover some of the cost. They may require you to meet a deductible before they will start paying.\nCaregivers without health insurance or who pay out-of-pocket for care will find that fees vary by professional and region, with psychiatrists and psychologists charging at the higher end of the fee scale, and therapists and social workers offering services at a more moderate rate. Some professionals offer a sliding scale fee, meaning they may slide their fee down to meet your need. There may also be low-fee clinics that have a set low fee or will apply a fee based on your ability to pay. In these settings, you are often meeting with a mental health intern who is being supervised by a licensed mental health provider. In any case, find out what the fee is up front to avoid any misunderstandings later on.\nStrategies to Help Yourself\nDepressive disorders can make one feel exhausted, helpless, and hopeless. Such negative thoughts and feelings make some people feel like giving up. It is important to realize that these negative views are part of the depression and may not accurately reflect the situation. Below are guidelines adapted from the National Institute of Mental Health offering recommendations for dealing with depression. Set realistic goals in light of the depression. You may not be able to accomplish as much as you are accustomed to when you are feeling well.\nBreak large tasks into small ones, set some priorities, and do what you can as you can.\nTry to be with other people and to confide in someone you know and trust; it is often better than suffering alone.\nParticipate in activities that may make you feel better, such as exercise, going to a movie or ballgame, or attending a religious, social, or community event.\nExpect your mood to improve gradually, not immediately. Feeling better takes time.\nIt is advisable to postpone important decisions until the depression has lifted. Before deciding to make a significant transition—change jobs, get married or divorced—discuss it with others who know you well and can offer another view of your situation.\nPeople rarely “snap out of” a depression. People who expect you to do this are misguided in their understanding of your condition.\nRemember, positive thinking and the practice of new coping patterns will replace the negative thinking that is part of the depression. The negative thinking will be reduced as your depression responds to treatment.\nSay “yes” to offers of help and engagement by family and friends who you know and trust.\nDirect assistance in providing care for your loved one, such as respite care relief, as well as positive feedback from others, positive self-talk, and recreational activities are linked to lower levels of depression. Look for classes and support groups available through caregiver support organizations to help you learn or practice effective problem-solving and coping strategies needed for caregiving. For your health and the health of those around you, take some time to care for yourself.\nResources\n (415) 434-3388 | (800) 445-8106 Website: www.caregiver.org E-mail: info@caregiver.orgFCA CareNav: https://fca.cacrc.org/loginServices by State: https://www.caregiver.org/connecting-caregivers/services-by-state/\nFamily Caregiver Alliance (FCA) seeks to improve the quality of life for caregivers through education, services, research, and advocacy. Through its National Center on Caregiving, FCA offers information on current social, public policy, and caregiving issues and provides assistance in the development of public and private programs for caregivers. For residents of the greater San Francisco Bay Area, FCA provides direct support services for caregivers of those with Alzheimer’s disease, stroke, traumatic brain injury, Parkinson’s, and other debilitating health conditions that strike adults.\n \nFinding a Professional in Your Area\n A psychiatrist is a medical doctor who specializes in the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of mental illnesses, including substance abuse and addiction.\n\n\twww.psych.org\n\tProvides free information on depression and referrals to psychiatrists in your area.\n Licensed to practice psychotherapy and has special training in psychological testing.

Here are some signs and symptoms that could mean professional help for depression is needed:\n \n  \n  \n   \n   Ongoing sad, hopeless, or “empty” mood almost every day for most of the day\n \n   Loss of interest or pleasure in activities that were once enjoyed\n \n   Major weight loss (when not dieting) or weight gain\n \n   Sleep changes (can’t sleep, early waking, or oversleeping)\n \n   Extreme tiredness or less energy almost every day\n \n   Other people notice that you’re restless or “slowed down” almost every day\n \n   Feelings of guilt, worthlessness, and helplessness\n \n   Trouble focusing, remembering, or making decisions\n \n   Frequent thoughts of death or suicide, or attempts at suicide\n \n   Wide mood swings from depression to periods of agitation and high energy\n \n  \n \n  Some physical problems such as tiredness, poor appetite, and sleep changes can also be side effects of cancer treatment, and can linger after cancer treatment is over. Ask your cancer team about the possible causes of these symptoms and if depression might be a factor.\n \n  Managing depression\n \n  Managing depression in people with cancer might include counseling, medication, or a combination of both, and sometimes other specialized treatments. These treatments improve the depression, reduce the suffering, and help the person with cancer have a better quality of life.\n \n  What the patient can do\n \n   \n   Talk about feelings and fears that you or family members have. It’s OK to feel sad, angry, and frustrated, but don’t take it out on those close to you. It's important to listen carefully to each other, decide together what you can do to support each other, and encourage, but do not force, one another to talk.\n \n   Seek help through support groups and counseling.\n \n   Use mindfulness, prayer, meditation, or other types of spiritual support.\n \n   Try deep breathing and relaxation exercises several times a day. (For example, close your eyes, breathe deeply, focus on each body part and relax it, starting with your toes and working up to your head. When you’re relaxed, imagine yourself in a pleasant place, such as a breezy beach or a sunny meadow.)\n \n   Consider working with a professional counselor to deal with the changes in your life.\n \n   Ask about treatments for depression.\n \n  \n        \n  What caregivers can do\n \n   \n   Gently invite the patient to talk about their fears and concerns. Do not force the patient to talk before they are ready.\n \n   Listen carefully without judging the patient’s feelings or your own. It’s OK to point out and disagree with self-defeating thoughts.\n \n   Avoid telling the person to “cheer up” or “think positively.”\n \n   Decide together what you can do to support each other.\n \n   Don’t try to reason with the person if fear, anxiety, or depression is severe. Get help from someone on the cancer care team.\n \n  \n  \n   \n   Engage the person in activities they enjoy.\n \n  \n   \n   \n   Keep in mind that caregivers can also become depressed. All these suggestions may be used for caregivers, too.\n \n   Take time to care for yourself. Spend time with friends or doing things you enjoy.\n \n   Consider getting support for yourself through groups or one-on-one counseling.\n \n  \n \n  Call the mental health provider or the cancer care team if the patient\n \n   \n   Has thoughts of suicide, or can’t stop thinking about death\n \n   Behaves in such a way that you’re concerned about their safety\n \n   Can’t eat or sleep and isn’t interested in their usual activities for several days\n \n   Has trouble breathing, is sweating, or feels very restless\n"

        "text": "If You’re About to Become a Cancer Caregiver\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n \n \n  \nCaregiver is defined here as the person who most often helps the person with cancer and is not paid to do so. In most cases, the main (primary) caregiver is a spouse, partner, parent, or an adult child. When family is not around, close friends, co-workers, or neighbors may fill this role. The caregiver has a key role in the patient’s care. Good, reliable caregiver support is crucial to the physical and emotional well-being of people with cancer.\n \n  Today, most cancer treatment is given in outpatient treatment centers – not in hospitals. This means someone is needed to be part of the day-to-day care of the person with cancer and that sicker people are being cared for at home. As a result, caregivers have many roles. These roles change as the patient’s needs change during and after cancer treatment.\n \n  Caregivers serve as home health aides and companions. They may help feed, dress, and bathe the patient. Caregivers arrange schedules, manage insurance issues, and provide transportation. They are legal assistants, financial managers, and housekeepers. They often have to take over the duties of the person with cancer, and still meet the needs of other family members.\n \n  On top of the normal day-to-day tasks, such as meals, cleaning, and driving or arranging transportation, as a caregiver, you’ll also become an important part of the cancer care team. This busy schedule could leave you with no time to take care of your own needs. You also may feel the need to turn down job opportunities, work fewer hours, or even retire early to meet the demands of being a caregiver.\n \n  Here are some things to think about if you are about to become a caregiver for a person with cancer.\n \n  What does it feel like to be a caregiver?\n \n  Despite the sadness and shock of having a loved one with cancer, many people find personal satisfaction in caring for that person. You may see it as a meaningful role that allows you to show your love and respect for the person. It may also feel good to be helpful and know that you’re needed by a loved one.\n \n  You might find that caregiving enriches your life. You might feel a deep sense of satisfaction, confidence, and accomplishment in caring for someone. You may also learn about inner strengths and abilities that you didn’t even know you had, and find a greater sense of purpose for your own life.\n \n  The caregiving role can open up doors to new friends and relationships, too. Through a support group, you can get to know people who have faced the same kinds of problems. Caregiving can also draw families together and help people feel closer to the person who needs care.\n \n  Caregiving can also be frustrating and painful. People caring for very sick patients may notice their own feelings of severe sadness and emotional distress. They may feel sadness and grief over their loved one’s illness and may also feel overwhelmed or frustrated as they try to manage many difficult problems.\n \n  Caregivers can develop physical symptoms, like tiredness and trouble sleeping. This is more likely to be a problem for caregivers who aren’t able to get the support they need, and who don’t take care of themselves – especially those who try to press forward alone, even as their own quality of life suffers.\n \n  Caring for someone going through cancer treatment can be demanding, but being good at it can give you a sense of meaning and pride. These good feelings can help provide the strength and endurance to continue in the role for as long as needed.\n \n  What if you don't want to be the caregiver?\n \n  It’s quite normal to feel overwhelmed, burdened, and even trapped at times while caregiving. If your family has had troubled relationships in the past, you may wonder “why me?” You may feel that the caregiver role was dumped on you without your consent. You may feel unprepared or even unable to manage the responsibilities and feelings that go with it. You may feel pressure from family members, friends, and members of the cancer care team to provide care, despite having little or no desire or ability to do so.\n \n  If you became a caregiver because of other people’s wishes, you need to think about how you feel about being pressured into caregiving. Mixed feelings at the onset of this role can lead to a greater sense of frustration later on. You should  – before the demands of caregiving become a problem. It’s not easy to do this when others resist the change, and it can take a lot of courage to do it. If you know you’re going to meet with resistance, talk with the patient’s team social worker first. Or you can ask their doctor about a referral so you can talk with someone about the caregiver problem.\n \n  Addressing the problems early can help you and the patient get the help you need, and if you have to, make other plans for care. In situations like this, it might be helpful to find someone to help you with caregiving so that you know from the start that the role will be shared. It also may be better to find someone else to act as the primary (main) caregiver.\n \n  You’ll need to take care of yourself, too\n \n  It’s hard to plan for a major health problem like cancer. Suddenly you’ve been asked to care for the person with cancer, and you’re also needed to help make decisions about medical care and treatment. None of this is easy. There will be times when you know you’ve done well, and times when you just want to give up. This is normal.\n \n  There are many causes of stress and distress in cancer caregivers. Dealing with the crisis of cancer in someone you love, the uncertain future, financial worries, difficult decisions, and unexpected and unwanted lifestyle changes are just a few of them. Fear, hopelessness, guilt, confusion, doubt, anger, and helplessness can take a toll on both the person with cancer and the caregiver. And while the focus tends to be on the patient, all of this will affect your physical and mental health, too.\n \n  Depression\n \n  Depression is common in caregivers. But caregiving does not always cause depression and not all caregivers have the difficult emotions that go with depression. Everyone has emotional ups and downs, but if a person always feels down, has no energy, cries a lot, or is easily angered, it may be a warning sign of depression.\n \n  Many people see the feelings of depression as a sign of weakness rather than a sign that something is out of balance, but ignoring or denying these feelings won’t make them go away. Early attention to symptoms of depression can make a big difference in how the caregiver feels about their role and how well they can do the things they need to do.\n \n  There are ways to help reduce stress and remind you to enjoy life. They might help prevent a more serious depression that can develop over time:\n \n   \n   Support from family and friends in caring for the patient\n \n   Exercise\n \n   A healthy diet\n \n   Spiritual support, such as religious activity, prayer, journaling, or meditation\n \n   Recreational time, when you can enjoy friends socially\n \n   Help from a trained mental health professional\n \n  \n \n  But caregivers often focus on the person with cancer and don’t take care of themselves. You may be a caregiver, but you still have your own needs that cannot and should not be put aside.\n \n  Plan things that you enjoy\n \n  There are 3 types of activities that you need to do for yourself:\n \n   \n   Those that involve other people, such as having lunch with a friend.\n \n   Those that give you a sense of accomplishment, like exercising or finishing a project.\n \n   Those that make you feel good or relaxed, like watching a funny movie or taking a walk.\n \n  \n \n  Make an effort to notice and talk about things you do as they happen during the day. Watch the news or take time to read the morning paper. Set aside time during the day, like during a meal, when you do not talk about illness.\n \n  \n \n  Getting professional help if you think you need it\n \n  It’s normal to feel overwhelmed sometimes by caregiver responsibilities. But if it becomes a constant problem, you may need to see a mental health professional. Below is a list of serious signs of trouble. Get professional help if you:\n \n   \n   Feel depressed, physically sick, or hopeless\n \n   Feel like hurting yourself or hurting or yelling at the people you care for\n \n   Depend too heavily on alcohol or recreational drugs\n \n   Fight with your spouse, children, stepchildren, or other family members and friends\n \n   Are no longer taking care of yourself\n \n  \n \n  Take a break or time for yourself\n \n  Most caregivers hesitate to take a break from their caregiving responsibilities, even for a short time. In fact, most would probably feel guilty if they did this.  Try to get out of the house and away from your loved one every day – even if it’s only to take a short walk or shop for food. If you can’t leave the patient alone and don’t have friends or family to relieve you, you might want to look into getting help from respite caregivers.\n \n  \n \n  Respite care is the term used to describe short-term, temporary relief for those who are caring for family members who might otherwise need professional care. Respite is a short break from the exhausting challenges of being a caregiver. It’s been shown to help keep family caregivers healthy and improve their sense of well-being.\n \n  In most cases, the respite caregiver comes to the home and gets to know the patient, the family routine, and things like where medicines are stored. Sitter-companion services are one respite option. This is sometimes offered by local civic groups, church or religious groups, and other community organizations. A regular sitter-companion can provide friendly respite care for a few hours, once or twice a week. Be sure that the sitter-companion knows what to do if there’s an emergency while the caregiver is gone.\n \n  Another type of respite uses a specialized, local facility where the patient may stay for a few days or even a few weeks. This gives the caregiver a chance to take a vacation from caregiving and catch their breath, whether or not they leave town.\n \n  Depending on your state, Medicaid or Medicare may help cover respite costs. Also check with the patient’s health insurance to see what kind of respite help might be offered.\n \n  Know what you can’t do\n \n  Caregiving alone for any period of time is not realistic. Reach out to others. Involve them in your life and in the things you must do for your loved one.\n \n  Some caregivers feel they have to do it all alone. They may believe that, as the partner, sibling, son, or daughter they’re responsible for the sick loved one. It’s painful for them to admit that they can’t do it all and still keep their own health and sanity. They’ll bend over backward to meet their loved one’s every need. Some feel guilty if they can’t do it all and say they feel “selfish” if they ask for help.\n \n  Set realistic limits on what you can do. For instance, if you have a back injury, and/or if your loved one is too big for you to lift, you may be able to help them roll over in bed, but don’t try to lift them alone or catch them when they fall. (You may end up seriously injured or sick and become unable to help anyone.) There are ways you can safely help a person sit up or walk but you have to learn to do it without hurting yourself. This is where expert help is needed – home care nurses or physical therapists can show you how to do it safely. They can also help you get special equipment, if needed.\n \n  \n \n   \n  \n \n  When you need help, reach out to others, including professionals. Talk with the cancer care team about what you’re doing and where you need help. Involve them in your life and your loved one’s care.\n \n  Finding support for yourself\n \n  The support of friends and family is key to both the person with cancer and the caregiver. There are many kinds of support programs, including one-on-one or group counseling and support groups. A support group can be a powerful tool for both people with cancer and those who care about them. Talking with others who are in situations like yours can help ease loneliness. You can also get useful ideas from others that might help you.\n \n  Talk with a nurse or social worker or contact your local American Cancer Society to learn about services in your area. Talking with other caregivers can help you feel less alone. If you can’t visit a group in person, the American Cancer Society has the Cancer Survivors Network (CSN), an online community of people whose lives have been touched by cancer. Other organizations have internet-based groups and even online counseling, too. Through online or in person support groups, people can share their stories, offer practical advice, and support each other through shared experiences.\n \n  Religion can be a source of strength for some people. Some members of the clergy are specially trained to help people with cancer and their families. People who are not religious may find spiritual support in other ways. Meditation, journaling, and being outside in nature are examples of different ways a person may feel they’re part of something greater than themselves.\n \n  Ask others to help\n \n  Caregivers need a range of support services to stay healthy, be good caregivers, and stay in the caregiving role. But they often don’t know where to go for help or how to accept help.\n \n  Caregivers have been shown to have less distress and feel less burdened when they have social support. Human connections can help you stay strong. Let people know what you need and ask for help. You cannot and should not try to be responsible for all the caregiving by yourself.\n \n  You need to know who you can talk to and count on for help. Families facing cancer can become stronger. If family members don’t offer help, or if you need more help than they can give you, you may be able to set up a circle of friends to help you. Church members, neighbors, and others may be willing to help. Include them in “family meetings.” Share information with them on the patient’s condition, needs, and care.\n \n  Allowing others to help can take some of the pressure off and give you time to take care of yourself. Often family and friends want to help but may not know how or what you need. Here are some tips for including family and friends:\n \n   \n   Look for situations where you need help. Make a list or note them on a calendar.\n \n   Hold regular family meetings to keep everyone involved. Use these meetings as updates and care-planning sessions. Include the patient.\n \n   Ask family and friends when they can help and what jobs they think they can do. You may also contact a person with a certain request. Be very clear about what you need.\n \n   As you hear back from each person, note it on your list to make sure they have taken care of what you needed.\n \n  \n \n  There are many online resources that can help you manage your job as caregiver. Some sites offer support for people caring for a loved one who has cancer. Other sites have features like group calendars to organize helpers and areas to create personal websites that concerned people can access for updates. . Some of these also allow others to sign up for specific tasks when help is needed. Taking full advantage of the resources available to you is another way you can take care of yourself.\n \n  Caring for your children during this time\n \n  If you have young children, you’ll need to figure out how to take care of them and their needs while you’re caring for the person with cancer. Juggling children’s schedules and trying to keep their lives as normal as possible often requires a great deal more help from friends and family members. As you’re setting up care for the person with cancer, you might also need to tap into other parents and trusted friends and neighbors for help with your children.\n \n  Children can sense stress in their family members and notice that there’s less time for them. They may start to have trouble in school or act like they did when they were younger. Even though your time is limited, you’ll need to take time to check in with them to learn about their fears and concerns.\n \n  For more information, see Helping Children With Cancer in the Family: Dealing with Diagnosis and Helping Children With Cancer in the Family: Dealing With Treatment.\n \n  Being a caregiver and keeping your job\n \n  Caregiving itself can be a full-time job, but many caregivers already have paying jobs. This can lead to work-related issues like missed days, low productivity, and work interruptions. Some caregivers even need to take unpaid leave, turn down promotions, or lose work benefits. The stress of caring for someone on top of worrying about keeping your job can be overwhelming. Dealing with these issues is important to both the employer and the employee.\n \n  There will be times when there will be more demands on the caregiver, for instance, when the patient is diagnosed, getting cancer treatment, getting treatment for recurrence, or nearing the end of life. The employed caregiver may end up having to take time off from their paying job for caregiving.\n \n  For people in certain types of jobs (temps, freelancers, consultants, entrepreneurs), this is very difficult. If they don’t work, they don’t get paid. For those with traditional jobs in larger companies, there may be benefits to help you take time off and still keep your job.\n \n  Some people find that there’s no one else to care for the cancer patient on a long-term basis, and cut back to working part time. Some feel that they have to quit their jobs entirely. If you need to keep your job but the interruptions and time off are creating problems, you might want to look into a different schedule to fit the times your loved one needs you most. Some companies allow you to take some paid leave if you are caring for a spouse or close relative. You might be able to work half-days or split shifts, or take one day a week off for doctor visits, for example.\n \n  If you need some time away from work, speak with your boss or benefits office. If your workplace has an Employee Assistance Program, look into what it offers. Some offer counseling services for money concerns, stress, and depression.\n \n  The Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) guarantees up to 12 weeks off per year to take care of a seriously ill family member (spouse, parent, or child). It only applies to larger companies, and not every employee qualifies for it. If you can’t or don’t want to stop working, you might be able to take unpaid time off under the FMLA.\n \n  You may find that the people you work with treat you differently because of the time you must spend on caregiving tasks. This can affect you personally, as well as financially.\n \n  Keeping your health insurance if you have to quit your job\n \n  When caregivers quit their jobs, they usually lose their employer’s health insurance coverage as well as their source of income. It’s very important for you still to have some type of health care coverage. If you’re able to pay for your own insurance, COBRA will allow you to be covered for some months after you leave your job. Another option might be insurance from the Health Insurance Marketplace.\n \n  If you make mistakes\n \n  No matter what you do, you will very likely come to a point where you feel that you’ve failed in some way. It seems obvious that as a caregiver, you do the best you can. You try to include the patient, other concerned family members, and close friends in important discussions. You always try to make decisions that are in the patient’s best interest – decisions that you and the patient can live with. But sometimes you’ll feel that you could have handled a situation better or done something a better way.\n \n  At these times, it’s important not to blame yourself. Find a way to forgive yourself and move on. It helps to keep in mind that you will keep making mistakes, just like everyone else. Try to keep a sense of humor about it. And try to recognize those things that you do well, too. These things are often easy to overlook. It also helps to keep in mind why you chose to take on this often difficult and stressful job.\n \n  As a caregiver, you have an important and unique role in helping your loved one through their cancer experience. The American Cancer Society can offer you information, resources, and support. Call us at 1-800-227-2345 any day and any time you need help for yourself or your loved one.\n"

        "text": "The kind of support that a caregiver provides will be different for each person. In general, caregiving support falls into one of three areas: informational, practical and emotional. This booklet provides examples of how caregivers can help in each of these areas.\nInformational Support\nA person diagnosed with cancer can feel overwhelmed and may need informational support (whether written, visual, audio or verbal) directly related to their diagnosis and treatment. Here are specific types of support caregivers can provide:\n Ask for information from your loved one’s health care team and ask what additional resources they recommend.\n Your loved one’s health care team can provide information on potential side effects, based on the specific drug or drugs used in treatment. It may be helpful to ask the health care team about common concerns, challenges, symptoms and side effects to expect as well as circumstances that need immediate attention.\n As you help your loved one manage their cancer, it’s important to remember that you are both consumers of health care. In addition to educating yourself about the diagnosis and treatment options, get to know the members of their health care team, including doctors, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, nurses, dietitians, psychologists, occupational therapists, physical therapists, chaplains, social workers and patient navigators. Here are a few things you, as a caregiver, can do to ensure that communication with the extended health care team is as effective as it can be:\n Having a health care journal or notebook (either on paper or in a digital format) will allow your loved one to keep all of their health information in one place. It should include the names and contact information (and photos if possible) of the members of their health care team and details of their treatment plan. The journal can also be used as a diary to capture their experiences while undergoing treatment and your experiences as a caregiver.\n This list should include your questions and concerns as well as those of your loved one. Because the doctor may have limited time, create the list in order of importance. If the doctor has limited time, consider which questions may be best addressed by other members of the health care team.\n Even if they have a journal and a prepared list of questions or concerns, it’s always helpful for them to have support at appointments. You may think of additional questions to ask, or remember details about their symptoms, treatment, or overall quality of life that they may have forgotten. If you can’t be there in person for whatever reason, see if you can arrange to provide support via the phone or your mobile device.\n Taking notes will help you and your loved one remember the doctor’s responses, advice and instructions. If you have a mobile device, ask if you can use it to take notes or record the discussion, which will help you review the information later.\nPractical Support\nThere are many ways that caregivers can help with practical matters (the activities of daily living), including:\n Depending on how they are feeling, people going through cancer treatment may need help with a number of activities they would normally handle themselves, such as bathing, eating, toileting, or dressing. Ask your loved one to let you know if they want help with these activities. Some people may want help, but would prefer that it is provided by a paid helper, rather than a spouse, adult child, significant other or friend. If that’s the case with your loved one, ask a member of their health care team for recommendations on local home health and community agencies that can provide these services.\n As a caregiver, you may be involved in some health care tasks that are more typically handled by a nurse, such as administering medication, monitoring symptoms and changing bandages. If you need help with these health care needs, ask the doctor, nurse or hospital social worker about local home health agencies that can send in-home nurses to provide these (and other) services.\n Keeping track of prescription and over-the-counter medications can be a challenge under any circumstances. An inexpensive pill organizer (available at most drugstores) allows for the sorting of medications by day of week and time of day. There are also free medication reminder Household tasks and errands. If you are a caregiver to a spouse or significant other, you may already be handling a large share of household tasks and errands. This would be a good time to take short-term responsibility for additional chores, if possible.\nEmotional Support\nIt’s hard to watch someone you care about go through the difficult emotions that may arise with a cancer diagnosis, which can range from denial to sadness to anger. There are things you, as a caregiver, can do to help both of you cope:\n It’s important to listen without judging, dismissing or “cheerleading.” Simply listening to and validating what your loved one is expressing can be one of the most important contributions you make.\n While you may be in a position to share decision making, ultimately it is your loved one who bears the impact of their cancer and its treatment.\n Joining a support group gives your loved one a chance to talk with others coping with cancer and learn what they do to manage difficult emotions. Ask a hospital social worker for a referral, or contact CancerCare\n.\nCancerCare\n offers free face-to-face, telephone and online support groups for people affected by cancer. There are also support groups specifically for caregivers that may be available.\n The end of treatment means fewer meetings with the health care team, whose support you have likely relied on. You may also have questions about how to transition away from being a caregiver, so getting support during this transition can be helpful.\n",

        "text": "Taking care of a loved one can be a positive experience, but it can also feel like a full-time job and be very stressful. Many caregivers tend to put their own needs and feelings aside; however, it’s important for you to take good care of yourself. Here are some tips to help you do so:\n Consider using My Cancer Circle™ (mycancercircle.net) to organize help from friends and family. My Cancer Circle is a free, private, and customizable online tool that enables people facing cancer to organize and coordinate a circle of family members and friends to provide practical and emotional support. This tool provides caregivers of people facing cancer a simple, effective answer to a question they are constantly asked, “What can we do to help?” In addition to family, friends and neighbors, look for professional or volunteer resources in your community.\n Experts recommend at least 150 minutes (2.5 hours) of moderate-intensity aerobicactivity per week, preferably spread throughout the week. Aerobic activity includes the use of cardio machines, walking, running, hiking, swimming and dancing. If there are hobbies that you enjoyed prior to becoming a caregiver, it may be important for your overall wellbeing and quality of life to continue to spend some time on those hobbies when possible.\n Keeping a balanced diet is an important part of taking care of yourself. Include fruits and vegetables in your meals. Nuts, yogurt and peanut butter are easy snacks with lots of protein that will keep your energy level up. Pack snacks if you know you will be with your loved one at the doctor’s office or the hospital for an extended period of time.\n Caregiving can be emotionally and physically draining, and you should try to get enough sleep. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends at least seven hours per night for adults. Also, take naps during the day if you need them.\n Your health is very valuable. Stay on top of your own medical appointments, and have a system for remembering to take any medicines you need to stay healthy.\n Caregiving is hard work that can affect your emotional well-being. Taking care of yourself includes coping with many of your own feelings that come up as you care for your loved one. Here are some tips to help you cope:\n Take some time for yourself regularly. Even if it’s just for a few minutes, doing something you like can help you recharge.\n Ask friends or family members if they would be willing to be “on call” in times of stress. You can also plan a regular “check-in” time. And be sure to make time for socializing with friends or family, preferably outside of your home.\n Many caregivers feel overwhelmed and alone. Speaking with a counselor or oncology social worker may help you cope. CancerCare\n’s oncology social workers are just a phone call away.\n CancerCare\n offers free face-to-face, telephone and online support groups for caregivers. These groups provide a safe haven where you can share your concerns and learn from others who are going through a similar situation.\n",

        "text": "Guidance For CaregiversGeneral Side Effects\nSome side effects can occur across treatment approaches. This section, for you to share with your loved one, provides tips and guidance on how to manage these side effects should they occur.\nIt’s important that side effects are reported right away so that your loved one’s health care team can help manage them. Not all people being treated for cancer experience all of these side effects and people may experience treatment-specific side effects not listed here.\nManaging Digestive Tract Symptoms\nNausea and vomiting\nAvoid food with strong odors, as well as overly sweet, greasy, fried or highly seasoned food.\nEat meals that are chilled, which often makes food more easily tolerated.\nNibble on dry crackers or toast. These bland foods are easy on the stomach.\nHaving something in your stomach when you take medication may help ease nausea.\nConstipation\nAs hydration is important to avoid constipation, make sure to drink plenty of fluids. Also, limit your intake of caffeine and alcoholic beverages, as they can cause dehydration.\nInclude foods high in fiber in your daily diet, such as fruit (especially pears and prunes), vegetables and cereals. If your health care team approves, you may want to add synthetic fiber to your diet, such as Metamucil, Citrucel or FiberCon.\nBe as physically active as you can, after checking with your health care team on the level of physical activity that is right for you.\nIf your doctor has prescribed a “bowel regimen,” make sure to follow it exactly.\nDiarrhea\nDrink plenty of water. Ask your doctor about using drinks such as Gatorade which provide electrolytes. Electrolytes are body salts that must stay in balance for cells to work properly.\nOver-the-counter medicines such as loperamide (Imodium A-D and others) and prescription drugs are available for diarrhea but should be used only if necessary. If the diarrhea is bad enough that you need medicine, discuss it with your doctor or nurse.\nChoose fiber-dense foods such as whole grains, fruits and vegetables, all of which help form stools.\nAvoid food high in refined sugar and those sweetened with sugar alcohols such as sorbitol and mannitol.\nManaging Loss of Appetite\nEating small meals throughout the day is an easy way to take in more protein and calories, which will help maintain your weight. Try to include protein in every meal.\nTo keep from feeling full early, avoid liquids with meals or take only small sips (unless you need liquids to help swallow). Drink most of your liquids between meals.\nKeep high-calorie, high-protein snacks on hand such as hard-boiled eggs, peanut butter, cheese, ice cream, granola bars, liquid nutritional supplements, puddings, nuts, canned tuna or trail mix.\nIf you are struggling to maintain your appetite, talk to your health care team about whether appetite-building medication could be right for you.\nManaging Fatigue\nFatigue (extreme tiredness not helped by sleep) is one of the most common side effects of many cancer treatments. Here are a few tips that may help reduce fatigue:\nTake several short naps or breaks during the day.\nTake short walks or do some light exercise, if possible.\nTry easier or shorter versions of the activities you enjoy.\nAsk your family or friends to help you with tasks you find difficult or tiring.\nSave your energy for things you find most important.\nThere are also prescription medications that may help. Your health care team can provide guidance on whether medication is the right approach for your individual circumstances.\nFatigue can be a symptom of other illnesses, such as anemia, diabetes, thyroid problems, heart disease, rheumatoid arthritis or depression. Be sure to ask your doctor if they think any of these conditions may be contributing to your fatigue.\nIt can also be beneficial to speak with an oncology social worker or oncology nurse to help manage your fatigue. These professionals can work with you to manage any emotional or practical concerns that may be causing symptoms and help you find ways to cope.\nManaging Flu-Like Symptoms\nThe fever and aches that may occur with treatment can be managed with a combination of rest and medication. Acetaminophen (such as Tylenol) is often a doctor’s first choice to treat these symptoms. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can also help, but should be taken only if recommended by your doctor, as they can cause other side effects. NSAIDs include aspirin, ibuprofen (Motrin and others) and naproxen (Naprelan, Midol, Aleve and others).\nRemember to Take Care of YourselfFrequently Asked Questions\n Here are some questions you should ask; others will likely arise in the course of your discussion.\nWhat are the goals of treatment?\nHow long will treatment last?\nDo you have any written information about this treatment?\nWhat medical procedures and expenses does my insurance plan cover?\nWhat are the side effects of this treatment?\nAre there any ways to help manage side effects?\nHow do we know if a side effect is severe enough to call you?\nAre there any other treatment options?\nAre there any clinical trials we should be aware of?\nWhat is the best way to let you know when we have questions about treatment?\nHow frequent are medical appointments? What can we expect during the appointments?\n Even from a distance, you can provide ongoing emotional support to your sister and to her primary caregiver. It is sometimes easier for people to talk about difficult topics over the phone than in person, so be willing to have in-depth and serious conversations. You can also help coordinate medical appointments (and send reminders to your sister and her caregiver about those appointments), attend telehealth appointments, provide verbal updates to other family members and share information on how your sister is feeling (if she agrees) in an on-line journal such as CaringBridge. If you think it would be helpful, you can also send periodic “care packages” containing things your sister would enjoy.\n Here is a description of these two government programs.\nMedicare is a federal health insurance program for individuals 65 or over.

They may live with, nearby or far away from the person they support.\nPlease remember that if you are a caregiver, you do not have to be alone as you provide support to your loved one with cancer. People in your personal network (family, friends, partners/spouses, neighbors) may be eager to help, especially if you are specific in your needs and requests. As a caregiver, be sure to take some time to think about the people in your life and how they are best suited to help you, and match your request to their strengths. For example, you might ask a friend or family member who loves to shop to pick up a few things at the store; ask a friend who’s a good listener to come over for a chat with you and your loved one; ask a family member or friend who has extra time to spend a few hours with your loved one so you can run errands or take a break.\nThere are also professional resources available to you, including the oncology social workers at CancerCare, who are specially trained to help people and their caregivers cope with the emotional and practical challenges of cancer. Additional resources are listed at the end of this booklet.\n",

        "text": "The kind of support that a caregiver provides will be different for each person. In general, caregiving support falls into one of three areas: informational, practical and emotional. This booklet provides examples of how caregivers can help in each of these areas.\nInformational Support\nA person diagnosed with cancer can feel overwhelmed and may need informational support (whether written, visual, audio or verbal) directly related to their diagnosis and treatment. Here are specific types of support caregivers can provide:\n Ask for information from your loved one’s health care team and ask what additional resources they recommend.\n Your loved one’s health care team can provide information on potential side effects, based on the specific drug or drugs used in treatment. It may be helpful to ask the health care team about common concerns, challenges, symptoms and side effects to expect as well as circumstances that need immediate attention.\n As you help your loved one manage their cancer, it’s important to remember that you are both consumers of health care. In addition to educating yourself about the diagnosis and treatment options, get to know the members of their health care team, including doctors, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, nurses, dietitians, psychologists, occupational therapists, physical therapists, chaplains, social workers and patient navigators. Here are a few things you, as a caregiver, can do to ensure that communication with the extended health care team is as effective as it can be:\n Having a health care journal or notebook (either on paper or in a digital format) will allow your loved one to keep all of their health information in one place. It should include the names and contact information (and photos if possible) of the members of their health care team and details of their treatment plan. The journal can also be used as a diary to capture their experiences while undergoing treatment and your experiences as a caregiver.\n This list should include your questions and concerns as well as those of your loved one. Because the doctor may have limited time, create the list in order of importance. If the doctor has limited time, consider which questions may be best addressed by other members of the health care team.\n Even if they have a journal and a prepared list of questions or concerns, it’s always helpful for them to have support at appointments. You may think of additional questions to ask, or remember details about their symptoms, treatment, or overall quality of life that they may have forgotten. If you can’t be there in person for whatever reason, see if you can arrange to provide support via the phone or your mobile device.\n Taking notes will help you and your loved one remember the doctor’s responses, advice and instructions. If you have a mobile device, ask if you can use it to take notes or record the discussion, which will help you review the information later.\nPractical Support\nThere are many ways that caregivers can help with practical matters (the activities of daily living), including:\n Depending on how they are feeling, people going through cancer treatment may need help with a number of activities they would normally handle themselves, such as bathing, eating, toileting, or dressing. Ask your loved one to let you know if they want help with these activities. Some people may want help, but would prefer that it is provided by a paid helper, rather than a spouse, adult child, significant other or friend. If that’s the case with your loved one, ask a member of their health care team for recommendations on local home health and community agencies that can provide these services.\n As a caregiver, you may be involved in some health care tasks that are more typically handled by a nurse, such as administering medication, monitoring symptoms and changing bandages. If you need help with these health care needs, ask the doctor, nurse or hospital social worker about local home health agencies that can send in-home nurses to provide these (and other) services.\n Keeping track of prescription and over-the-counter medications can be a challenge under any circumstances. An inexpensive pill organizer (available at most drugstores) allows for the sorting of medications by day of week and time of day. There are also free medication reminder Household tasks and errands. If you are a caregiver to a spouse or significant other, you may already be handling a large share of household tasks and errands. This would be a good time to take short-term responsibility for additional chores, if possible.\nEmotional Support\nIt’s hard to watch someone you care about go through the difficult emotions that may arise with a cancer diagnosis, which can range from denial to sadness to anger. There are things you, as a caregiver, can do to help both of you cope:\n It’s important to listen without judging, dismissing or “cheerleading.” Simply listening to and validating what your loved one is expressing can be one of the most important contributions you make.\n While you may be in a position to share decision making, ultimately it is your loved one who bears the impact of their cancer and its treatment.\n Joining a support group gives your loved one a chance to talk with others coping with cancer and learn what they do to manage difficult emotions. Ask a hospital social worker for a referral, or contact CancerCare\n.\nCancerCare\n offers free face-to-face, telephone and online support groups for people affected by cancer. There are also support groups specifically for caregivers that may be available.\n The end of treatment means fewer meetings with the health care team, whose support you have likely relied on. You may also have questions about how to transition away from being a caregiver, so getting support during this transition can be helpful.\n",

        "text": "Taking care of a loved one can be a positive experience, but it can also feel like a full-time job and be very stressful. Many caregivers tend to put their own needs and feelings aside; however, it’s important for you to take good care of yourself. Here are some tips to help you do so:\n Consider using My Cancer Circle™ (mycancercircle.net) to organize help from friends and family. My Cancer Circle is a free, private, and customizable online tool that enables people facing cancer to organize and coordinate a circle of family members and friends to provide practical and emotional support. This tool provides caregivers of people facing cancer a simple, effective answer to a question they are constantly asked, “What can we do to help?” In addition to family, friends and neighbors, look for professional or volunteer resources in your community.\n Experts recommend at least 150 minutes (2.5 hours) of moderate-intensity aerobicactivity per week, preferably spread throughout the week. Aerobic activity includes the use of cardio machines, walking, running, hiking, swimming and dancing. If there are hobbies that you enjoyed prior to becoming a caregiver, it may be important for your overall wellbeing and quality of life to continue to spend some time on those hobbies when possible.\n Keeping a balanced diet is an important part of taking care of yourself. Include fruits and vegetables in your meals. Nuts, yogurt and peanut butter are easy snacks with lots of protein that will keep your energy level up. Pack snacks if you know you will be with your loved one at the doctor’s office or the hospital for an extended period of time.\n Caregiving can be emotionally and physically draining, and you should try to get enough sleep. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends at least seven hours per night for adults. Also, take naps during the day if you need them.\n Your health is very valuable. Stay on top of your own medical appointments, and have a system for remembering to take any medicines you need to stay healthy.\n Caregiving is hard work that can affect your emotional well-being. Taking care of yourself includes coping with many of your own feelings that come up as you care for your loved one. Here are some tips to help you cope:\n Take some time for yourself regularly. Even if it’s just for a few minutes, doing something you like can help you recharge.\n Ask friends or family members if they would be willing to be “on call” in times of stress. You can also plan a regular “check-in” time. And be sure to make time for socializing with friends or family, preferably outside of your home.\n Many caregivers feel overwhelmed and alone. Speaking with a counselor or oncology social worker may help you cope. CancerCare\n’s oncology social workers are just a phone call away.\n CancerCare\n offers free face-to-face, telephone and online support groups for caregivers. These groups provide a safe haven where you can share your concerns and learn from others who are going through a similar situation.\n",

        "text": "Some side effects can occur across treatment approaches. This section, for you to share with your loved one, provides tips and guidance on how to manage these side effects should they occur.\nIt’s important that side effects are reported right away so that your loved one’s health care team can help manage them. Not all people being treated for cancer experience all of these side effects and people may experience treatment-specific side effects not listed here.\nManaging Digestive Tract Symptoms\nNausea and vomiting\nAvoid food with strong odors, as well as overly sweet, greasy, fried or highly seasoned food.\nEat meals that are chilled, which often makes food more easily tolerated.\nNibble on dry crackers or toast. These bland foods are easy on the stomach.\nHaving something in your stomach when you take medication may help ease nausea.\nConstipation\nAs hydration is important to avoid constipation, make sure to drink plenty of fluids. Also, limit your intake of caffeine and alcoholic beverages, as they can cause dehydration.\nInclude foods high in fiber in your daily diet, such as fruit (especially pears and prunes), vegetables and cereals. If your health care team approves, you may want to add synthetic fiber to your diet, such as Metamucil, Citrucel or FiberCon.\nBe as physically active as you can, after checking with your health care team on the level of physical activity that is right for you.\nIf your doctor has prescribed a “bowel regimen,” make sure to follow it exactly.\nDiarrhea\nDrink plenty of water. Ask your doctor about using drinks such as Gatorade which provide electrolytes. Electrolytes are body salts that must stay in balance for cells to work properly.\nOver-the-counter medicines such as loperamide (Imodium A-D and others) and prescription drugs are available for diarrhea but should be used only if necessary. If the diarrhea is bad enough that you need medicine, discuss it with your doctor or nurse.\nChoose fiber-dense foods such as whole grains, fruits and vegetables, all of which help form stools.\nAvoid food high in refined sugar and those sweetened with sugar alcohols such as sorbitol and mannitol.\nManaging Loss of Appetite\nEating small meals throughout the day is an easy way to take in more protein and calories, which will help maintain your weight. Try to include protein in every meal.\nTo keep from feeling full early, avoid liquids with meals or take only small sips (unless you need liquids to help swallow). Drink most of your liquids between meals.\nKeep high-calorie, high-protein snacks on hand such as hard-boiled eggs, peanut butter, cheese, ice cream, granola bars, liquid nutritional supplements, puddings, nuts, canned tuna or trail mix.\nIf you are struggling to maintain your appetite, talk to your health care team about whether appetite-building medication could be right for you.\nManaging Fatigue\nFatigue (extreme tiredness not helped by sleep) is one of the most common side effects of many cancer treatments. Here are a few tips that may help reduce fatigue:\nTake several short naps or breaks during the day.\nTake short walks or do some light exercise, if possible.\nTry easier or shorter versions of the activities you enjoy.\nAsk your family or friends to help you with tasks you find difficult or tiring.\nSave your energy for things you find most important.\nThere are also prescription medications that may help. Your health care team can provide guidance on whether medication is the right approach for your individual circumstances.\nFatigue can be a symptom of other illnesses, such as anemia, diabetes, thyroid problems, heart disease, rheumatoid arthritis or depression. Be sure to ask your doctor if they think any of these conditions may be contributing to your fatigue.\nIt can also be beneficial to speak with an oncology social worker or oncology nurse to help manage your fatigue. These professionals can work with you to manage any emotional or practical concerns that may be causing symptoms and help you find ways to cope.\nManaging Flu-Like Symptoms\nThe fever and aches that may occur with treatment can be managed with a combination of rest and medication.

In young women, enlargement of an ovary is likely to be caused by a noncancerous fluid-filled sac (ovarian cyst     Functional cysts  Noncancerous (benign) ovarian growths include cysts (mainly functional cysts) and tumors.

However, after menopause, an enlarged ovary can be a sign of ovarian cancer.\n Many women have no symptoms until the cancer is advanced. The first symptom may be vague discomfort in the lower abdomen, similar to indigestion. Other symptoms may include bloating, loss of appetite (because the stomach is compressed), gas pains, and backache. Ovarian cancer rarely causes vaginal bleeding.\n Eventually, the abdomen may swell because the ovary enlarges or fluid accumulates in the abdomen (called ascites     Ascites  Ascites is the accumulation of protein-containing (ascitic) fluid within the abdomen. Many disorders can cause ascites, but the most common is high blood pressure in the veins that bring blood...  read more     ). At this stage, pain in the pelvic area, anemia, and weight loss are common.\n Rarely, germ cell or stromal cell tumors produce estrogens, which can cause tissue in the uterine lining to grow excessively and breasts to enlarge. Or these tumors may produce male hormones (androgens), which can cause body hair to grow excessively, or hormones that resemble thyroid hormones, which can cause symptoms of an overactive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism     Hyperthyroidism  Hyperthyroidism is overactivity of the thyroid gland that leads to high levels of thyroid hormones and speeding up of vital body functions.

        "text": "  Diagnosis of Ovarian Cancer \n    Ultrasonography\n Sometimes computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging\n Blood tests \n Diagnosing ovarian cancer in its early stages is difficult because symptoms usually do not appear until the cancer is quite large or has spread beyond the ovaries and because many less serious disorders cause similar symptoms.\n If doctors detect an enlarged ovary during a physical examination or suspect early ovarian cancer based on symptoms, ultrasonography is done first. Sometimes computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is used to help distinguish an ovarian cyst from a solid cancerous mass. If advanced cancer is suspected, CT or MRI is usually done before surgery to determine extent of the cancer.\n If cancer seems unlikely, doctors reexamine the woman periodically.\n If doctors suspect cancer or test results are unclear, blood tests are usually done to measure levels of substances that may indicate the presence of cancer (tumor markers), such as cancer antigen 125 (CA 125). Abnormal tumor marker levels alone do not confirm the diagnosis of cancer, but when combined with other information, they can support the diagnosis.\n To confirm the diagnosis of ovarian cancer and to determine whether and how far the cancer has spread (its stage), doctors examine the ovaries in one of two ways: \n   Doctors may use a thin, flexible viewing tube (laparoscope) inserted through a small incision just below the navel, particularly if they think the cancer is not advanced. They use instruments threaded through the laparoscope, sometimes with robotic assistance, to take samples from various other tissues and to examine the ovaries and other organs. The information thus obtained can help doctors determine whether and how far the cancer has spread (its stage). The ovaries can also be removed to treat ovarian cancer using laparoscopy.\n  If doctors think the cancer may be advanced, they make an incision in the abdomen and directly view the uterus and the tissues around it. They determine the cancer's stage and remove as much of the cancer as possible.\n Doctors consider recommending genetic testing for any woman who is diagnosed with ovarian (or fallopian tube) cancer. Doctors also ask about any cancers family members have had. This information can help doctors identify women who are more likely to have a hereditary form of cancer, such as that caused by mutations in  genes.\n    Staging of ovarian cancer \n   Stages are based on how far the cancer has spread. Stages range from I (the earliest) to IV (advanced):\n  Stage I: The cancer occurs only in one or both ovaries (or fallopian tubes).\n Stage II: The cancer has spread to the uterus, or nearby tissues within the pelvis (which contains the internal reproductive organs, bladder, and rectum).\n Stage III: The cancer has spread outside the pelvis to lymph nodes and/or to other parts of the abdomen (such as the surface of the liver or spleen).\n Stage IV: The cancer has spread outside the pelvis (for example, to the lung). \n",

If first- or second-degree relatives have such cancers, particularly among Ashkenazi Jewish families, women should discuss genetic testing for  abnormalities with their doctors. \n Women with certain  gene mutations may be offered the option of having both ovaries and fallopian tubes removed after they no longer wish to bear children, even when no cancer is present. This approach eliminates the risk of ovarian cancer and reduces the risk of breast cancer.

This approach aims to remove all visible cancer.\n If a woman has stage I cancer that affects only one ovary and she wishes to become pregnant, doctors may remove only the affected ovary and fallopian tube. \n For more advanced cancers that have spread to other parts of the body, doctors usually remove as much of the cancer as possible to prolong survival. This type of surgery is called cytoreductive surgery. However, depending on where the cancer has spread and how much cancer is present, women may be treated with chemotherapy instead of or before and after surgery.\n After surgery, most women with less aggressive stage I epithelial carcinomas require no further treatment. For other stage I cancers or for more advanced cancers, chemotherapy may be used to destroy any small areas of cancer that may remain. Typically, chemotherapy consists of paclitaxel combined with carboplatin.\n Most women with germ cell tumors can be cured with removal of the one affected ovary and fallopian tube plus combination chemotherapy, usually with bleomycin, cisplatin, and etoposide. Radiation therapy is rarely used.\n Advanced ovarian cancer usually recurs. So after chemotherapy, doctors typically measure levels of cancer markers (such as CA 125). Cancer marker levels that remain high usually mean that some of the tumor remains.\n If the cancer recurs after chemotherapy appeared to be effective, chemotherapy is repeated. Many different chemotherapy drugs or combinations of drugs may be used.\n",

Someone who has these problems could fall when trying to get out of bed, using the toilet, taking a bath or shower, or walking.\n \n  Managing balance problems and falls\n \n  Your health care team can look for certain factors that could increase your risk of falling:\n \n   \n   A history of falling\n \n   Changes in vision\n \n   Changes in mood, memory/confusion\n    , or coordination\n \n   Muscle weakness, fatigue\n     or changes in how you walk (gait)\n \n   Neuropathy\n    \n \n   Bowel and bladder problems\n    \n \n   Low blood counts\n    \n \n   Environmental risks around the home (ie clutter, dim lights,pets that may be a tripping hazard, uneven floors, or stairs)\n \n   Changes in medication\n \n   Changes in nutritional status\n \n  \n \n  Your health care team may have you work with a physical or occupational therapist and home health care to find different ways to lower your risk of falling. These specialists may also teach you certain exercises or how to use equipment (wheelchair, walker, cane) that can help with daily routines (transportation, preparing meals, shopping, or grooming). Strength training and coordination exercises, along with equipment to assist you, can all help improve your safety, balance, coordination, and strength.\n \n  Managing cancer symptoms and other medical conditions may also be part of managing your balance problems and falls. Fatigue, confusion, and low blood counts are some common symptoms that occur with cancer and its treatment. These conditions may add to problems with balance and falling.\n \n  Different medications\n    can also affect these symptoms and your risk of falling. It's important that you review both your medication list and any new symptoms with your health care team regularly so they can adjust your medicines and treat symptoms as early as possible.\n \n  What the patient can do\n \n   \n   Go over your list of medicines with your health care team. Use only one pharmacy to fill your prescriptions, this may help keep track of ongoing medication changes.\n \n   If you notice you're having problems with weakness, poor balance, changes in mood or memory, ask for help getting up or walking.\n \n   If you fall, let your cancer care team and your caregivers know. They’ll want to help prevent future falls, and might need to check you for injuries.\n \n   If you have trouble walking, ask about a home health nursing visit. A home health team may be able to make your surroundings safer for you. They also have ways to help you walk more safely.\n \n   If a walker or wheelchair is recommended, keep it by the bed or next to where you sit. Use it every time you get up, even for short trips.\n \n  \n \n  What caregivers can do\n   \n \n   \n   Report any signs of memory or mood changes, or confusion to the cancer care team.\n \n   Report any changes to the medication or vitamin list to the cancer care team. Also report if the patient is not taking medications, vitamins, or supplements as directed (non-compliant).\n \n   When the patient needs to get out of bed, first sit them on the side of the bed for a minute or so. This will help if changing positions makes them feel dizzy or unsteady.\n \n   If the patient is unsteady, help them walk.\n \n   If the patient feels light-headed, stay with them when they go to the bathroom.\n \n   Remind the patient to call for help before trying to get up.\n \n   In the tub or shower, use bath mats or non-slip stickers, and grab bars. You can also put a stool\n     or chair in the shower so the patient can sit while bathing.\n \n   Keep electric cords off the floor. Walking paths need to be clear of clothing, throw rugs, and other items that can cause tripping or slipping.\n \n   Tape the edges of rugs to the floor. There also is special tape for the underside of rugs to keep them from moving.\n \n   Have a bedpan or urinal within easy reach, place a commode near the bed, or put the bed near a bathroom.\n \n   The patient should wear shoes, non-skid socks or slippers when walking or standing. Avoid using slippery shoes or open-heel bedroom slippers.\n \n   Ask about a home health nursing visit to check your home for ways to prevent falls. Handrails, bedside commodes, grab bars, shower chairs, and other tools can help keep some patients from falling.\n \n  \n \n  If the patient falls\n  \n   \n    if they aren’t breathing, unless the patient is in hospice or has a Durable Power of Attorney for Health Care that states they do not wish to be revived.\n \n    if the patient is unconscious\n \n   if the patient is bleeding, or has fluid draining from the mouth, ears, or nose.\n \n   Let the patient stay where they’ve fallen until you can find out if there are serious injuries.\n \n   If you can’t move the patient, make them as comfortable as possible until help comes.\n \n   If the patient can answer you, ask if they have any pain.\n \n   Check the patient’s head, arms, legs, and buttocks for cuts and bruises, and look to see if anything looks strange or out of shape (possibly due to a broken bone).\n \n  \n  \n   \n   If the patient is not in pain and isn’t bleeding, help them back to a bed or chair. (If possible, get help moving the patient.)\n \n   Apply ice packs and pressure to any bleeding area. (Put ice in a plastic bag and wrap bag in a towel.)\n \n  \n \n  Call the cancer care team if the patient\n   \n \n  \n   \n \n   \n   Notices new weakness, numbness, or change in mental status (such as if the patient is confused, doesn’t know where they are, becomes forgetful, or isn’t making sense)\n \n   Gets weak or unsteady enough that a fall seems likely\n \n   Is concerned about possible injury from a fall\n"

        "text": "Blood Clots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n \n \n  \nWhat are blood clots?\n \n  Blood clotting is a normal body process. It is also called . When you get a cut or injury, your body sends blood cells called  plus other special proteins to the site of the injury and forms a clot. This kind of clot looks like a clump of dried blood and some people call it a scab. Unless the cut or injury is very big, the clot will clog up the area where the injury has happened.  This helps stop the bleeding so you don't lose too much blood. These kinds of blood clots are normal, stay in place as you heal, and then they will fall off or dissolve over time when they aren’t needed anymore.\n \n  Types of Blood Clots\n \n  Sometimes different types of blood clots are named by where they start or the parts of the body they affect: \n   \n \n   \n   Thrombus (single) or thrombi (more than one)\n \n   Thromboembolism: The name for a thrombus that has broken loose and stuck in another blood vessel, or in another part of the body such as the lungs or legs.\n \n   Deep vein thrombosis (or DVT): A blood clot in a deep vein, usually in the leg, and other times in the arm or other deep veins.\n \n   Pulmonary embolus (PE): A blood clot that has started somewhere else, but breaks loose and gets stuck in the lungs. This is a  serious, life-threatening condition.\n \n   Venous thromboembolism (VTE): A word used to describe both DVT and PE\n \n   Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC): a usually rare but serious condition that is a complication of some cancers, causing severe bleeding and severe clotting at the same time. DIC is life-threatening and should be treated immediately.\n \n  \n \n  Patients with cancer are at a higher risk of developing venous thromboembolism (VTE). Blood clots can be life-threatening, should be taken  seriously, and should be treated immediately.\n  \n  Blood clots in people with cancer\n   \n  Cancer itself can increase your risk of getting blood clots. Cancer is known to be a risk factor for having a deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Some experts suggest this is because of tissue damage some cancers can cause that might trigger the blood clotting process. \n \n  Any person with cancer can develop a blood clot. But certain kinds of cancer (for example, lung cancer or pancreatic cancer) , types of treatment, and other conditions and medications can increase the risk for blood clots. Having metastatic cancer (cancer that has spread from where it started to other areas of the body) increases the risk of having blood clots. \n \n  Other medical conditions have a higher risk for blood clots. If you already have a disorder that increases your risk, having cancer will increase that risk further. Some disorders that already have a risk for blood clots include Factor V Leiden thrombophilia, abnormally high levels of certain clotting proteins, abnormally low levels of proteins that prevent clots, and certain types of gene changes. In rare cases, cancer might be diagnosed by accident during testing when a person has a blood clot.\n \n  Blood clots from medications or treatments \n \n  There are some non-cancer medications that have a higher risk for blood clots, or that have a side effect that might cause blood clots. Some vitamins, minerals, and supplements might increase the risk for blood clots, too. It's very important to talk to your doctor about all medications, vitamins, minerals, and supplements you are taking so your risk can be discussed.\n \n  Medications given to treat cancer that are known to be linked with blood clots, or have side effects that contribute to clots are:\n \n   \n   Platinum, such as cisplatin\n \n   Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitors, such as bevacizumab\n \n   VEGF tyrosine kinase receptor inhibitors, such as sorafenib or sunitinib\n \n   L-asparaginase\n \n   Thalidomide\n \n   Lenalidomide\n \n   Tamoxifen\n \n  \n \n  Other risk factors for blood clots\n \n  Besides cancer and other health conditions, other things can put you at risk for getting blood clots, such as:\n \n   \n   Older age (being older than 65 puts you at greater risk)\n \n   Being pregnant\n \n   Smoking\n \n   Sitting or lying in bed for long periods of time or being in bed more than 3 days in a row\n \n   Taking birth control pills or other hormone therapy\n \n   Being overweight\n \n   Having surgery, especially orthopedic surgery, abdominal or pelvis surgery\n \n   Having a family history of blood clots\n \n   Having a central venous catheter in place\n \n   Having a blood transfusion or taking red blood-cell stimulating agents for some types of anemia\n \n   Having an infection.\n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n   \n  \n \n  Symptoms of blood clots: what to look for\n \n  Sometimes a blood clot has no symptoms, but it is important to   you have any of the symptoms listed here, because some blood clots can be dangerous and become life-threatening:\n \n   \n   Sudden chest pain\n \n   Sudden leg or arm pain\n \n   Swelling in the leg or arm\n \n   Fast heart rate\n \n   Shortness of breath\n \n   A feeling of overwhelming dread or doom\n \n   Sweating or fever\n \n   Coughing up blood.\n \n  \n \n  \n         \n  Finding and managing blood clots\n \n  Blood clots can be found after a patient reports symptoms that suggest a blood clot. Other times, blood clots are found by accident when checking for other things.\n \n  In patients without cancer, calculating the chance of getting a blood clot, and having a special blood test (called a D-Dimer test) can often be enough to rule out the presence of a blood clot.\n \n  In cancer patients, using these tests alone may not be as accurate and useful. Your health care team will get the information needed to decide if you will need one or more of them, plus additional tests, such as:\n \n   \n   Special blood tests\n \n   A CT scan or other imaging (x-ray) test to look for blood clots\n \n   A ultrasound scan (called a Doppler) to look for blood clots\n \n  \n \n  What can be done about a blood clot?\n \n  You and your doctor will decide what the best treatment for your blood clot is. Some of the treatments that you could have include one or more of the following.\n \n   \n   Medication that helps stop your blood from clotting more than normal (these medications are also called anticoagulants). Usually these are given intravenously (IV) drugs, but in some patients, these may be taken by mouth. Because these drugs help prevent clots, they have side effects that can cause bleeding. You and your doctor will weigh the benefits of the drugs against the risks of these side effects.\n \n   Medications that can dissolve clots (given by IV)\n \n   Filters that help stop a clot from traveling into your lungs or heart. These special filters are put into a large vein in your chest during a surgical procedure. \n \n  \n  \n  Can a blood clot be prevented?\n \n  If you are at higher risk of having a blood clot, have cancer, and are starting a certain type of cancer treatment, your doctor may give you medication to prevent a blood clot. Sometimes your doctor will decide that the risk of bleeding episodes associated with the drugs used to treat blood clots is worth the benefit of never getting a blood clot to begin with. In this case, you may be given medications to prevent a blood clot from happening. \n \n  If you are having certain surgeries, you might receive anticoagulation medication before, and for weeks after the surgery, to prevent blood clots. After surgery, you might also wear hose, a garment, or a device that helps to compress your legs or other area of your body. Some experts recommend cancer patients receive preventive medication for blood clots any time you are hospitalized or before, during, and for some days after you have surgery. For most patients, taking medications to prevent a blood clot if you are not in the hospital is not necessary. It is important, though, to be checked for your risk of having a blood clot every now and then.\n \n  Talk to your doctor about your risk and whether you need to take medications or use other therapies to prevent blood clots. It is also very important to notify your health care team if you think you have any of the symptoms associated with a blood clot. \n \n  What the patient can do \n \n  If you are concerned about your risk for blood clots, if you have been told you are at risk, or you are being treated for a blood clot, here are some questions to ask your doctor.\n \n   \n   Does having a blood clot put me at risk for having more in the future?\n \n   Is this a life-threatening blood clot?\n \n   What about my cancer or my treatment requires me to be on medicine when I don’t have a clot now?\n \n   What activities should I avoid while I am on this medicine?\n \n   How long do I have to be on this medicine?\n \n   What other side effects can I expect from this medicine?\n \n  \n \n  It's best to stay away from anti-inflammatory medicines, such as aspirin, naproxen, or ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil, Naprosyn, Aleve, Midol) and medicines like them unless your cancer care team tells you it's safe to use them. Check with your pharmacist if you’re not sure whether a medicine is an anti-inflammatory, or if it contains one of them. Do not take any over- the-counter medications such as aspirin or ibuprofen without talking to your doctor first. These , along with medication for blood clots, can thin your blood and make you bleed easily.\n \n  If you get medicine to prevent or to treat a blood clot, it is important to take care to not injure yourself, because your blood’s ability to clot will be slowed down. This means that even little injuries can cause you to bleed more than you usually would. Some things you can do to prevent little injuries include:\n \n   \n   Using an electric razor to shave, rather a straight razor\n \n   Using a soft toothbrush and brushing gently to avoid making your gums bleed\n \n   Do not use dental floss unless approved by your doctor\n \n   Avoid blowing your nose forcefully, to avoid a nosebleed\n \n   Avoid falls that could cause bruises; pick up loose throw rugs to avoid tripping\n \n   Eat a healthy diet that includes fiber to avoid constipation. If you get constipated, talk to your cancer care team about using a stool softener. Do not use enemas or suppositories of any kind \n \n   Keep your head level with or above your heart (lie flat or stay upright) \n \n  \n       \n  \n \n  Call for help right away if\n \n   \n   You notice any symptoms of a blood clot\n \n   You have unusual bleeding\n \n   Bleeding of any kind does not stop\n \n  \n \n  The sooner you get help, the more likely the treatment for a blood clot or clotting problem will be effective.\n"

This can cause discomfort.\n \n  You might become constipated because there is not enough fluid in your digestive system or not enough movement in your intestine (bowel or colon) where stool is formed and pushed through to be passed from the body. Certain people with cancer might have an increased risk for constipation if they have a tumor in the belly or pelvis or get  certain types of cancer treatment. Lack of activity,  changes in food intake, or poor fluid intake add to the problem. And people who take certain kinds of pain medicine, especially opioids, are more at risk of constipation. \n \n  What to look for\n \n   \n   Small, hard bowel movements (sometimes described as \"pellets\")\n \n   Leakage of soft, liquid stool that looks like diarrhea\n \n   Stomachache or cramps\n \n   Passing a lot of gas or frequent belching\n \n   Belly looks blown up or puffy\n \n   Not having regular bowel movements within the past 3 days (or some period of time your cancer care team might talk about before treatment starts)\n \n   \n \n  \n  \n  What the patient can do\n \n   \n   Ask your cancer care team to help you set up a daily bowel care plan. They might suggest over-the-counter products such as stool softeners or fiber supplements. \n \n   Try to eat at the same times each day. If possible, try to move your bowels at the same time every day. \n \n   Keep track of bowel movements so that problems can be noticed quickly.\n \n   If it's ok with your cancer care team, eat more high-fiber foods every day, such as whole-grain breads and cereals; fresh raw fruits with skins and seeds; fresh raw vegetables; fruit juices; and dates, apricots, raisins, prunes, prune juice, and nuts.\n \n   Drink more fluids. Pasteurized fruit juices and warm or hot fluids in the morning may be helpful.\n \n   Get as much exercise as possible.\n \n   Go to the bathroom as soon there is an urge.\n \n   \n    Avoid foods and drinks that cause gas, such as apples, avocados, beans and peas, cabbage, broccoli, milk, and fizzy drinks, until the constipation is gone.\n \n   Avoid chewing gum and using straws to drink. Using them can also cause gas.\n \n   Avoid or cut back on any foods that may cause constipation, such as cheese or eggs..\n \n   Do not use enemas or suppositories. Always ask your cancer team before using stool softeners or laxatives.\n \n   If your cancer care team gives you a prescription medicine, follow the directions carefully. \n \n  \n \n  What caregivers can do\n \n   \n   Encourage extra fluids: offer prune juice, hot water with lemon, coffee, or tea to help make bowels move.\n \n   Help keep a record of bowel movements.\n \n   Encourage the patients to be more active, even in small ways. Go with them on walks or to do other exercise. \n \n  \n \n  Call the cancer care team if the patient\n   \n \n   \n   Has not had a bowel movement in 3 days (or a certain period of time your cancer care team might talk about before treatment starts).\n \n   Has blood in or around the anal area or blood in the stool.\n \n   Hasn’t moved bowels in 1 or 2 days after taking a softener or laxative.\n \n   Has belly cramps or vomiting that doesn’t stop.\n \n   Develops loose or watery stools. \n"

Certain types and locations of tumors, certain medications, being dehydrated, or having constipation can also cause urinary retention.\n \n  Symptoms of urine retention\n \n  Urine retention can be uncomfortable and symptoms might include:\n \n   \n   Pain and bloating in the lower abdominal (belly) area.\n \n   A frequent, urgent need to urinate but then having trouble doing it. \n \n  \n \n  It's important to be checked if you have symptoms because urine that stays in your bladder for longer than it's supposed to could grow bacteria (become infected).\n \n  If your cancer care team thinks you might have urinary retention, they will order tests. Some of these tests include bladder ultrasound, cystoscopy, CT scans, urodynamic tests (measure urine output in different ways), or electromyography (an outpatient procedure that uses electric sensors to measure muscle and nerve activity around the bladder).\n \n  Managing urine retention\n \n  There are different ways to manage urine retention.  Common ways include surgery to repair or strengthen the bladder, using a bladder catheter to drain urine, dilating or widening the urethra (the duct that urine flows through when emptied) called having urethral dilation or stents, and giving certain medications.\n \n  Bladder drainage\n \n  Inserting a catheter in the bladder can help relieve bladder fullness and help prevent damage. Sometimes it's necessary for patients to learn how to manage bladder drainage by inserting a catheter on your own.  If using a catheter is needed, depending on the cause of the retention, it might be for a short or extended period of time. \n   It's important to follow instructions for inserting a catheter to help prevent infection. You'll also likely be taught to track how much fluid you're drinking and how to measure urine drainage (output).\n \n  Urethral dilation or stents\n \n  This might be done if there is an obstruction or stricture in the urethra where urine flows through to be emptied. Dilating means the urethra is widened, using a small catheter or tube. A stent is a small catheter or tube that is inserted and left in place. Dilating can be done on its own or when a stent is needed. This is typically done as an outpatient or during an office visit with local anesthesia. The stent may be temporary or permanent to help drain the bladder.\n \n  Medications\n \n  Certain drugs can be given to help relax the bladder muscles. In men, some medications also help relax prostate muscles to relieve urinary retention symptoms.\n \n  Surgery\n \n  If tumors are in or around the bladder, surgery may help reduce any obstruction to the urethra and decrease urinary retention symptoms. For certain problems in the urethra, a  uses incisions or a laser to open the stricture.\n \n  In some women, the tissue that supports the bladder and vagina areas can weaken and stretch, causing what's called a prolapse. A prolapse can be called a (between a woman's bladder and vaginal wall) or  (front wall of the rectum bulges against the posterior of the vagina) depending on the area affected.  \n    The prolapse can often be repaired which involves the area being surgically \"lifted.\" \n \n  Some men who have a non-cancerous condition called  might have surgery to remove excess tissue that is causing urinary blockage.\n \n  What the patient can do\n \n  Here are some things that may help make urine retention less of a problem:\n \n   \n   Empty your bladder at least every 4 hours, even if you don't feel the urge to do so.\n \n   Empty your bowels regularly.\n \n   Get regular physical activity.\n \n   If tolerated, drink 6 to 8 (8-ounce) glasses of fluid daily, preferably water.\n \n   Talk to your doctor about all medicines, vitamins, herbs, and supplements you’re taking.\n \n   Avoid drinks with caffeine or alcohol and citrus juices, which can irritate the bladder.\n \n   Avoid hygiene products (soaps, feminine sprays, bubble baths) and chlorinated pools and hot tubs that may irritate the bladder \n \n   Avoid smoking.\n",

Many things can cause confusion in cancer patients, including:\n \n   \n   Cancer that has spread into the brain\n \n   Cancer in the fluid around the brain\n \n   Certain cancer treatments such as chemotherapy drugs, radiation to the brain, surgery, or stem cell transplant.\n \n   Certain medications used along with cancer treatment such as opioids (strong pain medication), steroids, medications used to prevent or treat nausea or allergies, appetite stimulants, or sleep medications.\n \n   Lack of oxygen to the brain\n \n   \n \n   Electrolyte level changes such as high calcium, low magnesium, low phosphorous, or low sodium\n \n   Organ failure, such as liver or kidney failure\n \n   Intense pain\n \n   Low blood sugar\n \n   \n \n   High temperature (fever)\n   \n   \n  \n   \n \n   Too much pain medicine\n \n   Other medicines\n \n  \n \n  Confusion can start or get worse when the patient goes to a new place and may worsen at night (you might hear this referred to as sundowning). Usually the cause of the confusion can and should be treated.\n  \n  Delirium\n \n  Delirium is a mental state of severe confusion that usually happens suddenly. Most of the time, the cause of delirium can be treated. Other times, delirium may be permanent, such as toward the end of life because of problems like organ failure. Delirium can be caused by:\n \n   \n   The cancer itself. \n \n   Certain cancer treatments such as some chemotherapy drugs, radiation to the brain, surgery, or stem cell transplant.\n \n   Certain medications used with cancer treatment such as opioids (strong pain medication), steroids, medications used to prevent or treat nausea or allergies, appetite stimulants, or sleep medications. \n \n   Lack of oxygen to the brain\n \n   Anemia\n \n   Electrolyte level changes such as high calcium, low magnesium, low phosphorous, or low sodium \n \n   Organ failure, such as liver or kidney failure\n \n   Infection\n \n  \n \n  The three types of delirium are:\n \n   \n   : The patient may act tired or sleepy\n \n   : The patient may seem to be restless or agitated\n \n   : At different times, the patient may experience either hypoactive or hyperactive delirium \n \n  \n \n  Signs of confusion and delirium\n \n  If a patient becomes confused or you suspect delirium, call the cancer team right away. The patient may need to be seen quickly so the cause of the problem can be found and treated. Sometimes, the patient may need to be in the hospital until the problem is treated. During this time, it’s helpful for confused patients to have someone they know stay with them.

For example, put a picture of a toilet on the bathroom door and a picture of a flame over the stove.\n \n   Protect the patient from injury.\n \n   Help the patient with hand washing, going to the bathroom, bathing, and other daily activities that may be hard for them to do alone.\n \n   Check to see what the patient eats. (They may forget to eat, or may not be able to eat.)\n \n   Be sure that the patient takes the right medicines the right way.\n \n   Keep medicines out of reach between doses.\n \n   Talk to the cancer care team if you feel overwhelmed. They may have resources that may be able to help you and the patient.\n \n  \n \n  Call the cancer care team if the patient\n \n   \n   Becomes confused suddenly or confusion worsens\n \n   Has any sudden changes in their ability to do routine tasks or care for themselves\n \n   Becomes violent\n \n   Hurts themselves or someone else in some way\n",

        "text": "What is  Fatigue or Weakness?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n \n \n  \nFatigue and weakness are often used to describe the same thing. But they actually are different. \n \n  Weakness\n \n  Weakness is when strength is decreased and extra effort is needed to move a certain part of the body or the entire body. Weakness is due to loss of muscle strength. Weakness can be a big part of why cancer patients feel fatigue.\n \n  Fatigue\n \n  Fatigue is an extreme feeling of tiredness or lack of energy, often described as being exhausted. Fatigue is something that lasts even when a person seems to be getting enough sleep. It can have many causes, including working too much, having disturbed sleep, stress and worry, not having enough physical activity, and going through an illness and its treatment. \n \n  The fatigue that often comes with cancer is called . It's very common. Between 80% and 100% of people with cancer report having fatigue. The fatigue felt by people with cancer is different from the fatigue of daily life and different from the tired feeling people might remember having before they had cancer.\n \n  People with cancer might describe it as feeling very weak, listless, drained, or “washed out” that may decrease for a while but then comes back. Some may feel too tired to eat, walk to the bathroom, or even use the TV remote. It can be hard to think or move. Rest might help for a short time but does not make it go away, and just a little activity can be exhausting. For some people with cancer, this kind of fatigue causes more distress than pain, nausea, vomiting, or depression.\n                        \n  What causes fatigue and weakness\n   ?\n \n   \n  \n \n  In people with cancer, weakness might be caused by having and recovering from surgery, low blood counts or low electrolyte (blood chemistry) levels, infection, or changes in hormone levels. \n \n  However, the causes of cancer-related fatigue are often harder to determine because there are often many factors involved. It might be from the cancer itself and/or a side effect of the cancer treatment. How cancer and treatment might cause fatigue is not well understood, but some possible reasons are:\n \n   \n   Cancer and cancer treatment can change normal protein and hormone levels that are linked to inflammatory processes which can cause or worsen fatigue.\n \n   Treatments kill normal cells and cancer cells, which leads to a build-up of cell waste. Your body uses extra energy to clean up and repair damaged tissue.\n \n   Cancer forms toxic substances in the body that change the way normal cells work. \n \n  \n \n  Besides direct effects of cancer and its treatment, people with cancer often also experience other things that can add together to increase fatigue. These are things like surgery, stress and worry, changes in activity level, and changes in blood counts, electrolytes, and hormone levels.\n \n  How long does fatigue or weakness last?\n \n  Fatigue that is due to cancer and its treatment can last for weeks, months, or years. It often continues after treatment ends.\n \n   \n   For people who have surgery for cancer with no other treatment, fatigue often decreases or goes away over time as they recover from surgery. \n \n   For people getting chemotherapy, targeted therapy, or immunotherapy in cycles, fatigue often gets worse at first and may get better until the next treatment, when the pattern starts again.\n \n   For those getting radiation therapy, fatigue usually gets worse as the treatment goes on and often lessens within a few months after treatment is complete.\n \n  \n \n  Fatigue can:\n \n   \n   Differ from one day to the next in how bad it is and how much it bothers you\n \n   Be overwhelming and make it hard for you to feel well\n \n   Make it hard for you to be with your friends and family\n \n   Make it hard for you to do things you normally do, including going to work\n \n   Make it harder for you to follow your cancer treatment plan.\n \n  \n \n  What to look for\n \n   \n   You feel tired and it doesn’t get better with rest or sleep, it keeps coming back, or it becomes severe.\n \n   You’re more tired than usual during or after an activity.\n \n   You’re feeling tired and it’s not related to an activity.\n \n   You’re too tired to do the things you normally do.\n \n   Your arms and legs feel heavy and hard to move.\n \n   You have no energy.\n \n   You feel very weak.\n \n   You spend more time in bed and/or sleep more. Or, you may have trouble sleeping.\n \n   You stay in bed for more than 24 hours.\n \n   You become confused or can’t concentrate or focus your thoughts.\n \n   Your tiredness disrupts your work, social life, or daily routine.\n \n  \n \n  It may be hard for you to talk about it, but tell your cancer care team about your fatigue. Tell them how it’s affecting your life. Someone on your team should be able to help you if they know you’re having this problem. Managing fatigue is part of good cancer care. Work with your cancer care team to find and treat the causes of your fatigue.\n"

        "text": "Managing Fatigue or Weakness\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n \n \n  \nFeeling weakness or fatigue is common in people with cancer, but it's different for each person. Feeling weak is often one part of having fatigue. It's important to remember that fatigue might get better after treatment ends for some, but last many months to years after treatment for others.\n \n  Describing and managing weakness\n \n  Weakness is decreased strength. If this is caused by surgery in a certain part of the body or loss of a body part, the weakness might be helped by physical therapy or occupational therapy. If weakness is caused by having an infection or having changes in blood levels, such as low blood counts, low electrolytes, or changes in hormones, treatment to help with the specific problem can help decrease weakness. \n   \n  Describing fatigue\n  \n  Fatigue can have many causes. People with cancer describe fatigue in many ways. They may say they feel tired, weak, exhausted, weary, worn-out, or slow. They may say they have no energy and can’t concentrate. They also talk about having heavy arms and legs, little drive to do anything, being unable to sleep or sleeping too much. They may feel moody, sad, irritable, or frustrated.\n \n  No lab tests or x-rays can diagnose or show your level of fatigue. The best measure of fatigue comes from the way you describe your fatigue level to your cancer care team. You can describe your level of fatigue as none, mild, moderate, or severe. Or you can use a scale of 0 to 10, where 0 means no fatigue at all, and 10 means the worst fatigue you can imagine. Ask your doctor or nurse how to describe your fatigue so they can understand how it affects your everyday life.\n \n  If you have moderate (4 to 6 on the 0 to 10 scale) to severe (7 to 10 on the 0 to 10 scale) fatigue, your doctor could ask you for more information. You might be asked questions like:\n \n   \n   When did the fatigue first start?\n \n   When did you first notice that this fatigue is different?\n \n   How long has it lasted?\n \n   Does anything make it better? Worse?\n \n   Are there times of day that you notice it more?\n \n   How has the fatigue affected the things you do every day or the activities that give meaning and enjoyment to your life?\n \n  \n \n  Is it fatigue or depression? \n \n  Some signs of fatigue or weakness often look a lot like those of depression, and it’s easy to confuse the two. Depression involves an inability to feel pleasure – people who are depressed feel sad or unworthy. They may give up hope. You can have fatigue and not be depressed, although some people have both fatigue and depression.\n \n  Sometimes it may be hard to find a label for what you’re feeling. Your doctor might want you to see a mental health professional to get another opinion on whether depression is part of the problem. If it is, treatment can help.\n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  Managing fatigue\n \n  Because the symptoms of fatigue in people with cancer are usually caused by more than one problem, doctors, nurses, social workers, physical therapists, pharmacists, dietitians and nutritionists, and a number of others might be involved in treating your fatigue or weakness. These symptoms often are caused by more than one problem. \n \n  Treating different specific cancer-related problems, like anemia or pain, might make you feel better, but other things may need to be done, too. For this reason your cancer care team might have you try many different things to help manage your fatigue or work with a palliative care team to address multiple symptoms.\n \n  There’s no way to know if you'll have fatigue, how bad it will be, or how long it will last. In some cases, it can be hard for the doctor to figure out exactly what’s causing your fatigue. Still, there are things you can do to help manage it.\n  \n  Different activities and therapies \n \n  Exercise, yoga, massage therapy, counseling, and dietary or nutritional counseling are all used to help treat fatigue and weakness.\n \n  If you’re having problems sleeping or sleeping too much, your doctor or nurse may suggest sleep therapy. This therapy can help you minimize sleep disturbances and learn improved sleep hygiene.\n \n  More research is needed and is being done in this area, but there are stimulant drugs your health care team may prescribe you if your fatigue doesn't improve. These stimulants are only prescribed for a short period. It's important you talk to your doctor about the benefits of taking these drugs, as well as the different side effects that may occur such as daytime sleepiness, withdrawal symptoms, insomnia, memory problems, or allergic reactions.\n \n  Exercise and yoga\n \n  Research studies have shown that physical activity during and after cancer treatment can decrease fatigue. Your health care team can refer you to exercise specialists (physical therapist, physical medicine, rehabilitation specialist) to help you with a safe exercise plan that can be modified to your condition. Yoga has helped improve sleep for some people with different types of cancer who are going through treatment. \n \n   :\n \n   \n   Cancer that has spread to your bones (bone metastasis)\n \n   A low white blood cell count\n \n   A low platelet count\n \n   A fever or active infection\n \n   Anemia (low red blood cell counts)\n \n   Unsteadiness, frailty, or other problem that might make exercise unsafe for you\n \n  \n \n  \n \n  Massage therapy\n \n  Massage therapy has helped some patients during cancer treatment by possibly reducing stress levels and improving sleep. Talk to your doctor first before starting massage therapy.\n \n  Counseling\n \n  Behavioral therapy or mindfulness-based stress reduction has helped cancer survivors reduce fatigue. Sharing your feelings with others can help ease the burden of fatigue. You can also learn coping hints from others by talking about your situation. Ask your health care team to put you in touch with a support group. Or contact us to find a group near you.\n \n  Mental health counseling, stress management training, and relaxation exercises are some ways you can learn to improve the feelings related to fatigue and help overcome the tiredness you feel.\n \n  Studies have shown some breast cancer survivors reported lower distress\n    and fatigue with counseling and behavioral therapy.\n \n  Nutritional counseling\n \n  Nutritional deficits can add to the problems of fatigue and weakness. Your health care team may refer you to a dietitian to check your calorie and nutritional intake. You may be prescribed vitamins or supplemental electrolytes (sodium, potassium, calcium, iron, or magnesium) to help reduce your symptoms. Cancer patients, who may be managing other side effects (nausea, vomiting, bowel problems, mouth sores\n   ) or different medical conditions that affect eating, can benefit from this counseling.\n \n  What the patient can do\n   \n \n   \n   Rest, but not too much. Plan your day so you have time to rest.  (30 minutes or less), rather than one long nap during the day. Too much rest can lower your energy level and make it harder to sleep at night.\n \n   Certain drugs used to treat pain, nausea, or depression can make a person feel tired and sleepy. Talk with your cancer care team about this. Sometimes adjusting the doses or changing to a different drug can help.\n \n   Talk to your health care team about any problems with your nutritional intake\n \n   Regular moderate exercise – especially walking – is a good way to ease fatigue. Talk to your doctor about the right exercise plan for you.\n \n   Ask your family or friends to help with the things you find tiring or too hard to do.\n \n   Try to . Sleep experts tell us that having regular times to go to bed and get up helps us keep a healthy sleep routine.\n \n   Each day, prioritize – decide which things are most important to you and focus on those tasks. Then plan ahead. Spread activities throughout the day and take breaks. Do things slowly, so that you won’t use too much energy at once\n \n   \n \n    too late in the evening.\n \n  \n \n  What caregivers can do\n \n   \n   Help schedule friends and family members to prepare meals, clean the house, do yard work, or run errands for the patient. You can use websites that help organize these things, or ask a family member to look into this for you.\n \n   Try not to push the patient to do more than they are able to.\n \n   Help the patient set up a routine for activities during the day.\n \n  \n \n  Call the cancer care team if\n \n   \n   You feel too tired to get out of bed for a 24-hour period\n \n   You feel confused, dizzy, lose your balance or fall\n \n   You have problems waking up\n \n   You have problems catching your breath\n \n   The fatigue seems to be getting worse.\n \n  \n \n  "

        "text": "How Cancer and Cancer Treatment Can Affect Sexuality\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n \n \n  \nWhat is sexuality?\n \n  Sexuality refers to how people express themselves in a sexual way. It includes how they see, feel, and think about themselves as a sexual being, and the ways they show it through their actions, behaviors, and relationships. It's very personal and is different for everyone. Sexuality is sometimes called . \n \n  The ways a person shows sexuality or sexual intimacy isn't just through the sex act. Other ways include holding hands, giving special looks, hugging, kissing, clothing they wear, ways they walk and move, etc. A person's sexuality and how they show it can be affected by many things, such as their age, gender or gender identity, partner status, social status, self-esteem, upbringing, emotions and mood changes, and religious and cultural beliefs. It can also be affected by their overall health, and sometimes health problems affect well-being, body image, sexual function, and emotional health. Having sexual problems can sometimes be called .\n \n  It's important to know that sexuality is not about a person's gender. \n \n   \n    is part of sexuality and describes how a person is attracted to another person, such as if they are straight, gay, lesbian, or bisexual. \n \n    is the gender a person senses or feels they are (not necessarily the one assigned at birth).\n \n  \n \n  Sexuality and cancer\n \n  Sex, sexuality, and intimacy are just as important for people with cancer as they are for people who don’t have cancer. In fact, sexuality and intimacy have been shown to help people face cancer by helping them deal with feelings of distress, and when going through treatment. But, the reality is that a person's sex organs, sexual desire (sex drive or libido), sexual function, well-being, and body image can be affected by cancer and cancer treatment. How a person shows sexuality can also be affected. \n  \n  Sexual problems often develop because of physical and psychological side effects of cancer and cancer treatments. Some surgeries and treatments might have very little effect on a person's sexuality, sexual desire, and sexual function. Others can affect how a certain body part works, change hormone levels, or damage nerve function that can cause changes in a person's sexual function. Certain types of treatments have side effects such as fatigue, nausea, bowel or bladder problems, pain, and skin problems or other changes in appearance that might cause problems with sexuality. Some sexual problems get better or go away over time, but some are long-lasting and can be lifelong. \n \n   \n \n  Talking about sexuality when you have cancer\n \n  For patients\n \n  It’s very important to talk with your cancer care team about what to expect, and to continue to talk about what's changing or has changed in your sexual life as you go through procedures, treatments, and follow-up care. This includes letting them know any over-the-counter and prescription medications, vitamins, or supplements you may be taking because they might interfere with treatments. \n \n     Many studies have found that doctors, nurses, and other members of a health care team don’t always ask about sexuality during check-ups and treatment visits. Because of this, patients might not get enough information, support, or resources to help them deal with their feelings and sexual problems. \n \n  Studies also show that many doctors and nurses don't know the right questions to ask about sexual orientation and gender identity. Many are not familiar with different terms that describe if a person is lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender (LGBT), or gender non-conforming (GNC). It's very important to let your cancer care team know your sexual orientation and gender identity, including what gender you were at birth and how you describe yourself now. \n \n  If you are a transgender male or female, you'll need to give them a list of any procedures you may have had or any hormones or other medications you have taken or are taking for your transition. Letting your cancer care team know this information will help you get the personalized care you need. \n \n  Be as honest and open as possible, and ask questions so your cancer care team can help and so you get the right answers.  While you might feel embarrassed, remember your cancer care team must keep the information you tell them confidential. And, once a conversation is started, it's easier to continue it and to bring it up again during your future check-ups.\n \n  Most importantly, talk with your partner. Remember that warmth, caring, and physical and emotional closeness are as necessary and rewarding as anything else in your relationship. If you both feel comfortable, it might be a good idea to include your partner when talking with your health care team, too. \n \n  Talking to others, such as friends, family members, and other cancer survivors can be helpful. But, it's important to remember that everyone is different, and one person's experience can be very different from yours. Not everyone's cancer or treatment will affect them in the same way. Different types of cancer and treatments have different side effects, and how a body reacts can be better or worse depending on other health problems, too.\n \n  Your doctor may refer you to a sex educator, counselor, or therapist to help you deal with some fears and worries about the effects of cancer, or to a professional who might be able to help with physical problems that are interfering with sexuality or sexual function.\n \n  For caregivers and partners\n \n   \n    Studies have shown that patients report a better quality of life and feel more attractive when they have a supportive partner or caregiver they can trust with intimate details. Being able to talk about their emotional issues and sexual problems with a partner can also help to reassure the patient. For example, caregivers and partners might be able to help the patient recognize problems with self-esteem, sexual desire, and sexual function so they can be openly talked about and effectively managed. They can help track side effects, too, which can sometimes affect a patient's sexuality. Open communication with a partner can help a patient cope and feel more comfortable asking for help. \n \n  Depending on the type of problem, going with the patient to treatment and follow-up visits and check-ups might be a good idea, too. If you go, be prepared to write down important information, or ask if you can record the visit. \n  \n  Before surgery or treatment\n \n   Before surgery and other treatments, patients and their partners need to know about possible changes that might affect a certain body part, or their sex organs, sexuality, and sexual function. Having these talks in advance can help know what to expect. But, studies show that not many cancer patients remember being told about sexual risks before surgery or treatment. Asking questions and getting honest answers can open up the opportunity for follow-up talks that lead to making informed decisions about care through the entire cancer journey.  \n \n  ﻿During treatment \n \n \n  You may have concerns about intimacy and sexual activity during treatment, or may notice changes. It's important to keep talking to your health care team as you move into the treatment phase. Or, if you didn't talk about sexuality before surgery or treatment, you can start talking about it during treatment-related visits, even if your doctor or nurse don't bring it up. Include your partner, if you're comfortable doing so. Remember, if your health care team doesn't know about a problem you're having, they can't help you manage it. \n \n  ﻿After treatment \n \n  People who have finished cancer treatment may have lingering problems with sexuality, and some of them might be lifelong. These can affect relationships, too. Be sure to continue reporting problems, and asking questions during follow-up visits. If you are no longer being seen by a cancer care team, be sure those providing health care for you are aware of problems you've had, what has helped or not helped, and other problems that might come up. \n \n  Palliative care \n \n  Palliative care can help address sexuality and other quality of life concerns. Ask members of the palliative care team to help manage sexual problems. This team of professionals can help manage symptoms at any time from the point of diagnosis, throughout treatment, and beyond for people living with a serious illness, such as cancer. \n \n  End-of life\n \n  Sexuality continues to be important for many people with advanced cancer, and for those whose treatment has stopped working. It's important to keep talking about sexuality and sexual problems with the health care team that's managing end-of-life care.\n"

        "text": "Cancer, Sex, and the Female Body\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n \n  \n  \nWhen a person is diagnosed with cancer, they may wonder how ‘normal’ life can and will be if they need to go through surgery or treatment, or as they adjust to living as a survivor. Many times a person with cancer wonders how the diagnosis and treatment might affect their sex life.\n  \n  \n     \n  Sex, sexuality, andintimacy are just as important for people with cancer as they are for people who don’t have cancer. In fact, sexuality and intimacy have been shown to help people face cancer by helping them deal with feelings of distress, and when going through treatment. But, the reality is that a person's sex organs, sexual desire (sex drive or libido), sexual function, well-being, and body image can be affected by having cancer and cancer treatment. How a person shows sexuality can also be affected. Read more in How Cancer and Cancer Treatment Can Affect Sexuality.\n  \n  The information here is for adult females who want to learn more about how cancer and cancer treatment can affect their sex life. We cannot answer every question, but we’ll try to give you enough information for you and your partner to have open, honest talks about intimacy and sex. We’ll also share some ideas to help you talk with your doctor and your cancer care team.\n \n  , you may have needs that are not addressed here. It's very important to talk to your cancer care team and give them information about your sexual orientation and gender identity, including what gender you were at birth, how you describe yourself now, any procedures you’ve had done, or hormone treatments you may have taken or are taking. \n \n  The 1st step: good communication\n \n  It’s important to know that you can get answers to these questions and help if you are having sexual problems. It’s very important to talk with your cancer care team about what to expect, and continue to talk about what's changing or has changed in your sexual life as you go through procedures, treatments, and follow-up care. This includes letting them know what over-the-counter and prescription medications, vitamins, or supplements you may be taking because they might interfere with treatments. \n \n   Many studies have found that doctors, nurses, and other members of a health care team don’t always ask about sexuality, sexual orientation, or gender identity during check-ups and treatment visits. Because of this, patients might not get enough information, support, or resources to help them deal with their feelings and sexual problems. \n \n  Questions to ask\n \n  You probably have certain questions and things you're wondering about. Here are some questions you may want to ask your doctor or nurse  to jump start talks about having sex during and after treatment:\n \n   \n   How might treatment affect my sex life?\n \n   Is it safe to have sex now? If not, when will it be OK to have sex?\n \n   Are there any types of sex I should avoid?\n \n   Do I need birth control or other protection during treatment? How about afterwards? For how long?\n \n   Can my medications or treatment be passed to my partner through my body fluids?\n \n   What safety measures do I need to take, and for how long?\n \n  \n \n  The 2nd step: Understanding how your body works\n \n  Understanding the female sex organs\n \n  A woman’s genitals and organs for pregnancy are in the pelvis (the lower part of the belly). These are some organs that are in the pelvis, including sex organs and other nearby organs. :\n \n   \n    – the pear-shaped organ that holds a growing baby\n \n    – 2 thin tubes that carry eggs from the ovaries to the uterus\n \n    – 2 small organs that store eggs and make hormones\n \n    – the lower part of the uterus at the top of the vagina\n \n    – a 3- to 4-inch tube that connects the cervix to the outside of the body\n \n    – the outside parts, such as the clitoris and the inner and outer lips\n \n    – the hollow, balloon-like organ that holds urine\n \n    – the bottom end of the intestines that connects to the outside of the body\n \n  \n \n \n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n \n \n  \n \n  Many women have never looked at their genitals, and may not know for sure which parts are where.\n \n  If you feel comfortable doing so, take a few minutes with a hand mirror to examine yourself.\n \n   \n   The outside part is called the vulva.\n \n   Find the outer lips (labia majora) and inner lips (labia minora). They act like pillows to protect the sensitive parts in the middle. Many women find that gentle touch on the inner lips feels good.\n \n   Next find the clitoris, a small bump covered by a little hood of skin. It’s right in the middle, above the opening of the vagina. The clitoris is the part of a woman’s body most sensitive to pleasure with caressing.\n \n   Just under the clitoris is a little slit where urine comes out. This is the opening of a short tube (the urethra) which drains the bladder (storage bag for urine).\n \n   Below the opening of the vagina is the anus, where stool come out. The anus is the very end of the system that digests food. Some women enjoy being touched around and even inside the anus. If you or a partner puts a finger or a sex toy in the anus, do not use it to caress the vagina, since that could cause an infection with bacteria that are healthy in the anus, but not in the vagina.\n \n  \n \n  You may also want to try touching each area lightly to find out where you are most sensitive.\n \n  Has your cancer treatment changed the look of your outer genitals in any way? If so, take time to get used to the changes. Check to see if any areas are sore or tender. Share what you learn about yourself with your partner. Work together to have sex that pleases you both.\n \n  The natural cycles of the mature female body\n \n  In order to talk about sex, it helps to know about the structures and hormones that are also involved with having children and how they work together.\n \n  During the years when a woman can have children, her ovaries take turns each month producing a ripe egg. When the egg is released, it travels through the fallopian tube into the uterus. A woman can get pregnant (naturally) if a sperm cell travels through the cervix and joins the egg. The cervix is the gateway for sperm to get into the body and for a baby passing out of the body at birth.\n \n  If a woman does not become pregnant, the lining of the uterus that has built up over the past weeks flows out of her cervix as the “blood” of her period. If she gets pregnant, the lining stays in place to feed the growing baby.\n \n  \n \n  Hormones\n \n  The main hormones that may help a woman feel desire are called  \nand . Androgens are thought of as “male” hormones, but women’s bodies also make small amounts of them. About half of the androgens in women are made in the adrenal glands that sit on top of the kidneys. The ovaries make the rest of a woman’s androgens. Estrogen comes mostly from the ovaries.\n \n  The ovaries usually stop sending out eggs and greatly reduce their hormone output around age 50, though the age varies. This is called  or “the change of life.” Some women fear that their sexual desire will go away with menopause. But for many women, the drop in ovarian hormones doesn’t change their desire for sex. Still, it can take longer for the vagina to enlarge and get moist. Low estrogen levels can also cause the lining of the vagina to get thinner and lose some of its ability to stretch. In some women, the vagina may stay tight and dry, even if they are very aroused.\n \n  Female orgasm\n \n  As a woman becomes sexually excited, her nervous system sends signals of pleasure to her brain. The signals may trigger the orgasm reflex. During orgasm, the muscles around the genitals contract in rhythm. The muscle tension and release sends waves of pleasure through the genital area and sometimes over the entire body. \n \n  A woman’s orgasms may change over time. As she gets older, orgasms may take longer to reach, and more mental excitement and touching may be needed.\n \n  There are many sources of excitement that lead to orgasm. They differ for each woman. A few women can reach orgasm just by having a vivid fantasy about sex or by having their breasts stroked. Others have had an orgasm during a dream while asleep. But most women need some caressing of their genitals to reach orgasm.\n \n  The areas of a woman’s genitals that are most sensitive to touch are the clitoris and the inner lips. When a woman becomes sexually excited, the entire genital area swells. It also turns a darker pink as blood rushes in under the skin.\n \n  Many women reach orgasm most easily when the clitoris is stroked. Like a penis, the clitoris has a head and a shaft. It sends messages of pleasure to the brain when it’s stroked.\n \n  The head of the clitoris is so sensitive that it can become sore from direct rubbing that’s either too fast or too hard. Soreness can be prevented by using a lubricant and by stroking or touching close to, but not on, the head of the clitoris.\n \n  Other areas, including the outer lips and anus, can also give a woman pleasure when stroked. Each woman’s sensitive zones are a little different. The opening of the vagina contains many nerve endings. It’s more sensitive to light touch than the deep end of the vagina. For some women, the front wall of the vagina is more sensitive to pressure during sex than the back wall.  Some sex therapists suggest that stroking an area about 1 to 4 inches deep on the front wall of the vagina helps some women reach orgasm during sex.\n \n  The 3rd step: Keep talking and work together to manage problems\n  \n         \n  \n \n   \n  \n  \n   Talk with your doctor, nurse, or any other member of your cancer care team. When you know what to expect, you can plan how you might handle those issues.\n \n   Few cancer treatments (other than those affecting some areas of the brain or spinal cord) damage the nerves and muscles involved in feeling pleasure from touch and reaching orgasm. For example, a woman whose vagina is painfully tight or dry can often reach orgasm through stroking of her breasts and outer genitals.\n \n   \nSome couples have a narrow view of what normal sex is. If both partners cannot reach orgasm through or during penetration, some may feel disappointed. But during and after cancer treatment, there may be times when the kind of sex you like best is not possible. Those times can be a chance to learn new ways to give and receive sexual pleasure. You and your partner can help each other reach orgasm through touching and stroking. At times, just cuddling can be pleasurable. You could also continue to enjoy touching yourself. Do not stop sexual pleasure just because your usual routine has been changed.\n \n  If you’re too embarrassed to ask your team whether sexual activity is OK, you may never find out. Talk to your team about sex, and tell your partner what you learn. Good communication is the key to adjusting your sexual routine when cancer changes your body. If you feel weak or tired and want your partner to take a more active role in touching you, say so. If some part of your body is tender or sore, you can guide your partner’s touches to avoid pain. Keep in mind that if one partner has a sex problem, it affects both of you.\n \n   Remind yourself about your good qualities. If you lose your hair, you may choose to wear a wig, hat, or scarf if it makes you feel more comfortable. You may choose to wear a breast form (prosthesis) if you’ve had a breast removed. Do whatever makes you feel good about yourself. Eating right and exercising can also help keep your body strong and your spirits up. Practice relaxation techniques, and get professional help if you think you are anxious, depressed, or struggling.\n"

        "text": "How Surgery Can Affect the Sex Life of Females with Cancer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n \n \n  \nSex is an important part of being in a relationship, but certain types of surgery can cause sexual problems to develop. Managing these issues might involve several different therapies, treatments, or devices, or a combination of them. Counseling can also be helpful.\n \n  The information below describes common sexual problems an adult female having certain types of cancer surgery may experience. You can find out about the effects of hormone therapy on specific types of cancers in Cancer A to Z.\n \n    please talk to your cancer care team about any needs that are not addressed here.\n \n  Ask questions\n \n  It’s very important to talk about what to expect, and continue to talk about what's changing or has changed in your sexual life as you go through procedures, treatments, and follow-up care.  Remember, if they don't know about a problem you're having, they can't help you manage it.\n  \n  How pelvic surgery cancer can affect sex\n \n  Many different organs may be affected in pelvic surgery for cancer.  Here are some of the more common types of surgery used to treat certain cancers and the ways they can impact your sex life.\n \n  Radical hysterectomy\n \n  Radical hysterectomy is done to treat some cancers of the cervix and some cancers of the endometrium (uterus) that have spread to the cervix. The surgeon takes out the uterus and the ligaments (tissue fibers) that hold it in place. The cervix and an inch or 2 of the vagina around the cervix are also removed. A hysterectomy done to treat uterine or ovarian cancer removes less tissue.\n \n  After taking out the cervix, the surgeon stitches the vagina at its top. Some fluid drains from the vagina during healing. The top of the vagina soon seals with scar tissue and becomes a closed tube. The vagina does not, as some women fear, become an open tunnel into the pelvis.\n \n  The ovaries may or may not be removed.\n \n  Depending on a woman's age, stage of life, and preferences, the surgeon might leave an ovary or part of one during a hysterectomy. For women who have not yet started menopause, leaving even one ovary can produce enough hormones to help prevent early menopause. Because the uterus is removed, a woman will not have menstrual periods and she will not be able to carry a pregnancy.\n \n  The cancer care team can help weigh the risks and benefits of removing one or both ovaries. \n  \n  Effects of hysterectomy on bladder function\n \n  A radical hysterectomy procedure can affect a woman’s ability to pass urine while the nerves in the tissue around the uterus are healing after surgery. Some doctors may leave a catheter in the bladder for a few days after surgery to reduce urinary problems. In some cases, there can be long-term effects on bladder function, and different options can be offered to help manage this.\n  \n  Effects of hysterectomy on sexual function\n \n  Hysterectomy shortens the vagina and may cause numbness in the genital area.  This can affect a woman's sex life.\n \n  In some cases, cancer causes pain or bleeding with vaginal sex. A hysterectomy can help stop those symptoms, and a woman’s sex life may improve after the surgery. The vagina might be shorter after surgery, and it's important for the vagina to have moisture to allow the tissues to stretch and move.\n    \n  Sex problems are likely to be somewhat worse and last longer for women who have pelvic radiation along with radical hysterectomy. See Pelvic Radiation Can Affect a Woman's Sex Life for more on this.\n \n  Radical cystectomy\n \n  A radical cystectomy is done to treat some bladder cancers. The surgeon removes the bladder, uterus, ovaries, fallopian tubes, cervix, front wall of the vagina, and the urethra.\n \n   This surgery tends to affect a woman's sex life, but sometimes things can be done during surgery to help preserve female sexual function (see below).\n \n  Changes in the vagina after radical cystectomy\n \n  Radical cystectomy often removes half of the vagina, but penetration is still possible. Surgeons sometimes rebuild the vagina with a skin graft. More commonly, they use the remaining back wall of the vagina to rebuild the vaginal tube. There are pros and cons with both types of vaginal reconstruction.\n \n  If your vagina is shorter because it hasn’t been reconstructed, you may still enjoy sexual activity. Certain sexual positions, like those where the partners are side by side or with you on top, limit the depth of penetration.\n \n  Orgasm after radical cystectomy\n \n  Many women who have had the front wall of the vagina removed as part of a cystectomy say that this has little or no effect on their orgasms. But others say that they were less able to have orgasms. There are 2 nerve bundles that run along each side of the vagina, and it’s easy to damage them when removing the front of the vagina. Talk with your doctor about the surgery that’s planned and whether these nerves can be spared (left in place) during surgery. If so, this can help increase your chance of having orgasms after surgery.\n \n  Another possible problem that can happen during radical cystectomy is that the surgeon takes out the end of the urethra where it opens outside the body. This can make the clitoris lose a good deal of its blood supply and may affect some parts of sexual arousal. (Remember that, like the penis, the clitoris fills with blood when a woman is excited.) Talk with your surgeon about whether the end of the urethra can be spared, and how that may affect your clitoral function. It’s not always necessary to remove the end of the urethra as part of surgery for bladder cancer. \n \n  Urostomy\n \n  People who have had a radical cystectomy will also have an ostomy or need reconstructive surgery. This is an opening on the abdomen (belly) where waste can pass out of the body. This type of ostomy is called a urostomy.\n It’s the way for urine to get out of the body after the bladder is removed. The urine flows through the urostomy into a plastic pouch glued to the skin around the ostomy. Some people now have continent \nostomies that stay dry and are emptied with a catheter. There is also a way to send urine back into your urethra by creating a new bladder from a piece of intestine (called a ). \n \n  For more about these reconstructive methods, see Bladder Cancer Surgery.  \n \n  Abdominoperineal resection\n \n  Abdominoperineal (AP) resection is a type of surgery that may be used to treat colon cancer. The lower colon and rectum are removed, and a colostomy is made so that stool can pass out of the body. Sometimes the uterus, ovaries, and even the rear wall of the vagina must be removed, too. The remaining vaginal tube must then be repaired with skin grafts or with a flap made of skin and muscle. \n \n  AP resection does not damage the nerves that control the feeling in a woman’s genitals and does allow orgasm. Some women may notice vaginal dryness, especially if their ovaries were removed. If so, a water-based gel lubricant can help make vaginal sex more comfortable. \n \n  Sex in certain positions may be uncomfortable or even painful. Without a rectum, the vagina becomes scarred. You may need to try different positions to find one that works.\n \n  For suggestions on how to manage an ostomy during sex, see Urostomy, colostomy, or ileostomy in Managing Female Sexual Problems Related to Cancer.\n \n  Vulvectomy (removing the vulva)\n \n  Cancer of the vulva is sometimes treated by removing all or part of the vulva. This operation is called a vulvectomy.\n \n   \n   A  vulvectomy removes only the cancer and an edge of normal tissue around that affected area.\n \n   A  vulvectomy removes the entire vulva and tissue under the skin.\n \n   The  vulvectomy removes the cancer and an edge of normal tissue, as well as some of the lymph nodes in the groin. If there’s cancer in or very near the clitoris, it may need to be removed to be sure all the cancer is taken out.\n \n   The most extensive surgery is called a  vulvectomy, which is rarely ever done. In this case, the surgeon removes the whole vulva and deep tissues. This includes the inner and outer lips, the clitoris, and often the lymph nodes that drain the vulva. The vagina, uterus, and ovaries remain.\n \n  \n \n  After part or all of the vulva has been removed, women often feel discomfort if they wear tight slacks or jeans because the “padding” around the urethral opening and vaginal entrance is gone. The area around the vagina also looks very different.\n \n  Women often fear their partners may be turned off by the scarring and loss of outer genitals, especially if they enjoy oral stimulation as part of sex. Some women may be able to have reconstructive surgery to rebuild the outer and inner lips of the genitals. It may help with the way the vulva looks, but the feeling (sensation) will be different.\n \n  When touching the area around the vagina, and especially the urethra, a light caress and the use of a lubricant can help prevent painful irritation. The area around the scar may be numb. If scar tissue narrows the entrance to the vagina, penetration may be painful. Vaginal dilators can sometimes help stretch the opening. When scarring is severe, the surgeon may use skin grafts to widen the entrance. Vaginal moisturizers on the external genital area can also be very helpful and promote comfort. \n \n  When the lymph nodes in the groin have been removed, women may have swelling of their genital areas or legs. Though swelling just after surgery may go away, it can become a long-term problem. This condition, called lymphedema, can cause pain, a feeling of heaviness, and fatigue. It also can be a problem during sex. Couples should discuss these issues to decide what solutions work best for them. \n \n  Orgasm after vulvectomy\n \n  Women who have had a vulvectomy may have problems reaching orgasm. It depends on how much of the vulva has been removed. The outer genitals, especially the clitoris, are important in a woman’s sexual pleasure. If surgery has removed the clitoris and lower vagina, then orgasms may not be possible and there might be numbness. \n  \n  Pelvic exenteration\n \n  Pelvic exenteration is the most extensive and complex pelvic surgery. It’s used most often when cancer of the cervix or the rectum has come back in the pelvis after treatment.\n \n  In this surgery, the uterus, cervix, ovaries, fallopian tubes, vagina, and sometimes the bladder, urethra, and/or rectum are removed. If the bladder, urethra and rectum are removed, this surgery is called a  ( a urostomy for urine and another ostomy for stool will need to be created).\n    The vagina is usually rebuilt. (See below.)\n \n  Long-term swelling in the legs (called lymphedema) may be a problem after this surgery. Contact us (800-227-2345) to learn more about this and what you can do to help prevent it or treat it.\n \n  Because pelvic exenteration is such a major surgery, some cancer centers offer counseling sessions before surgery to help a woman prepare for the changes in her body and her life.\n  \n  Since the exact surgical procedure can vary from one person to another, it may help to speak with your surgeon about the full extent of the surgery before you have it. Ask what you can expect in the way of sexual function, including orgasm, after surgery.\n \n  Vaginal reconstruction after pelvic surgery\n \n  If surgery removes only half of the vagina, penetration is still possible. But vaginal penetration of a narrow vagina may be painful at first. This is especially true if a woman has had radiation, which can make the vaginal walls firm. Penetration is easier when the vagina is shorter and wider, but movement may be awkward because of the lack of depth. Surgeons try to save as much of the front vaginal wall as possible to limit this problem.\n \n  In some cases, all or most of the vagina must be removed as part of cancer surgery, but it’s possible to rebuild a vagina with tissue from another part of the body. A  (new vagina) can be surgically made out of skin, or by using both muscle and skin from other areas of the body. This new vagina can allow a woman to have vaginal sex.\n \n  Vaginal rebuilding with skin grafts\n \n  When the vagina is repaired with skin grafts, the woman must use a vaginal stent. This stent is a special form or tube worn inside the vagina to keep it stretched. After a certain amount of time, the use of a dilator to stretch out the vagina for a few minutes each day or regular vaginal penetration during sex can help to keep the vagina open. This may become a life-long routine because without frequent stretching, the neovagina may shrink, scar, or close. \n \n  Vaginal rebuilding with muscle and skin grafts\n \n  There are other ways to rebuild the vagina using muscle and skin from other parts of the body.\n \n  A vagina that is rebuilt with muscle and skin makes little or no natural lubricant when a woman becomes sexually excited. A woman will need to prepare for sex by spreading a gel inside the vagina. If hair was present on the skin where the graft came from, she may still have a little hair inside the vagina. During sex with a rebuilt vagina, a woman may feel as if the area the skin came from is being stroked. This is because the walls of the vagina are still attached to their original nerve supply. Over time, these feelings become less distracting. They can even become sexually stimulating.\n \n  Care of the rebuilt vagina\n \n  A natural vagina has its own cleansing system. Fluids drain out, along with any dead cells. The rebuilt vagina cannot do this and needs to be cleaned with a douche to prevent discharge and odor. A doctor or nurse can offer advice on how often to douche and what type to use.\n \n  After the vagina is rebuilt, partners need to try different sexual positions to find one that is best. Minor bleeding or spotting after penetration is not a cause for alarm, but heavy or increased bleeding should be discussed with your cancer care team.\n \n  Surgery for breast cancer\n \n  Sexual problems have been linked to mastectomy and breast-conserving surgery (lumpectomy) – surgeries that remove all or part of the breast. Losing a breast can be very distressing. A few women lose both breasts. Sometimes hormone therapy or other treatment is needed, and the effects of those treatments might add to sexual problems from losing a breast.\n   \n  Surgery for breast cancer can interfere with pleasure from breast caressing. After a mastectomy, the whole breast is gone and there’s a loss of sensation or feeling. Some women still enjoy being stroked around the area of the healed scar. Others dislike being touched there and may no longer even enjoy having the remaining breast and nipple touched.\n \n  Some women who have had a mastectomy feel self-conscious being the partner on top during sex. This position makes it easy to notice that the breast is missing. Some women who have had mastectomies wear a short nightgown or camisole, or even just a bra, with the prosthesis inside during sexual activity. Other women find the breast prosthesis awkward or in the way during sex. A woman may choose to have breast reconstruction. This surgery rebuilds the shape and size of the breast. This may help a woman enjoy sex more because it may help her feel whole and attractive. But it may not fully bring back the physical feelings of pleasure she used to have from having her breast touched.\n \n  If surgery removed only the tumor (breast-conserving surgery: segmental mastectomy or lumpectomy) and was followed by radiation treatment, the breast may be scarred. It also may be different in shape, feel, or size. While getting radiation, the skin may become red and swollen. The breast also may be tender or painful in some places. As time passes, some women may have areas of numbness or decreased sensation near the surgical scar. \n \n  To learn more about physical problems related to cancer surgery and sexuality and how to talk to your cancer care team about them, see Managing Female Sexual Problems Related to Cancer.\n"

According to American Cancer Society, it is estimated that approximately 22,280 women will receive a new diagnosis of ovarian cancer and 14,240 women will die from it. Though most ovarian cancer is diagnosed in women of nonreproductive age, 12.1% of ovarian cancer patients are ≤44 years of age. The percentage of young women who survive ovarian cancer has increased as a result of improvements in diagnosis and earlier treatment; the overall 5-year survival rate for all ovarian cancers in women ≤44 years of age is 91.2% when it is found at stages 1A and 1B [1]. Young women diagnosed with cancer are interested in preserving their fertility in addition to treating cancer; however, for women with ovarian cancer, it can be especially difficult to maintain reproductive function because the ovary is site of the primary cancer. Thus, ovary containing ovarian follicles becomes a target to be treated to remove cancer cells although it should be protected for fertility. Both ovarian cancer and the off-target effects of radiation and chemotherapy on the ovaries threaten fertility, making fertility preservation particularly challenge for this group of patients. Most cases involve surgical removal of the fallopian tubes and ovaries (unilateral or bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy) and removal of the uterus (hysterectomy). Furthermore, patients will get further steps such as radiation or chemotherapy to remove remaining cancer cells [2]. This induces the death of ovarian follicles if patients keep one side of ovary during resection, resulting in loss of reproductive function in extreme case. Consequently, patients lose not only fertility but also endocrine system function and the protective effects of circulating estrogen, which can increase the risk of coronary disease, osteoporosis and cognitive dysfunction [3].\nIn the following sections, we discuss the currently available fertility preservation methods that may be applicable to some women with ovarian cancer, particularly those with unilateral disease. Ovarian cancers are generally classified as two categories dependent on origins; epithelial ovarian cancers (EOCs) and non-EOCs such as germ cell tumors, sex–cord–gonadal stromal tumors and borderline tumors. Among these, patients with early-stage EOC and borderline ovarian tumors, or those with juvenile granulosa cell tumors and germ cell tumors may be candidates for fertility preservation.\nCurrent fertility-sparing methods\n• Ovarian tissue cryopreservation\nData on the safety of fertility-sparing surgery [4] in young patients with early-stage ovarian cancer has been accumulating [5]. Current technologies being used include the preservation of ovarian tissues that are taken during unilateral ovarian cancer surgery. The surgical techniques are extensively reviewed elsewhere [6]; briefly, during ovarian tumor resection, ovarian tissue is removed from the remaining ovary and cryopreserved for future usage. These cryopreserved tissues can be transplanted into patients after completion of cancer treatment.\n• Oocyte cryopreservation\nAs with ovarian tissue cryopreservation, oocytes from the ovarian tissues can be stored. Patients with unilateral ovarian cancer may wish to preserve oocytes in contralateral ovary due to the gonadotoxicity of chemotherapy to the ovarian reserve [6]. Oocytes can be retrieved from the unaffected ovary during surgery, with or without controlled ovarian hyperstimulation. In ovarian cancer patients, transvaginal oocyte retrieval carries a risk of ovarian capsule rupture and cancer cell spillage, which can cause staging up from 1A to 1C. Moreover, controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH) can delay cancer treatment for a half month and may stimulate the rapid proliferation of hormone-dependent cancer cells such as those in granulosa cell tumor, and COH is not possible in prepubertal girls. Nevertheless, COH and intraoperative oocyte collection followed by cryopreservation has been used clinically for patients who have enough time for COH before undergoing surgery [7]. Oocytes are stored as mature or immature oocytes. Immature oocytes are matured in vitro\n and then cryopreserved as mature oocytes.\nFor women who must undergo bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, ovarian tissue and oocyte cryopreservation may not be possible and those who also undergo hysterectomy will need to consider other options, such as surrogacy, even if they have cryopreserved oocytes. Recently, successful uterine transplantation was reported [8], but application of this technique in clinical practice is still limited.\nGo to:\nFuture fertility-sparing methods\n• In vitro\n ovarian follicle growth\nA primary concern regarding the autotransplantation of cryopreserved ovarian tissue in ovarian cancer survivors is the risk of reimplantation and dissemination of the primary cancer [9]. The contralateral ovary may contain cancer cells in patients with unilateral ovarian cancer. Isolation of individual ovarian follicles from ovarian tissues and subsequent in vitro\n culture [10] may minimize the risk of transmission and reimplantation of malignant cells. Recently, mature human follicles have been successfully cultured in vitro\n to produce MII stage oocytes that could be used for IVF [11], suggesting that in vitro\n follicle culture is clinically applicable.\n• In vitro\n ovarian follicle maturation\nWhile in vitro\n culture of mature ovarian follicles is successful, one of the immature ovarian follicles is still in the experimental stage. Ovarian follicles in young girl cancer patients and cortical tissues from adult ovarian cancer patients are mostly primordial or primary follicles. Although these early stage of ovarian follicles can be isolated, they cannot be grown in vitro\n. Thus, this early stage of ovarian follicles should be activated using PTEN inhibitor or AKT activator [12], followed by in vitro\n ovarian follicle maturation. These follicles can be kept for future use.\n• Protection against germ cell damage using fertoprotective agents\nIn addition to fertility-sparing surgical approaches in early-stage ovarian cancer patients, methods are being developed to minimize the damage to germ cells (oocytes) caused by adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation therapy.\nThe most effective chemotherapeutic regimen for epithelial ovarian cancer is a combination of a platinum compound and a taxane. Platinum drugs, including cisplatin and carboplatin, have been in widespread use for treating both ovarian and testicular cancer [13]. Cisplatin is one of the most efficient chemotherapeutic agents because it kills cancer cells through DNA damage and inhibition of DNA synthesis/replication. Cisplatin transferred into cells forms interstrand and intrastrand crosslinks, making platinum-DNA adducts [14,15]. DNA damage caused by platinum drugs stimulates signal transduction pathways involved in cell death.\nRadiation is reserved for chemotherapy-resistant ovarian cancers. Lower doses of radiation therapy are used for ovarian cancers, resulting in germ cell death in the contralateral ovary in the case of unilateral oophorectomy.\nGerm cells are the most sensitive cells in the body to radiation and chemotherapy [16,17]. The reason for the high sensitivity is assumed to be related to the presence of TAp63 molecule [18], a member of Trp53 family and a main molecule of the apoptotic pathway. TAp63, as a guardian of germ cells, decides the fate of cells depending on the intensity of DNA damage. It is thought that this is a unique phenomenon in female germ cells that protects genetic material transmission from generation to generation [19]. c-Abl, an upstream molecule, has been shown to regulate TAp63 [20]. Through understanding the precise pathway of germ cell death and targeting the pathway, germ cells can be protected from the off-target effects of radiation and chemotherapy.\nDeveloping fertoprotective agents has long been studied to protect oocytes against radiation and chemotherapy. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonists and agonists, sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), imatinib mesylate, amifostin and tamoxifen [10] have been proposed for this function. Imatinib mesylate can be used for protecting oocytes through blocking c-Abl molecule in oocytes-death pathway against cisplatin [21]. Moreover, amifostin can be a good fertoprotectant to protect apoptosis in oocytes when patients get cancer treatment as shown from the cytoprotective effects of amifostine against cyclophosphamide [22]. However, none of these drugs have been tested to protect oocytes in mice carrying ovarian cancer or human. Therefore, it is necessary to test these candidate agents or clinically used drugs as well as develop new and efficient fertoprotective agents in preservation of ovarian reserve for ovarian cancer patients.\nGo to:\nConclusion\nFor young women with ovarian cancer, it is especially important to consider treatment approaches that incorporate both ovarian cancer treatment and fertility preservation. For these women, because the ovary is the source of fertility and the site of the primary cancer, the challenge is to simultaneously remove and eliminate cancer cells and protect and preserve healthy oocytes. The fertility preservation options available to women with ovarian cancer will be dependent on the stage, type and location of the cancer; therefore, collaboration within multidisciplinary teams of general gynecologists, gynecologic oncologists, embryologists, operating room staff and reproductive endocrinologists are necessary to help patients preserve their fertility and future quality of life.\nGo to:\nThe authors thank SC Tobin, MH Cordeiro and ME Edmonds for giving comments on the manuscript and editing the manuscript.\nGo to:\nFootnotes\nThis work was supported by the Center for Reproductive Health After Disease (P50HD076188) from the NIH National Center for Translational Research in Reproduction and Infertility (NCTRI; to SY Kim) and by a grant of the Korea Healthcare Technology R&D Project, Ministry of Health & Welfare, Republic of Korea (HI12C0055; to JR Lee).

        "text": "How Radiation Therapy Can Affect the Sex Life of Females with Cancer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n \n \n  \nSex is an important part of being in a relationship, but certain types of radiation therapy can cause sexual problems to develop. These problems often happen to women getting radiation to the pelvic area (lower abdomen). Managing these issues might involve several different therapies, treatments, or devices, or a combination of them. Counseling can also be helpful. \n \n  This information describes common sexual problems an adult female getting radiation to the pelvis may experience.  please talk to your cancer care team about any needs that are not addressed here.\n  \n  It’s very important to talk about what to expect, and continue to talk about what's changing or has changed in your sexual life as you go through procedures, treatments, and follow-up care.  Remember, if they don't know about a problem you're having, they can't help you manage it. \n  \n  How pelvic radiation can affect sex\n \n  Radiation to the pelvic area can affect a woman's sex life during and after treatment. This is because the radiation beams damage the delicate tissue in and around female genitals. Here are some examples of sexual effects that radiation can have. You can find more about the effects of radiation on specific types of cancers in Cancer A to Z. \n \n   \n   During treatment, tissues in the treatment area can get irritated. They may become pink and swollen and may look sunburned. A woman’s vagina may feel tender during radiation treatment and for a few weeks afterward. \n \n   Radiation to the vagina can also damage its lining, making it thin and fragile. Many women notice some light bleeding after sex, even though they felt no pain at the time. In rare cases vaginal ulcers or open sores may develop, which may take several months to heal after radiation therapy ends.\n \n   When treatment ends and the irritation heals, there might be scarring. The walls of the vagina may become leathery and tough. Treatment can also shorten or narrow the vagina. This means the walls might not stretch out as much during sex, which can cause pain. \n \n   In some cases, the bladder and bowel are damaged by radiation to the pelvis, and these changes can also impact sexual health.\n \n   If the ovaries get a large dose of radiation, they may stop working. Sometimes this is just for a short time, but often it’s permanent. If a woman has already gone through menopause, she may notice little or no change because her ovaries had already stopped making hormones. But if she hasn’t, radiation may cause sudden menopause, meaning menstruation (having periods) may stop and women may have menopausal symptoms, such as hot flashes and vaginal dryness. Young women who get smaller doses of pelvic radiation may start to menstruate again as their ovaries heal. But with larger doses of radiation therapy, the damage could be permanent.\n \n   Women who get radiation to the pelvis often become infertile. But no matter what the radiation dose, women younger than 50 should talk with their team before stopping birth control since it may still be possible to become pregnant.\n \n  \n    \n  Is it safe to have sex while getting pelvic radiation?\n \n  It's very important to talk to your cancer care team to know if you have any limitations or should take any precautions related to sex while you're getting radiation therapy. \n \n  In general, as long as a female is not bleeding heavily from a tumor in her bladder, rectum, uterus, cervix, or vagina, it's usually OK to have sex during pelvic radiation therapy. But since everyone is different, be sure to check with your cancer care team. Depending on any surgery you may have had before radiation therapy, the outer genitals and vagina might be just as sensitive as before. Reaching orgasm should be possible, too, although stress and sexual position might affect this.\n  \n  Certain types of cancer are treated with a radiation implant. An implant is a radiation source put inside the bladder, uterus, or vagina for a certain number of days. Sex likely will not be allowed while the implant is in place.\n \n  Radiation therapy from a machine outside the body does not leave any radiation in the body, so your partner will not come in contact with it. Women treated with a radiation implant transmit radiation while the implant is in place, but not after it is removed. See  Radiation Therapy  for information about the different types of radiation and the precautions you may need to take.\n \n  What can help with the effects of pelvic radiation?\n \n  There are some therapies and exercises that might help limit or soften scar tissue. Talk to your cancer care team to find out if any might be helpful for your situation. Sometimes stretching the walls of the vagina is suggested. This can be done with vaginal penetration during sex or using a vaginal dilatoron a regular basis. \n \n  To learn more about physical problems related to cancer surgery and sexuality and how to talk to your cancer care team about them, see in Managing Female Sexual Problems Related to Cancer.\n"

        "text": "Your sex life may change with ovarian cancer. Changes in hormones and treatments may make your body feel different. Your emotions may also change how you feel about sex.\nEven if your sex life changes, it can still be satisfying. Most women with ovarian cancer still feel pleasure from touching, reach orgasm, and have a healthy sex life.\nCommon Changes\nSymptoms and the mental toll of ovarian cancer may affect how you feel about sex, both physically and emotionally.\nYour body may feel weak or tired from treatment. Changes in hormones may lead to symptoms of menopause, like vaginal dryness and hot flashes. Changes in estrogen may make your vagina feel dry or tight, which can be uncomfortable or painful during sex.\nYou may notice a change in your sexual desire or libido. You may have fewer thoughts about sex or be turned off by the idea of sex.\nIf you feel different about your body or your appearance, it may affect how you feel about having sex. You may not feel like yourself after physical changes like bloating, hair loss, or weight gain. It’s common to feel emotionally detached or removed from your body.\nYour medication may also affect your sexual desire. Some medications used during and after treatment, like anti-anxiety drugs, antidepressants, anti-nausea drugs, and opiate pain medications, may lower your sex drive.\nHow to Manage Changes and Improve Your Sex Life\nEven with changes from ovarian cancer, there are many things you can do to feel good and have a satisfying sex life.\nTo make sex more comfortable, try a vaginal lubricant. Choose a water-based gel. Avoid oil-based lubricants, petroleum jelly, and skin lotions.\nFor long-term improvement, try a vaginal moisturizer. Vaginal moisturizers are non-hormonal and help renew your vaginal tissue. They may give you long-lasting relief from itching and irritation and improve your vaginal lining. Apply the moisturizer regularly, at bedtime. Remember to moisturize your vulva too.\nBe gentle. Avoid deodorants, douches, harsh soaps, lotions, and perfumes near or in your vaginal area.\nIf you feel pain during sex, you may tighten your vaginal muscles because you’re worried it’ll hurt. This makes your vagina tighter and may create more friction and irritation during sex.\nRelated Article\n Try relaxation techniques to help you control your vaginal muscles. By tensing and then relaxing your muscles, you’ll have better control of them and be able to relax them more during sex.\nRelated Article\n \nTalk to a sex educator, counselor, or therapist. They may help you work on mind-body techniques to help you with intimacy. They can help with physical problems and emotional issues to help you feel better about yourself and improve your sex life.\n \nDo things that make you feel good about yourself. Learn to embrace your natural look. Or try new wigs, hats, scarves, or clothes that make you feel more attractive. Surround yourself with people who you feel good with. Try meditation or yoga. Do more of what makes you happy.\n"

        "text": "How Hormone Therapy and Chemo Can Affect the Sex Life of Females with Cancer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n \n \n  \nSex is an important part of being in a relationship, but hormone therapy and certain types of chemotherapy can cause sexual problems to develop. Managing these issues might involve several different therapies, treatments, or devices, or a combination of them. Counseling can also be helpful. \n \n  The information below describes common sexual problems an adult female getting chemo or hormone therapy may experience.  please talk to your cancer care team about any needs that are not addressed here.\n  \n  It’s very important to talk about what to expect, and continue to talk about what's changing or has changed in your sexual life as you go through procedures, treatments, and follow-up care.  Remember, if they don't know about a problem you're having, they can't help you manage it.\n  \n  How chemotherapy can affect sex\n \n  It’s very important to talk to your cancer care team about if it's safe to have sex while getting chemo. There might be limitations to what you can do, or precautions you need to take to keep you and your partner safe.\n \n  You can find out about the effects of chemo on specific types of cancers in Cancer A to Z. Chemo is often given through an intravenous (IV) tube into a vein in the bloodstream, and some chemo pills are given by mouth (orally). Both IV and oral chemo send the drug traveling throughout the body. Some types of chemo can directly affect how a woman's sex organs function, or change hormone levels. Your doctor will be able to tell you if your treatment plan includes any of these chemo drugs.\n \n  In some cases, the drugs are sent right to the tumor through a catheter or port. Some drugs might have sexual effects, and here are some examples:\n \n   \n   For cancer of the bladder, chemo is sometimes put right into the bladder through a catheter. Treatment like this usually only has a minor effect on a woman’s sex life. But she may notice some pain during sex because the bladder and urethra may be irritated from the drugs.\n \n   Women with tumors in the pelvis may get chemo by pelvic infusion through a catheter. Depending on the type and dose of chemo, there could be long-term effects on a woman’s sex life.\n \n   Another way of giving chemo is by intraperitoneal infusion. The drugs and extra fluid are put into the space around the tumor,  using a port in the abdomen (belly). The extra fluid causes the abdomen to swell. The drugs and liquid are then drained out after a short period of time.\n \n  \n  \n  Pregnancy and fertility during and after chemo\n \n   You need to know if treatment will affect your fertility. See Female Fertility and Cancer for more information.\n \n  Many of the drugs used to treat cancer can harm an unborn baby. Because of this, women are usually advised to use birth control to keep from getting pregnant during treatment. Even if you think you can't get pregnant, you should talk to your doctor about this. It's important to know what kind of birth control is best and safest for you to use. If you want to get pregnant, talk with your doctor about how long you should wait after treatment is over.\n \n  After chemo, it may still be possible for some women to get pregnant. Keep in mind that, even if you’re still having monthly periods, it’s hard to say if you will be able to get pregnant. Women who don’t want to become pregnant should use birth control, even after having chemo, and should talk to their doctor about how long birth control will be needed.\n \n  Early menopause with chemo\n \n  Women who have not yet started menopause and are getting chemo might have symptoms of early menopause during and after treatment. These symptoms include hot flashes, vaginal dryness, vaginal tightness, and irregular or no menstrual periods. If the lining of the vagina thins because of treatment, there may be a light spotting of blood after sex.\n \n  Other chemo-related problems that may affect your sex life\n \n  Some chemo drugs that irritate the mouth might also affect all mucous membranes in the body. This includes the lining of the vagina, which may become dry and inflamed.\n \n  Infections that affect sex can happen because chemo can weaken the immune system. If you have a vaginal infection, tell your team and have it treated right away. For example:\n \n   \n   Yeast infections could happen during chemo, especially in women taking steroids or antibiotics to treat or prevent bacterial infections. If you have a yeast infection, you may notice itching inside your vagina or on the vulva. You may also have a thick, whitish discharge, and you may feel some burning during sex. Yeast infections might be prevented by not wearing pantyhose, nylon panties, or tight pants. Wear loose clothing and cotton panties to avoid trapping moisture in the vaginal area. Wipe front to back after emptying your bladder and do not douche. Your doctor may also prescribe a vaginal cream or suppository to reduce yeast or other organisms that grow in the vagina.\n \n   If you've had flare-ups of genital herpes or genital warts in the past, chemo may make them happen again.\n \n   It’s important to avoid sexually transmitted diseases. If you are having sex with someone,  practice safe sex from start to finish (use condoms or other barriers to avoid body fluids). Do this every time you have oral, anal, or vaginal sex.\n \n   It’s important to avoid touching the vagina and the urethra with anything that has been used to stroke near the anus. Lingering germs from the bowel can cause infection if they get into these areas.\n \n  \n \n  Chemo and sexual desire\n \n  Chemo has different side effects that can have an impact on sexual desire, such as fatigue, mouth soreness, neuropathy, nausea, decreased appetite, and pain.  Anxiety or depression can also affect your sex life and leave little energy for sex. Sexual desire often returns when a woman feels better, or in between cycles of treatments.\n \n  Women getting chemo also tend to be sensitive about their appearance. Hair loss, weight loss or gain, and skin changes might happen, depending on the type of chemo you're getting. \n \n  How hormone therapy can affect sex\n \n  Hormone therapy may be used to treat certain types of cancers of the breast and the lining of the uterus (endometrial cancer). This treatment blocks hormones these cancers need to grow. Since sexual desire and sexual function are affected by hormones, blocking them can affect your sex life. \n \n  There are different types of hormone therapy, so be sure you understand which one is part of your treatment plan. Know the possible side effects so you know what to expect, and how to help manage them. It's also important to talk to your partner about what might be expected. Some of these side effects can be very bothersome, and adjusting to them can be hard to do. They include hot flashes, menstrual cycle changes, and vaginal dryness.\n \n  You can find out about the effects of hormone therapy on specific types of cancers in Cancer A to Z.\n \n  To learn more about physical problems related to cancer surgery and sexuality and how to talk to your cancer care team about them, see in Managing Female Sexual Problems Related to Cancer.\n"

        "text": "Managing Female Sexual Problems Related to Cancer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n \n \n  \nSex, sexuality, and intimacy are just as important for people with cancer as they are for people who don’t have cancer. In fact, sexuality and intimacy have been shown to help people face cancer by helping them deal with feelings of distress, and when going through treatment. But, the reality is that a person's sex organs, sexual desire (sex drive or libido), sexual function, well-being, and body image can be affected by having cancer and cancer treatment. How a person shows sexuality can also be affected. Read more in How Cancer and Cancer Treatment Can Affect Sexuality.\n \n  Managing sexual problems is important, but might involve several different therapies, treatments, or devices, or a combination of them. Counseling can also be helpful. The information below describes ways to approach some of the more common sexual problems an adult female with cancer may experience.  please talk to your cancer care team about any needs that are not addressed here.\n    \n  Ask about possible changes in sexuality from treatment\n \n  It’s very important to talk about what to expect, and continue to talk about what's changing or has changed in your sexual life as you go through procedures, treatments, and follow-up care.  Remember, if they don't know about a problem you're having, they can't help you manage it. Here are some ways you can start talks with your cancer care team about the problems you might be having.\n \n  Know when to ask questions\n \n  The best time to talk with your doctor or cancer team about possible side effects or long-term changes in your sex life is before treatment. If this isn't possible, or you don't think about asking these kinds of questions before surgery or treatment, you can start to talk with them shortly after surgery or when treatment starts. But you can bring up the subject any time during and after treatment, too.\n \n  Ask the right questions\n \n  It’s important to know what to expect. When you're asking questions before surgery or treatment, here are some that can open the door to more questions and follow-up:\n \n   \n   Will my surgery affect my sex life? If so, what can I expect?\n \n   Will my treatment (radiation, chemo, hormone therapy, etc) affect my sex life? If so, what can I expect?\n \n   Will the effects last a short time, a long time, or be permanent?\n \n   What can be done about these effects? Is there a cost to what can be done?\n \n   Can I see a specialist or counselor?\n \n   Are there any other treatments that are just as effective for my cancer but have different side effects?\n \n   Do you have any materials I can read or where do you recommend I find more information?\n \n  \n \n  Maybe you've already had surgery or started treatment, but didn't ask questions (or get enough information) beforehand. Maybe you've read some things on the internet or heard about someone else's experience with the same type of cancer you have. Maybe you're able to think more clearly now than when you were first diagnosed and realize you have questions. Whatever the reason, if you wondering about something, ask! Here are some ways to start talking with your cancer care team:\n \n   \n   \"I was reading about (surgery/treatment) and that it might cause sexual problems. Can you explain that to me?\"\n \n   \"I know someone who went through this same thing and heard about problems they had with sex. Can you give me more information about this?\"\n \n   \"I notice a change in how I feel about sex/when I'm having sex. Can you talk to me about this? Is this normal and what can I do?\"\n \n   \"I am having trouble adjusting to some changes in my body. What can I do?\"\n \n  \n \n  Managing common sexual problems in adult females with cancer\n \n  Premature (early) menopause\n \n  Depending on the stage in life, type of cancer, and type of surgery and treatment needed, some women are at an increased risk for reduced hormones. If the woman has already gone through the \"change of life\" (menopause), the chance of having these symptoms might not be as high. But some women have surgery or treatment that brings on these hormone changes before they would naturally happen, and this is called premature menopause. This causes monthly hormone cycles to slow or stop, meaning monthly periods (menstruation) stop. It's also known as . \n \n  It's important to know how surgery and treatment might affect your cycles and hormones. This is important for all women so they know the symptoms to expect. But it's especially important for younger women because of the possibility of pregnancy if cycles do not completely end or if hormones are not permanently affected. Ask your cancer care team about your specific situation. \n \n   \n   Surgeries that can lead to premature menopause include removal of the ovaries or a total hysterectomy (removal of the ovaries is included in this procedure). These surgeries cause menopause to be permanent. \n \n   For women who still have their ovaries, including those who are still having periods, certain types of radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and hormone therapy can lead to ovarian failure which causes premature menopause. Sometimes this menopause can be temporary, but many times it is permanent. \n \n  \n \n  If you can expect to go through premature menopause, or have gone through it because of cancer surgery or treatment, you may be bothered by frequent hot flashes and other symptoms.\n \n   \n   Hot flashes, or flushes, can happen throughout the day but can be especially bothersome at night. They may include other symptoms, such as chills, flushing (redness and warm) on the face, anxiety, and feeling like your heart is racing. You can learn more about hot flashes and how to manage them in Hot Flashes. \n \n   Some women may have lower sexual desire, which can be affected by menopause symptoms as well as by stress and poor sleep.\n \n   Hormone changes can also cause vaginal pain and dryness, and thinning of vaginal tissues.\n \n  \n \n  Female hormones (estrogen and/or progesterone) in a pill or patch can help with menopause symptoms. But, some women may not be able to take hormones because of the type of cancer they have. Sometimes these hormones are not recommended because they can promote certain types of cancer growth in female organs. They can cause other health problems, too. \n \n  f you have questions or concerns about hormone therapy, talk with your cancer care team about the risks and benefits as they apply to you. If you and your provider decide that hormone therapy is the best treatment for you, be sure you understand the correct dose to use, when to use it, and when to expect it to take effect. Sometimes doses need to be changed to get the best effect. However, it’s important that doses are monitored and that you have regular check-ups.\n  \n  Vaginal dryness and atrophy\n \n  Vaginal fluids and moisture are important for sexual function, and can make gynecologic exams more comfortable. As women age, the vagina can naturally lose moisture and elasticity (the ability to stretch or move comfortably). Cancer surgeries and treatments can speed up these changes. Vaginal dryness and atrophy can make intercourse difficult, and sometimes painful. As with hot flashes, taking hormones can help. But, sometimes these hormones are not recommended because they can promote certain types of cancer growth in female organs.\n \n  Lubricants\n \n  Fluids increase in your vagina when you are excited. If you have vaginal dryness, you may need extra lubrication to make sex comfortable. If you use a vaginal lubricant, it's best to choose a water-based gel that has no perfumes, coloring, spermicide, herbal remedies, or flavors added, as these chemicals can irritate your delicate genital tissues. Also, warming gels can cause burning in some people.  Lubricants can usually be found near the birth control or feminine hygiene products in drug stores or grocery stores. Be sure to read the labels, and talk with a nurse, doctor, or pharmacist if you have questions.\n \n  Petroleum jelly, skin lotions, and other oil-based lubricants are not good choices for vaginal lubrication. In some women, they may raise the risk of yeast infection. And if latex condoms are used, they can be damaged by petroleum products and lotions. Also, watch out for condoms or gels that contain nonoxynol-9 (N-9). N-9 is a birth control agent that kills sperm, but it can irritate the vagina, especially if the tissues are already dry or fragile.\n \n  Before sex, put some lubricant around and inside the entrance of your vagina. Then spread some of it on your partner’s penis, fingers, or other insert. This helps get the lubricant inside your vagina. Many couples treat this as a part of foreplay. If vaginal penetration lasts more than a few minutes, you may need to stop briefly and use more lubricant. Even if you use vaginal moisturizers every few days, it’s best to use gel lubricant before and during sex.\n \n  Vaginal moisturizers\n  \n  Vaginal moisturizers are designed to help keep your vagina moist and at a more normal acid balance (pH) for a few days. Vaginal moisturizers are applied at bedtime for the best absorption. It’s not uncommon for women who’ve had cancer to need to use moisturizers several times per week. Vaginal moisturizers are different than lubricants – they last longer and are not usually used for sexual activity.\n  \n  Vaginal estrogens\n \n  Vaginal estrogen therapy is a treatment option for vaginal atrophy (when the vaginal walls get thinner and less stretchy) for some women. But, some women may not be able to take hormones because of the type of cancer they have. Sometimes these hormones are not recommended because the estrogens can promote certain types of cancer growth in female organs.\n \n  Vaginal hormones are applied to and absorbed into the genital area. They come in gel, cream, suppository, ring, and tablet forms. Most are put into the vagina, although some creams can be applied to the vulva (outer part of the vagina). They focus small amounts of hormones on the vagina and nearby tissues, so that very little gets in the bloodstream to affect other parts of the body. Local vaginal hormones need a prescription.\n \n  Reaching orgasm after cancer treatment\n \n  Usually, women who could reach orgasm before cancer treatment can do so after treatment. But some women may have problems with this.\n  \n   Here are a few ideas that might help.\n \n   \n   Having a sexual fantasy before or during sex. A fantasy can be a memory of a past experience or a daydream about something you’ve never tried. A strongly sexual thought can distract you from negative thoughts and fears about performing.\n \n   Using a hand-held vibrator for extra stimulation. Hold it yourself, or ask your partner to caress your genitals with it. You can steer your partner to the areas that respond best and away from those that are tender or uncomfortable.\n \n   Changing the position of your legs during sexual activity. Some women reach orgasm more easily with their legs open and thigh muscles tense. Others prefer to press their thighs together.\n \n   Tighten and relax your vaginal muscles in rhythm during sex or while your clitoris is being stroked. Or, tighten and relax the muscles in time with your breathing. This helps you focus on what you’re feeling. Contract your vaginal muscles and pull them inward as you inhale, and let them relax loosely as you exhale.\n \n   Asking your partner to gently touch your breasts and genital area at the same time or separately. Experiment with your partner to find the type of touch that most excites you.\n \n  \n \n  You also can talk with your cancer care team and gynecologist for referral for counseling and sex therapy that can be helpful.\n \n  Pain during sex\n \n  Genital pain\n \n  For women who have vaginal dryness or atrophy, sex may be painful. This is called . Pain may be felt in the vagina itself or in the tissues around it, like the bladder and rectum. After certain surgeries and radiation to the pelvis or genital area, the vagina is sometimes shorter and narrower. But hormone changes are the most common cause of vaginal pain after cancer treatment. If you don’t produce enough natural lubricant or moisture to make your vagina slippery, sex can be painful. It can cause a burning feeling or soreness. The risk of repeated urinary tract infections or irritation also increases when there is vaginal irritation during sex.\n \n  If you have genital pain during sex:\n \n   \n   Tell your cancer care team or gynecologist about the pain. Do not let embarrassment keep you from getting medical care.\n \n   Make sure your partner knows the pain may not be as bad if you feel very aroused before you start vaginal sex. Your vagina expands to its fullest length and width only when you are highly excited. This is also when the walls of the vagina produce lubricating fluid. It may take a longer time and more touching to get fully aroused.\n \n   Use water-based lubricating gel around and in your vagina before vaginal penetration. You can also use lubrication suppositories (soft gel pellets) that melt during foreplay.\n \n   Let your partner know if any types of touching cause pain. Show your partner ways to caress you or positions that don’t hurt. Usually, light touching around the clitoris and the entrance to the vagina won’t hurt, especially if the area is well-lubricated.\n \n   For vaginal sex, try a position that lets you control the movement. Then, if deep penetration hurts, you can make the thrusts less deep. You can also control the speed.\n \n   Learning to be aware of pelvic muscles and how to control them is important in understanding and managing vaginal pain. Once a woman has felt pain during sex, she often becomes tense in sexual situations. Without knowing it, she may tighten the muscles just inside the entrance of the vagina. This makes vaginal penetration even more painful. Sometimes she clenches her muscles so tightly that her partner cannot even enter her vagina. You can become aware of your vaginal muscles and learn to relax them during vaginal penetration. Exercises that teach control of the pelvic floor and vaginal muscles are called Kegels \n \n   Your doctor may be able to refer you to a special therapist for pelvic physical therapy or pelvic rehabilitation. This therapy might help you relax your vaginal muscles and help you manage pain during sex.\n \n  \n  \n  Non-genital pain\n \n  Other types of pain that are not in your genital area can affect how comfortable you are during sex. If you’re having pain other than in your genital area, these tips may help lessen it during sex. You might need to plan sexual activity rather than be spontaneous for some of these to help. \n \n   \n   If you’re using pain medicine, take it an hour or so before having sex so it will be working when you’re ready.\n \n   Find a position that puts as little pressure as possible on the sore areas of your body. If it helps, support the sore area and limit its movement with pillows. If a certain motion is painful, choose a position that doesn’t require it or ask your partner to take over the movements during sex. You can guide your partner on what you would like and what makes you most comfortable.\n \n   Focus on your feelings of pleasure and excitement. With this focus, sometimes the pain lessens or fades into the background.\n \n  \n         \n   \n  \n           \n   \n    \n \n  Vaginal dilator\n \n  A vaginal dilator is a plastic or rubber tube used to enlarge or stretch (dilate) the vagina. Dilators also help women learn to relax the vaginal muscles if they are used with Kegel exercises. They come in many forms and are often used after radiation to the pelvis, cervix, or vagina. Even if a woman isn’t interested in staying sexually active, keeping her vagina normal in size allows more comfortable gynecologic exams.\n \n  If it's needed, your doctor or nurse will tell you where to buy a dilator. Check with your insurance company, too, and find out if you need a prescription. You will also be taught when to start using it, and how and when to use it. The dilator feels much like putting in a large tampon for a few minutes. It can be used several times a week to keep your vagina from getting tight from scar tissue that may develop. \n             \n  Special aspects of some cancer treatments\n \n  Breast surgery\n \n  Surgery for breast cancer might not directly affect sexual function and doesn't directly affect intercourse. However, it can have an impact on body image. And, sensation when being touched during sex can be reduced in the area that's affected by breast surgery. \n \n   \n   Breast-conserving surgery (also called a lumpectomy, quadrantectomy, partial mastectomy, or segmental mastectomy) \nis a surgery \nin which only the part of the breast containing the cancer is removed. The goal is to remove the cancer as well as some surrounding normal tissue. How much breast is removed depends on where and how big the tumor is, as well as other factors.\n \n   Mastectomy is a surgery in which the entire breast is removed, including all of the breast tissue and sometimes other nearby tissues. There are several different types of mastectomies. Some women may have a double mastectomy, in which both breasts are removed.\n \n  \n \n  Managing the physical and psychological effects of having breast surgery is important. Many woman having surgery for breast cancer might have and choose the option of breast reconstruction. This can include nipple reconstruction too, and tattooing for the nipple and surrounding area. Counseling and support groups may be helpful too. Some women feel more comfortable and have a better self-image with these options, but they often require multiple procedures. Read more in Breast Reconstruction Surgery and talk to your cancer care team, surgeon, and gynecologist about what is best for your situation. \n \n  Urostomy, colostomy, or iIeostomy\n \n  An ostomy is a surgical opening created to help with a body function. The opening itself is called a .\n \n   \n   A urostomy takes urine through a new passage and sends it out through a stoma on the abdomen (belly).\n \n   A colostomy and ileostomy are both stomas on the belly for getting rid of body waste (stool). In an ileostomy, the opening is made with the part of the small intestine called the ileum. A colostomy is made with a part of large intestine called the colon.\n \n  \n \n  There are ways to reduce the effect of ostomies on your sex life. One way is to be sure the appliance (pouch system) fits well. Check the seal and empty your pouch before sex. This will reduce the chance of a leak. Learn more in Ostomies.\n    \n  Tracheostomy and laryngectomy\n \n  A tracheostomy is a surgery that removes the windpipe (trachea). It can be temporary or permanent, and you breathe through a stoma (opening or hole) in your neck.\n \n  Laryngectomy is surgery that removes the voice box (larynx). It leaves you unable to talk in the normal way, and since the larynx is next to the windpipe that connects the mouth to the lungs, you breathe through a stoma (hole) in your neck.\n \n  A scarf, necklace, or turtleneck can look good and hide the stoma cover.\n \n  During sex, a partner may be startled at first by breath that hits at a strange spot. You can lessen odors from the stoma by avoiding garlic or spicy foods and by wearing perfume.\n \n  Sometimes problems in speaking can make it hard for couples to communicate during sex. If you’ve learned to speak using your esophagus, talking during sex is not a big problem. A speech aid or electronic voice box built into the stoma might also work well.\n  \n  Treatment for head and neck cancer\n \n  Some cancers of the head and neck are treated by removing part of the bone structure of the face. This can change your appearance. Surgery on the jaw, palate, or tongue can also change the way you look and talk. Facial reconstruction might help regain a more normal look and clearer speech.\n \n  Limb amputation\n \n  Treatment for some cancers can include surgically removing (amputating) a limb, such as an arm or leg. A patient who has lost an arm or leg may wonder whether to wear the artificial limb (prosthesis) during sex. Sometimes the prosthesis helps with positioning and ease of movement.\n  \n  Feeling good about yourself and feeling good about sex\n   \n  Sometimes friends and lovers withdraw emotionally from a person with cancer. Don’t give up on each other. It may take time and effort, but keep in mind that sexual touching between a woman and her partner is always possible. It may be easy to forget this, especially if you’re both feeling down or haven’t had sex for a while. See \"Keep talking and work together to manage problems\" in Cancer, Sex, and the Female Body for some tips to help you and your partner through this time.  And keep in mind that you may need extra help with the changes caused by cancer that can turn your and your partner’s lives upside down.\n \n  Changes in the way you look\n \n  Cancer surgery and treatment can affect your appearance. Surgical scars may be visible. Women with breast cancer may lose a breast. Hair loss can occur with some treatments, including hair on your head, and possibly eyebrows, eyelashes, and pubic hair, too. You may also gain or lose weight, and muscle mass may be affected by the activity you can and can't do, or if you have trouble eating. Certain treatments can cause skin rash and changes. Your nails may be affected, too. Read more in Caring for Your Appearance. \n     \n  Feeling good about yourself begins with focusing on your positive features. Talk to your cancer care team about things that can be done to limit the damage cancer can do to the way you look, your energy, and your sense of well-being. When you’re going through cancer treatment, you can feel more attractive by disguising the changes cancer has made and drawing attention to your best points.\n \n  What do you see when you look at yourself in the mirror? Some people notice only what they dislike about their looks. This mirror exercise can help you adjust to body changes:\n  \n   \n   Find a time when you have privacy for at least 15 minutes. Be sure to take enough time to really think about how you look. Study yourself for that whole time, using the largest mirror you have. What parts of your body do you look at most? What do you avoid seeing? Do you catch yourself having negative thoughts about the way you look? What are your best features? Has cancer or its treatment changed the way you look?\n \n   First, try the mirror exercise when dressed. If you normally wear clothing or special accessories to disguise changes from treatment, wear them during the mirror exercise. Practice this 2 or 3 times, or until you can look in the mirror and see at least 3 positive things about your looks.\n \n   Once you’re comfortable seeing yourself as a stranger might see you, try the mirror exercise when dressed as you would like to look for your partner. If you’ve had an ostomy, for example, wear a bathrobe or teddy you like. Look at yourself for a few minutes, repeating the steps in the first mirror exercise. What’s most attractive and sexy about you? Give yourself at least 3 compliments on how you look.\n \n   Finally, try the mirror exercise in the nude, without disguising any changes made by the cancer. If you have trouble looking at a scar, bare scalp, or an ostomy, take enough time to get used to looking at the area. Most changes are not nearly as ugly as they seem at first. If you feel tense while looking at yourself, take a deep breath and try to let all your muscles relax as you exhale. Don’t stop the exercise until you have found 3 positive features, or at least remember the 3 compliments you paid yourself before.\n \n  \n \n  The mirror exercise may also help you feel more relaxed when your partner looks at you. Ask your partner to tell you some of the things that are enjoyable about the way you look or feel to the touch. Explain that these positive responses will help you feel better about yourself. Remember them when you’re feeling unsure.\n \n  Dealing with negative thoughts\n \n  Working on what you think about can help make a sexual experience better.  Try to become more aware of what you tell yourself about how attractive or sensual you feel. There are ways to help turn negative thoughts around. For example:\n \n   \n   Write down 3 negative thoughts you have most often about yourself as a sexual person. \n \n   Now write down a positive thought to counter each negative thought. For example, if you said, “No one wants a woman with a urostomy,” you could say to yourself, “I can wear a lacy ostomy cover during sex. If someone can’t accept me as a lover with an ostomy, then they’re not the right person for me.” The next time you are in a sexual situation, use your positive thoughts to override the negative ones you usually have.\n \n   If you have a favorite feature, this is a good time to indulge yourself a little and play it up.\n \n   If negative thoughts intrude and you find yourself overwhelmed or discouraged, you may want to talk with your cancer care team about working with a mental health professional.\n \n  \n \n  Depression is common during and after cancer treatment and has a huge effect on your life, including your thoughts, relationships, and overall well-being. If you lack interest in things you usually enjoy or are unable to feel pleasure and happiness, please talk to your cancer care team.\n    \n  Overcoming anxiety about sex\n \n  Sometimes because of a cancer-related symptom or treatment side effect, it might not be possible to be as spontaneous as you were in the past. The most important thing is to open up the topic for discussion and begin scheduling some relaxed time together.\n \n  Self-stimulation (or masturbation) is not a required step in restarting your sex life, but it can be helpful.  It can also help you find out where you might be tender or sore, so that you can let your partner know what to avoid.\n  \n  Sexual activity with your partner\n \n  Just as you learned to enjoy sex when you started having sex, you can learn how to feel pleasure during and after cancer treatment.\n \n  Depending on your situation, you may feel a little shy. It might be hard to let your partner know you would like to be physically close, so be as clear and direct as you can.\n        \n  Making sex more comfortable\n \n  If you still have some pain or feel weak from cancer treatment, you might want to try new positions. Many couples have found one favorite position, particularly for vaginal penetration, and rarely try another. Talk to your partner and learn different ways to enjoy sex that are most comfortable. The drawings below are some ideas for positions that may help in resuming sex.\n  \n \n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\nThere's no one position that's right for everyone. You and your partner can work together to find what’s best for you. Pillows can help as supports. Keeping a sense of humor can always lighten up the mood.\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            Written by\n        \n"

        "text": "Cancer, Sex, and the Single Female\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n \n  \n  \nThe single female and cancer\n \n  Being single can mean someone is unmarried, does not have a domestic partner, or is not currently in a romantic relationship. It has nothing to do with their sexual orientation or gender identity, but rather their relationship status. \n \n  Single people who have cancer often have the same physical, psychological, spiritual, and financial concerns as people with cancer who are married, have a partner, or are in a relationship. But for single people, these issues can be more concerning  and getting through treatment can be harder in some ways. Single people with cancer have several needs that others may not, because:\n \n   \n   They may live alone, might be a single parent, and might have less support at home. \n \n   They may live far away from family and friends.\n \n   They may be dating or thinking about getting back into the dating scene. This can make them worry how a future partner might react when they learn about their cancer or that a body part has been removed, or if there are fertility problems. \n \n   It may be harder to deal with the demands of treatment, such as if they need time off work, rides to appointments, child care, or help around the house.\n \n   They usually have just one income source. \n \n   They might be newly single after a relationship that was going on before their diagnosis has ended.\n \n  \n \n  Relationship experts suggest that cancer survivors should not have more problems finding a date than people who are not cancer survivors. However, studies show that survivors who had cancer in their childhood or teenage years might feel anxious about dating and being in social situations if they had limited social activities during their illness and treatment. For survivors who had or have cancer as an adult, a personal or family experience with cancer can affect a possible partner's reaction to hearing about the survivor's cancer . For example, a widow or a divorced person whose former partner had a history of cancer may have a different reaction than someone who has not had the same experience.\n \n   \n      \n  Common dating concerns in women with cancer\n \n  Studies show single female cancer survivors are most worried about:\n \n   \n   Telling a possible partner about their cancer history, when to tell them, and how much to tell.\n \n   Having a poor body image or feeling unattractive because their appearance has changed, such as weight changes, hair loss, or loss of a breast or other body part.\n \n   Physical problems such as fatigue, pain, or neuropathy, or problems that might affect sexual function, bowel and bladder function, or how they walk or talk.\n \n   Being able to have children in the future (fertility) and the health of future children.\n \n   Believing not many people will want to date them.\n \n   Fear of starting a relationship because cancer might come back.\n \n   Being uncomfortable taking their clothes off, letting someone touch their scars, or having sex\n \n   Feeling the need to move quickly in a relationship because they don't want to \"waste time.\"\n \n  \n \n  When is the right time to start dating \n \n  Deciding when to start dating after a cancer diagnosis is a personal choice. Single people with cancer need to make their own decision about this. Some people might think dating will help them feel \"normal\" and going out helps them keep their mind off issues related to their cancer. \n \n  Studies show some find it challenging to start a new relationship or when trying to date during treatment. If you're recovering from surgery, getting regular treatments, or treatments in cycles, or dealing with side effects of medications, being \"yourself\" on a date can be hard. Your appearance might have changed, or your energy level might be lower. In addition to having home and family responsibilities, you also might have extra appointments that use up some of your personal time. For these reasons, many people with cancer wait until treatment has ended or until they've had a chance to recover before they join the dating scene again.\n \n  When to talk about cancer\n \n  If you're thinking about dating for the first time since being diagnosed with cancer, it's important to think about if and when you want to mention you're a cancer survivor. Some people might want to give this information up front, and even list it in their profile if they're using a dating site or app. Others might prefer to have a face-to-face talk about it when they meet someone. And some people might want to wait until they've been dating someone for a while or until a relationship becomes serious. \n \n  Being comfortable talking about your cancer might not be possible, but it's best to tell someone about having cancer before make a strong commitment. \n  \n  How to bring it up\n \n  Try having “the cancer talk” when you and your partner are relaxed and in an intimate mood. Tell your partner you have something important you’d like to discuss. Then ask them a question that leaves room for many answers. This gives them a chance to take in the new information and respond. It also helps you see how they take the news.\n \n  You might want to start with something like this: “I really like where our relationship is going, and I need you to know that I have (or had) _____ cancer. How do you think that might affect our relationship?”\n \n  You can also share your own feelings: “I have (or had) ________ cancer. I guess I haven’t wanted to bring it up because I’ve been worried about how you’d react to it. It also scares me to think about it, but I need you to know about it. What are your thoughts or feelings about it?”\n \n  You may want to practice how you might tell a dating partner about your cancer history. What message do you want to give? Try some different ways of saying it, and ask a friend for feedback. Did you come across the way you wanted to? Ask your friend to take the role of a new partner, and have them give you different types of responses to your question.\n \n  How much to tell\n \n  If you have had a body part removed, or if you have an ostomy, large scars, or a sexual problem, you may be worried about how much to tell a new dating partner. You may want to tell your full cancer history all at once, or little by little over a few dates. There are no hard-and-fast rules, but telling the truth and trusting the person you're talking to are very important.\n \n  The possibility of rejection\n \n  It's possible that someone you're interested in dating might not want to date a cancer survivor. Or, once they know your full story, it might be too much for them to handle. It's important to remember that even without cancer, people reject each other because of looks, beliefs, personality, or their own issues.\n \n  Also remember that being single does not mean being alone, or being unloved. There are many in-person and online support groups that have members who are single people, too. Connecting, learning, and sharing your story with people who are in similar situations can be very helpful. You can feel more supported and confident when someone listens to you and truly understands. And, feeling some confidence in yourself can help you feel ready to date, be able to handle the possibility of being rejected, and help you know you can move on.  \n      \n  Improving your social life\n \n  Try working on areas of your social life, too.  Single people can avoid feeling alone by reconnecting with old friends and building a new network of close friends, casual friends, and family. Make the effort to call friends, plan visits, and share activities. Get involved in hobbies, special interest groups, or classes that will increase your social circle.\n \n  Support groups can help, too. Some volunteer and support groups are geared for people who have faced cancer. You may also want to try some one-on-one or group counseling. You can form a more positive view of yourself when you get objective feedback about your strengths from others. Make a list of your good points as a partner. What do you like about yourself? What are your talents and skills? What can you offer your partner in a relationship? What makes you a good sex partner? Whenever you catch yourself using cancer as an excuse not to meet new people or date, remind yourself of these things.\n"

        "text": "Questions Adult Females Have About Cancer and Sex\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n \n \n  \nEvery person with cancer is different, and there are many different types of surgeries and treatments for cancer. Sexuality and intimacy have been shown to help people face cancer by helping them deal with feelings of distress, and when going through treatment. But, the reality is that a person's sex organs, sexual desire (sex drive or libido), sexual function, well-being, and body image can be affected by having cancer and cancer treatment. How a person shows sexuality can also be affected. Read more in How Cancer and Cancer Treatment Can Affect Sexuality. \n \n  Sexuality is very personal. Because each person's situation is different, we cannot list every possible problem here. It's important to ask questions so your cancer care team can answer them so your stress, anxiety, and fears can be lessened, and you can get help to manage any sexual problems you might have.\n \n  This information is for adult females with cancer. , please talk to your cancer care team about any needs that are not addressed here.\n \n  Questions to ask about sex or your sexuality\n \n  People with cancer might be concerned about changes in appearance due to scars or hair loss, loss of a body part, sexual function, sexual performance, being able to have a child, and if it's safe to have sex. Depending on the type of cancer, surgery, and treatment needed, there are some situations when precautions need to be taken or when sex may need to be avoided for a while, and this can be different for everyone. \n \n   Many studies have found that doctors, nurses, and other members of a health care team don’t always ask about sexuality, sexual orientation, or gender identity during check-ups and treatment visits. Because of this, patients might not get enough information, support, or resources to help them deal with their feelings and sexual problems. But if you are concerned about how cancer or its treatment might affect (or has affected) your sex life, it’s important to bring it up and to get answers to your questions, even if it makes you uncomfortable.\n \n  After a cancer diagnosis\n \n  For a period of time when you are first diagnosed, your mind may not been able to focus on anything except your cancer. You may have very few sexual feelings because many people are more concerned about the future than about having sex. In some cases, surgery or treatment is scheduled very quickly after a diagnosis. In other cases, you have some time (maybe several days or weeks) to let the diagnosis sink in. Here are a few questions you can ask to start the discussion with your cancer care team in the time between your diagnosis and surgery or treatment. Starting sexual discussions early might help you feel more comfortable talking about them throughout your cancer journey.\n \n   \n   What kinds of sexual problems might happen because of my cancer?\n \n   Is it safe to have sex before my surgery and treatment?\n \n   Do I need to use protection or birth control before my surgery and treatment?\n \n  \n \n  Before surgery \n \n  If having surgery to remove a tumor or body part is in your treatment plan, here are some questions you might want to ask before the procedure. Keep in mind not all of these questions are right for everyone. What questions you ask depend on your age, stage in life, relationship status, and the type of cancer and surgery you're having. If you forget or don't think about asking them before surgery, it's a good idea to ask questions as soon as possible after surgery. This way, you know what to expect as you recover from your operation. \n \n   \n   How will this surgery affect my appearance?\n \n   Does a body part or organ need to be removed? If so, will it be removed partially or completely? Can it be replaced, transplanted, or reconstructed?\n \n   How big will my scar be?\n \n   How will this surgery affect my sex life? Will it affect my sexual desire, response, or function? What can be done about these effects?\n \n   How soon can I have sex after my surgery?\n \n   Are there any types of sex or positions I should avoid when I start having sex again?\n \n   Will I be able to have children after surgery?\n \n  \n \n  Before radiation therapy, chemotherapy, targeted therapy, hormone therapy, or immunotherapy\n \n  If having radiation, chemo, hormone therapy, targeted therapy, or immunotherapy is in your treatment plan, here are some questions you might want to ask before treatment starts. Keep in mind not all of these questions are right for everyone. What questions you ask depend on your age, stage in life, relationship status, and the type of cancer and treatment you're getting. If you forget or don't think about asking questions before treatment, it's a good idea to ask them during your treatment visits or check-ups. It's also good to keep asking questions and following up on problems you've brought up at past visits. \n \n   \n   How soon will treatment start? \n \n   What side effects can I expect?\n \n   How will this treatment affect my appearance? \n \n   Will I lose my hair? If so, when and how much?\n \n   Will I gain or lose weight?\n \n   Can I exercise during treatment?\n \n   How might treatment affect my sex life? Will it affect my sexual desire, response, or function? What can be done about these effects?\n \n   Do I need to use birth control while I'm on treatment? For how long?\n \n   Does my partner need to use birth control while I'm on treatment? What about afterwards? For how long?\n \n   Can my cancer, medication, or treatment be passed to my partner through my body fluids?\n \n   What safety measures do I need to take, and for how long?\n \n   Will I be able to have children after treatment?\n \n  \n \n  During and after cancer treatment\n \n  Many times sexual problems or side effects that affect your sexuality happen during treatment, and might continue for a while afterward. It's important to know about precautions that might be needed at certain times. It's also important to report any side effects while you're getting treatment and during follow-up visits, as well as any changes you notice in sexual desire and function. Ask questions about them, because sometimes these problems come and go, and sometimes they can last. \n \n  Questions to ask during treatment might be related to sexual and protective precautions you're given, such as:\n \n   \n   If you are getting certain types of radiation therapy where is it unsafe to be physically close to your partner.\n \n   If you are getting certain types of chemo, targeted therapy, or immunotherapy that might be released in your body fluids, including sweat, saliva, and vaginal secretions.\n \n   If you are getting a treatment that might cause birth defects if you get pregnant.\n \n   If you have decreased numbers of white blood cells that cause you to have weakened immunity and make you more prone to infection.\n \n   If you have a decreased platelet count that can make you prone to easy bruising or bleeding. \n \n  \n \n  Other questions you might have during and after treatment could be related to:\n \n   \n   Problems you might be having in your sex life, such as vaginal pain or dryness, problems getting into a comfortable position, or lower sexual desire. \n \n   Side effects that might be affecting your sex life, such as anxiety, depression, sleep problems, fatigue, pain, numbness and tingling, nausea, or bowel or bladder problems. \n \n  \n \n  You probably have many other questions that haven’t been addressed here. If the questions you had before starting treatment were not asked or answered, or if you can't remember the answers you were given, ask them again. If you're not sure a problem you're having is related to your treatment, ask about it anyway. Don’t be afraid or embarrassed to discuss them with your doctor or other members of your cancer care team. Write them down so you’ll remember to ask them. Remember, if your cancer care team doesn't know about a problem you're having, and you don't ask about it, they can't help you manage it. \n \n   \n  \n \n  Getting professional help\n \n  Many health care professionals, including cancer doctors and nurses, have little training in sexuality issues. If your cancer specialist can’t help you, you can be examined by a  (a medical doctor trained in diseases of the female anatomy and reproductive system) with extra training in treating sexual problems.\n \n  When the most likely cause of a sexual problem is a hormone imbalance, a medical doctor called an  can be consulted. Endocrinologists are experts in the complex cycles and systems that control hormone levels. Usually your primary doctor is best able to decide if you need the special knowledge of an endocrinologist to solve your problem.\n \n  If your cancer specialist or family doctor is not able to help you, they can refer you for help. There are many different programs and specialists that can help you find the answers you need.\n \n  Sexual rehabilitation programs in cancer centers\n \n  A center that specializes in treating cancer may have experts on its staff that can assess and treat sexual problems. Ask your cancer care team what programs are offered or where you can go to get help.\n \n  Sex therapists and other types of counselors\n \n  Sex therapy is psychotherapy or counseling that's focused on solving a sexual problem. Sex therapists may practice in a clinic or alone. Look for a sex therapist who is a mental health professional (a psychiatrist, psychologist, social worker, or psychiatric clinical nurse specialist or nurse practitioner) with special training in treating sexual problems.\n \n  Finding a well-qualified mental health professional is important. These are some of the different types of mental health professionals out there:\n \n   \n    This is a medical doctor (an MD or DO) with a specialty in psychiatry. They should also be certified by the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology.\n \n    Most who are practicing alone have a doctorate in psychology (PhD or PsyD) or in education (EdD). Psychologists do not have medical degrees and don’t write prescriptions. Psychologists with a master’s degree are most often supervised by one with a doctorate. In most states a psychologist must be licensed. Those who practice usually have degrees in clinical or counseling psychology.\n \n    A social worker usually has master’s degree in social work (MSW). Licensing laws vary from state to state. Some states have a category for licensed psychotherapists called “marriage and family counselors.” They usually have a master’s degree in psychology or a related field, plus training in counseling.\n \n     These nurses have a master’s or doctorate degree in psychiatric nursing. They are licensed professionally, although their ability to prescribe medicines varies from state to state.\n \n  \n \n  The cost of counseling varies with the professional’s training and experience, and health insurance companies reimburse at different rates. You may want to check with your insurance company to find out if it will pay (and how much it will cover) for counseling or therapy.\n \n  Professional societies can often give you information about their members in your area who have special training in sex therapy. These are good places to start:\n \n   \n   American Association of Sex Educators, Counselors, and Therapists (AASECT) www.aasect.org\n \n  \n \n   \n   National Association of Social Workers (NASW) www.helpstartshere.org\n \n  \n \n  You can also get a listing of professionals in your area by contacting your state’s psychological association or a state association for licensed marriage and family therapists.\n"

        "text": "How Cancer and Cancer Treatment Can Affect Fertility\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n \n \n  \nWhat is fertility?\n \n  Fertility refers to having the ability to conceive, or being able to have a child. For females, fertility means they are able to become pregnant through normal sexual activity, and they are able to carry the baby through pregnancy. For males, fertility means they are able to father a child through normal sexual activity. A person's fertility depends on their reproductive organs working properly and other factors, such as when and how often they are having sex, certain hormones, and if their partner has any problems with fertility.\n \n  When a person cannot have a child, this is called , or being infertile. \n \n   \n   For females, infertility can mean they are not able to get pregnant through normal sexual activity or they have problems carrying a baby through a full-term pregnancy. \n \n   For males, infertility means they are not able to father a child through normal sexual activity. \n \n  \n \n  Doctors usually consider someone to be infertile if they haven't been able to conceive a child after 12 or more months of regular sexual activity, or after 6 months if the woman is more than 35 years old. \n \n  Problems with fertility can also be called  \nor \n. They happen when certain hormone levels are abnormally low or high or if sex organs are removed or aren't working properly. Some people never find out why they are having fertility problems. Many experts believe stress and anxiety can cause changes that play a part in infertility. \n \n  Fertility and cancer\n \n  Cancer – and treatment for cancer – can sometimes make having a child more difficult, or can raise doubts about whether having children is the right thing to do. People with certain types of cancer or those who are getting treatment for cancer may have these doubts or experience fertility problems. The problems might be caused by:\n \n   \n   A tumor directly damaging an organ or its surrounding tissue\n \n   Removing cancerous organs that normally would be needed to have a child (for example, cancer surgery might be needed to remove all or part of the testicles, penis, ovaries, uterus, or cervix.) \n \n   Certain treatments for cancer that can change hormone levels, put a woman into early menopause, damage nerves, or make certain sex organs stop working properly\n \n   Psychological or emotional responses, such as stress and anxiety\n \n  \n \n  Any of these situations can lead to serious concerns about fertility when treatment ends. \n \n  Fertility issues in children who have cancer\n \n  Children and teenagers who have cancer are often of special concern. This is because they might have surgery or get  treatments that can damage their growing and maturing organs, and some can affect their hormone and sexual development. Having these things happen in their younger years can affect fertility later in life. You can read more about this in Late Effects of Childhood Cancer Treatment.\n \n  Birth defects from cancer treatment\n \n  Sometimes fertility is not affected by cancer treatment, but there can be concern about birth defects if a pregnancy happens during or after treatment. Studies show there is a risk of birth defects when a woman becomes pregnant while getting or after receiving some types of chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and hormone therapy. In some cases, the risk can last for a long time, making getting pregnant a concern even years after treatment ends. In general, women are usually advised to not to get pregnant during treatment and may be told it's best not to get pregnant afterwards, depending on the treatment and situation. \n \n  The risk for birth defects when a man fathers a child during or after having treatment is not as clear. Many doctors advise men who are getting treatment to use birth control and not try to father a baby during treatment, just in case. \n \n  Talking about infertility when you have cancer\n \n  If fertility problems are possible, or there might be risks to having a baby after treatment, it's important to talk with the doctor and other members of the health care team about risks and available options. \n \n    Studies have found that doctors, nurses, and other members of a health care team don’t always ask about these problems during check-ups and treatment visits. Because of this, patients might not get enough information, support, or resources to help them deal with fertility problems. \n \n  Studies also show that many doctors and nurses don't know the right questions to ask about sexual orientation and gender identity. Many are not familiar with different terms that describe a person as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender (LGBT), or gender non-conforming (GNC). It's very important to let your cancer care team know your sexual orientation and gender identity, including what gender you were at birth and how you describe yourself now. Letting your cancer care team know this information will help you get the personalized care you need. \n \n   The cancer care team should talk about any possible fertility problems that might happen due to treatment as early as possible, either before surgery or before treatment starts. These conversations should consider your preferences, religious or personal beliefs, and the cost of available options. You might want to get a second opinion, or get a referral to a fertility or reproductive specialist.\n \n  For adult patients\n \n  Depending on your age, personal choices, family situation, and stage of life, being able to have a child (or another child) may be important to you. If so, be sure to talk to your cancer care team about how your cancer, any needed surgeries and procedures, and treatments and medications might affect your fertility. This includes letting them know what over-the-counter and prescription medications, vitamins, or supplements you may be taking because they might interfere with treatments.\n \n  Be as honest and open as possible, and ask questions so your cancer care team can help. Once a conversation has been started, it's easier to continue it and to bring it up again during your future check-ups.\n \n  Most importantly,talk with your partner about your concerns. Get as much information as you can, so you can decide together how to approach any fertility problems that are expected or might come up during and after treatment. If you are both comfortable with it, it might be a good idea to include your partner when talking with your health care team, too. \n \n  Talking to others, such as friends, family members, and other cancer survivors can be helpful. But, it's important to remember that everyone is different, and one person's experience may be very different from yours. Not everyone's cancer or treatment will affect them in the same way. Different types of cancer and treatments have different side effects, and effects on fertility can often depend on the patient's maturity and stage in life. How a body reacts can be better or worse depending on other health problems, too.\n \n  Your doctor may refer you to a counselor, therapist, or fertility specialist that can help you talk about options, and deal with some fears and worries about the effects of cancer on your fertility. \n \n  For parents of children with cancer\n \n  It's very important for parents of children, teenagers, and young adults to be told about effects on fertility soon after a diagnosis, and before treatment starts. Depending on the situation, options might be available to help preserve fertility. You can read more about this in Late Effects of Childhood Cancer Treatment.\n \n  For caregivers and partners\n \n  Concerns about fertility are often shared by people with cancer and their partners. Support is very important. Depending on the situation and your desire for having children, you can work together to find possible options for preserving fertility or for having a child once treatment ends. This can help to reassure the patient and help you both cope with the changes that are happening and challenges that lie ahead. Going with the patient to treatment and follow-up visits and check-ups might be a good idea, too. You might want to think about asking for a referral to a counselor, therapist, or fertility specialist. \n  \n  Before surgery or treatment \n \n  Parents of children with cancer, and adult patients and their partners need to know about possible fertility problems before having surgery and other treatments. Having these talks in advance can help know what to expect. But, studies show that not many cancer patients remember being told about fertility risks before surgery or treatment. Asking questions and getting honest answers can open up the opportunity for follow-up talks that lead to making informed decisions about care through the entire cancer journey and later in life.  \n \n  During cancer treatment \n \n  You may have concerns about fertility during treatment, or may notice changes in your body that you think might affect your ability to have children after treatment. It's important to keep talking to your health care team as you move into the treatment phase. Or, if you didn't talk about fertility before surgery or treatment, you can start talking about it during treatment-related visits, even if your doctor or nurse don't bring it up. Include your partner, if you're comfortable doing so. Remember, if your health care team doesn't know about a problem you're having, they can't help you manage it. \n \n  ﻿After cancer treatment \n \n  People who have finished cancer treatment may have lingering problems that affect fertility, and some might be lifelong. These can affect relationships, too. Be sure to continue reporting problems and asking questions during follow-up visits. If you are no longer managed by a cancer care team, be sure those providing health care for you are aware of problems you've had, what has helped or not helped, and other problems that might come up. Seeing a fertility specialist might be beneficial.\n \n  Palliative care \n \n  Palliative care can help address quality-of-life concerns. Ask members of a palliative care team to help manage fertility problems. This team of professionals can help manage symptoms at any time from the point of diagnosis, throughout treatment, and beyond for people living with a serious illness, such as cancer, no matter what stage it is.\n"

        "text": "How Cancer and Cancer Treatment Can Affect Fertility in Females\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n \n  \n  \nIt’s very important to talk to your cancer care team to know how a cancer surgery or treatment that's being recommended for you may affect your fertility  having the surgery or starting treatment. If these problems aren't talked about before surgery or treatment, it's important that they are brought up as soon as possible after surgery or when treatment starts. Read more about talking with your health care team in How Cancer and Cancer Treatment Can Affect Fertility. You need to be sure to get enough information, support, or resources to help you deal with any doubts, feelings, and expected fertility problems. \n \n  Fertility refers to having the ability to conceive, or being able to have a child. For females, fertility means they are able to become pregnant through normal sexual activity, and they are able to carry the baby through pregnancy. A person's fertility depends on their reproductive organs working properly and other factors, such as when and how often they are having sex, certain hormones, and if their partner has any problems with fertility.\n \n  When a person cannot have a child, this is called , or being infertile. For females, infertility can mean they are not able to get pregnant through normal sexual activity or they have problems carrying a baby through pregnancy. Doctors usually consider someone to be infertile if they haven't been able to conceive a child after 12 or more months of regular sexual activity, or after 6 months if the female is more than 35 years old. \n \n  Problems with fertility can also be called  \nor \n. They happen when certain hormone levels are abnormally low or high or if sex organs are removed or aren't working properly. Some people never find out why they are having fertility problems. Many experts believe stress and anxiety can cause changes that play a part in infertility. \n  \n  This information is for females with cancer. , please talk to your cancer care team about any needs that are not addressed here.\n \n  What can cause fertility problems \n \n  When a couple makes (conceives) a baby, this is called  \nor . When a baby is conceived naturally, a lot of things must take place for it to happen. For example, we know a female is born with all the eggs she will ever have and they’re stored in her ovaries. Any change in how the ovaries work, or a change in a hormone that's needed to release an egg from the ovary during monthly cycles (called ), can cause conception not to happen. In other words, there can be a “body system malfunction” that can change a woman's fertility and affect her ability to get pregnant and carry a child through a pregnancy. Certain health problems, including cancer, can affect these things. \n \n  Females can be diagnosed as infertile if:\n \n   \n   The ovaries don’t contain healthy eggs \n \n   Hormones that are needed to help with egg release are disrupted\n \n   A tumor or other problem might press on the ovaries or uterus (womb) and cause them not to work properly\n \n   Damage to other parts of the reproductive system prevents eggs from being released, fertilized, or implanted\n \n   A fertilized egg cannot grow inside the uterus\n \n   Something happens that won't allow a fetus (unborn child) to be carried through the full pregnancy, causing a miscarriage\n \n  \n \n  In many cases, cancer surgery or treatments can be more likely than cancer itself to interfere with some parts of the reproductive process and affect your ability to have children. Different types of surgeries and treatments can have different effects. The risk of infertility varies depending on:\n \n   \n   The patient’s age and stage of development; for example, before or after puberty, before or after menopause, etc.\n \n   The type and extent of surgery \n \n   The type of treatment given (radiation therapy, chemotherapy, hormone therapy, targeted therapy, immunotherapy, stem cell transplant) \n \n   The dose of treatment \n \n  \n            \n  Surgery\n \n  Surgery might be needed for a tumor that's in or near another reproductive organ, such as an ovary or fallopian tube, or the uterus or cervix. It might also be needed for a tumor that's in nearby abdominal (belly) or pelvic organs, such as the colon, rectum, or anus. There are some tumors that happen near the nervous system, such as the brain or spinal cord. These surgeries may affect a woman’s fertility.\n \n  Surgery to remove reproductive organs\n \n  A  is surgery to remove the uterus. Since an unborn child is carried in the uterus, once the uterus is removed, a woman cannot get pregnant. In females with cancer, removal of the uterus is done for uterine (endometrial) cancer, cervical cancer, and often for other cancers that affect the reproductive system. \n \n  An  \nis surgery to remove the ovaries. It might be done at the same time as a hysterectomy. Since ovaries hold a woman's eggs, a woman can’t get pregnant without them. For females with cancer, an oophorectomy is done for ovarian cancer, and often for other cancers that affect the reproductive system. If possible, and if there is a low risk that the cancer will come back, the surgeon might try to save one ovary to preserve eggs, which might still allow a woman to become pregnant. Keeping at least one ovary also preserves the hormones that help prevent menopause symptoms like hot flashes and vaginal dryness. Some women at high risk for breast, uterine, and ovarian cancers choose to have an oophorectomy as a means to help prevent the cancers from starting.\n \n  A  \nis surgery to remove the cervix (lower part of the uterus). It leaves the uterus behind so a woman has the chance to carry a pregnancy. \n \n  These surgeries can be done either through the vagina (laparoscopy) or through a cut (incision) made in the abdomen. You might hear people refer to a \"partial\" or \"total\" hysterectomy. This usually means the procedure only removes the uterus (partial) or it removes all reproductive organs (total). \n \n  Some women at high risk for breast, uterine, and ovarian cancers, or who have a hereditary cancer syndrome might choose to have a partial or total hysterectomy as a means to help prevent the cancers from starting.\n  \n  Sometimes other types of cancer surgery that's done for tumors in the abdomen or pelvis can cause scarring in and around reproductive organs. These are called . \nThey might block the ovaries, fallopian tubes, or uterus, preventing eggs from traveling to meet the sperm. This means the eggs can’t become fertilized and implant in the uterus.\n \n  Cancer Surgery gives you more information on surgery as a cancer treatment.\n \n  Radiation therapy\n \n  Radiation treatments use high-energy rays to kill cancer cells. Radiation that's aimed at or around a woman’s reproductive organs can affect fertility.\n \n  Radiation to the pelvis area\n \n  Radiation that's aimed at or around the ovaries damages them enough to affect their function. Even if the radiation is not aimed right at the ovaries, the rays can be absorbed and might still damage the ovaries. When radiation is directed inside the vagina, the ovaries absorb a high dose of radiation.\n \n  For a woman getting radiation therapy to the abdomen (belly) or pelvis, the amount of radiation absorbed by the ovaries will determine if she becomes infertile. High doses can destroy some or all of the eggs in the ovaries and might cause infertility or early menopause. Most women getting pelvic radiation will lose their fertility. But, some eggs might survive if the ovaries are moved further from the target area in a minor surgery to preserve them that might be able to be done before radiation begins.\n \n  Radiation to the uterus can cause scarring, which decreases flexibility and blood flow to the uterus. It also makes the uterus unable to stretch to full size during pregnancy. These problems can limit the growth and expansion of the uterus during pregnancy. Women who have had radiation to the uterus have an increased risk of miscarriage, low-birth weight infants, and premature births. These problems are most likely in women who had radiation during childhood, before the uterus began to grow during puberty.\n \n  Radiation to the brain\n \n  Sometimes radiation to the brain affects the pituitary gland. The pituitary gland normally signals the ovaries to make hormones, so interfering with these signals can affect ovulation (the release of eggs from the ovaries). This might or might not affect fertility depending on the focus and dose of the radiation.\n \n  Some females may be fertile when starting radiation treatments. If you are fertile or you think you might be, it’s important to talk to your doctor about your risk for infertility before treatment starts.\n \n  Radiation can harm a fetus. So, if you are fertile and your fertility might not be affected by radiation treatments, it's also important to talk about how long you should wait to resume unprotected sexual activity or to try for a pregnancy. Your doctor will be able to consider your circumstances and give you specific information about how long you should wait to try to get pregnant.\n \n  You can get more details about this type of treatment in Radiation Therapy.\n \n  Chemotherapy \n   \n \n  A female is born with all the eggs she will have. As she moves through puberty, hormones allow mature eggs to be released every month during the menstrual cycle until the female reaches menopause and the hormonal cycles eventually stop.  Chemotherapy (chemo) works by killing cells in the body that are dividing quickly. The hormones, such as estrogen, needed to release eggs each month and prepare the uterus for a possible pregnancy are made in the cells of the ovaries (oocytes). Oocytes tend to divide quickly, so are often affected by chemo. This can lead to loss of those important hormones and can affect fertility. Sometimes a woman will go into premature or early menopause. \n \n  Fertility depends on the female’s stage in life (before or after puberty, before or after menopause), menstrual history, hormone levels, the type of cancer and treatment, and the treatment doses. Because all these factors need to be considered, it can be hard to predict if a woman is likely to be fertile after chemo.\n \n  Chemo drugs that are linked to the risk of infertilityin females are:\n   \n \n   \n   Busulfan\n \n   Carboplatin\n \n   Carmustine \n \n   Chlorambucil\n \n   Cisplatin\n \n   Cyclophosphamide\n \n   Cytosine arabinoside\n \n   Doxorubicin \n \n   Ifosfamide\n \n   Lomustine\n \n   Melphalan\n \n   Mitomycin-C\n \n   Nitrogen mustard (mechlorethamine)\n \n   Procarbazine\n \n   Temozolomide\n \n   Thiotepa\n \n   Vinblastine\n \n   Vincristine\n \n  \n \n  Higher doses of these drugs are more likely to cause permanent fertility changes, and combinations of drugs can have greater effects. The risks of permanent infertility are even higher when females are treated with both chemo and radiation therapy to the belly (abdomen) or pelvis.\n \n  Some other chemo drugs that have a  of causing infertility in females include:\n \n   \n   5-fluorouracil (5-FU)\n \n   6-mercaptopurine (6-MP)\n \n   Bleomycin\n \n   Cytarabine\n \n   Dactinomycin\n \n   Daunorubicin\n \n   Epirubicin\n \n   Etoposide (VP-16)\n \n   Fludarabine\n \n   Gemcitabine\n \n   Idarubicin\n \n   Methotrexate\n \n  \n   \n  Talk to your doctor about the chemo drugs you will get and the fertility risks that come with them. \n   \n \n  Chemo and pregnancy\n \n  There are things that cause a female to have a higher risk for infertility, and others that might not affect fertility at all. Here are some examples:\n \n   \n   The younger you are, the more eggs you usually have in your ovaries. This gives you a higher chance to keep some fertility in spite of damage from treatments. Women who are treated for cancer before they are 35 have the best chance of becoming pregnant after treatment. Depending on the treatment they are getting, some women in their teens or twenties never stop having periods until they reach menopause. Young women who stop having menstrual periods during treatment may have a return of periods again after they are off chemo for a while.\n \n    After chemo, fertility may not last as long as it would if treatment wasn't needed. Girls who had chemo before puberty (the time when periods begin) or young women whose menstrual periods start back after chemo are at risk for early (premature) menopause. When a woman stops having periods before age 40, it’s considered or . \n She becomes infertile because her ovaries stop making the hormones needed for fertility. Of course, females who have had surgery to remove reproductive organs cannot get pregnant. \n \n    Even if a woman’s periods start back after cancer treatment has stopped, her fertility is still uncertain. A fertility expert might be needed to help find out if you are fertile or learn how long the fertility window may last.\n \n  \n \n  If you are fertile or think you might be fertile, it's very important to avoid getting pregnant during chemo. Many chemo drugs can hurt a developing fetus, causing birth defects or other harm. Some can contribute to having a miscarriage. Some women remain fertile during chemo, so it's best to use very effective birth control.  Remember, too, that some women can get pregnant even when their periods have stopped. For this reason, it’s important to use birth control whether or not you have periods, but talk to your cancer care team about what's best for your situation.\n \n  If you remain fertile through treatment and want to get pregnant after it ends, be sure you know how long you should wait before trying. Studies about this are hard to find, but some suggest getting pregnant too soon after chemo can harm the fetus, cause birth defects, or cause a woman to miscarry\n \n  See Chemotherapy for more information.\n \n  Hormone therapy\n \n  Hormone therapies are often used to treat breast cancer or other cancers. These can affect your ability to have a child. Some of these drugs, such as tamoxifen, might not cause problems getting pregnant, but can cause birth defects. Other hormone therapies may block or suppress hormones, causing infertility by putting a woman into early menopause. This may be temporary or permanent, depending on the type and length of treatment. \n \n  It’s always best to talk to your cancer care team about your treatment and any possible effects on your sexual function and fertility. It's also very important to talk about whether you need to use birth control during and after treatment. \n \n  Targeted therapy and immunotherapy\n \n  Targeted therapy and immunotherapy drugs attack cancer cells differently from standard chemo drugs. Little is known about their effects on fertility or problems during pregnancy. It's very important to talk to your doctor about any targeted or immunotherapy drugs you will get, and the fertility risks that might come with them, and any precautions that might be needed. Some information is known, such as:\n \n   \n   Bevacizumab (Avastin) can cause ovarian failure, and some women’s ovaries never recover.\n \n   Some targeted drugs (thalidomide and lenalidomide) have such a high danger of causing  that women are asked to use  effective types of birth control while taking them. \n \n   Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs)  have caused birth defects in lab animals.\n \n  \n \n  See Targeted Therapy and Immunotherapy to learn more about these cancer treatments.\n  \n  Bone marrow or stem cell transplant\n \n  Having a bone marrow or stem cell transplant usually involves receiving high doses of chemo and sometimes radiation to the whole body before the procedure. In most cases, this permanently stops ovaries from releasing eggs, resulting in lifelong infertility. Talk with your doctor or nurse about this risk before starting treatment. (See Chemotherapy and Radiation Therapy for more on these parts of the transplant process.) If you'd like to learn more, see Stem Cell Transplant.\n"

        "text": "Preserving Fertility in Females with Cancer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n \n \n  \nCertain cancers and their treatment can affect fertility in males and females. Read more about this in How Cancer and Cancer Treatment Can Affect Fertility. When a person with cancer wants to have children after treatment ends, some planning is needed. Sometime this involves . Fertility preservation is when eggs, sperm, or reproductive tissue are saved or protected so that a person can use them to have children in the future.\n \n  This information is for females with cancer. , please talk to your cancer care team about any needs that are not addressed here.\n \n   Fertility preservation for females with cancer\n \n  Certain types of cancer surgery can result in removal of organs needed for a pregnancy, and certain treatments might change hormone levels or cause damage to a female's eggs. These effects result in some females losing their fertility during treatment that can be either temporary or permanent. Read more in How Cancer and Cancer Treatment Affect Can Fertility in Females. Some women may choose to take steps that might help preserve their fertility so they can try to have children after treatment.\n       \n  It's best that discussions about preserving fertility take place before cancer surgery happens or before treatments begin.   They don’t always remember to bring this up, so you might have to bring it up yourself. \n \n  If you are considering taking steps to preserve your fertility, and it's possible to do so, be sure that you understand the risks and chances of success of any fertility option you are interested in, and keep in mind that no method works 100% of the time. \n \n  It's also very important to talk to your cancer care team about if you can have unprotected sex both during and after cancer treatment. They may recommend waiting a number of months or longer before trying to have a child by natural means or until resuming unprotected sexual intercourse.\n \n  Experts recommend doctors who are part of the cancer care team be involved in talking about fertility with patients, including medical oncologists, radiation oncologists, gynecologic oncologists, urologists, hematologists, pediatric oncologists, surgeons, nurses, and others. The experts have the following recommendations:\n \n   \n   The cancer care team should talk about any possible fertility problems that might happen due to treatment as early as possible, either before surgery or before treatment starts.\n \n   Patients who are interested in fertility preservation, might be thinking about it, or want to learn more, should be referred to a reproductive specialist.\n \n   The cancer care team should start talking about preserving fertility as early as possible, too, meaning before treatment starts.\n \n   Referrals to counseling should be made for people who may be anxious or distressed about fertility-related effects.\n \n  \n \n  Learn more about how you can start talking about fertility with your cancer care team in How Cancer and Cancer Treatment Can Affect Fertility.\n \n  Possible natural pregnancy\n \n  In females who were fertile before treatment, the body may recover naturally after treatment. It may be able to keep or restore normal hormonal cycles. and produce mature eggs that can be fertilized and implanted into the uterus to become a fetus. The medical team may recommend waiting anywhere from 6 months to 2 years before trying to get pregnant. Waiting 6 months may reduce the risk of birth defects from eggs damaged by chemotherapy or other treatments. The 2-year period is generally based on the fact that the risk of the cancer coming back (recurring) is usually highest in the first 2 years after treatment. The length of time depends on the type of cancer and the treatment used.\n \n  But women who have had chemo or radiation to the pelvis are also at risk for sudden, early menopause even after they start having menstrual cycles again. Menopause may start 5 to 20 years earlier than expected. Because of this, women should talk to their doctors about how long they should wait to try to conceive and why they should wait. It’s best to have this discussion before going on with a pregnancy plan.\n  \n  Cryopreservation (freezing embryos or eggs)\n \n  Experts recommend freezing embryos or eggs, called ,\n to help preserve fertility for certain females with cancer. It's important to find a fertility specialist and center that has experience in these procedures. \n \n  The process of collecting eggs for embryo and egg freezing are the same. However, the timing can be different. Collecting eggs for embryo cryopreservation typically takes several days or weeks, depending on where a woman is in her menstrual cycle. Injectable hormone medications are given for females when they are safe to give. For egg cryopreservation, the time of the menstrual cycle is not as important. For both procedures, a catheter is put through the upper part of the vagina and into the ovary to collect the eggs.\n   \n \n  Costs vary for these procedures, so check with your insurance company about coverage and ask the fertility specialist what costs are involved with the process. Sometimes these costs can be $10,000 or more each time they are done which may or may not include storage fees. Be sure to ask for a list of all fees and charges, since these differ from one center to another.\n \n  If you have frozen eggs, embryos, or ovarian tissue, it’s important to stay in contact with the cryopreservation facility to be sure that any yearly storage fees are paid and your address is updated.\n \n  Embryo freezing\n \n  Embryo freezing, or embryo cryopreservation, is an effective way to help preserve fertility for females. Mature eggs are removed from the female and put in a sterile lab dish with several thousand sperm. The goal is for one of the sperm to then fertilize the egg. This is called fertilization (IVF).  (IVF-ICSI) involves taking a single sperm and injecting it directly into an egg to fertilize it. In both IVF and IVF-ICSI, the lab dish is observed and if the egg is fertilized, the embryo can be frozen. Later, after treatment ends and the woman is ready to try to get pregnant, the embryo is thawed and put back into the female's uterus to try to achieve a pregnancy. \n \n  A woman’s age and menopause status plays a large role in the chances of pregnancy, with a younger age at the time of egg retrieval resulting in higher potential for pregnancy.  The quality of the embryos also makes a difference. Some may not survive the thawing process. Some may not implant into the uterus correctly. \n \n  Egg (oocyte) freezing\n \n  Egg freezing (or oocyte cryopreservation) is also an effective way to help preserve fertility for women, although it has not been used as long as embryo freezing (described above). This may be a good choice for women who do not have a partner, do not want to use donor sperm to make a fertilized embryo, or if they have a religious conflict with freezing a fertilized embryo. \n \n  For egg freezing, mature eggs are removed from the female and frozen before being fertilized with sperm. This process might also be called . When the woman is ready to try to become pregnant, the eggs can then be thawed, fertilized by a partner's or donor's sperm, and implanted in her uterus to try to achieve pregnancy. \n \n  Ovarian tissue freezing\n \n  This procedure is still experimental. It involves all or part of one ovary being removed by laparoscopy (a minor surgery where a thin, flexible tube is passed through a small cut near the navel to reach and look into the pelvis). The ovarian tissue is usually cut into small strips, frozen, and stored. After cancer treatment, the ovarian tissue can be thawed and placed in the pelvis (transplanted). Once the transplanted tissue starts to function again, the eggs can be collected and attempts to fertilize them can be done in the lab.\n \n  Ovarian tissue removal does not usually require a hospital stay. It can be done either before or after puberty.\n \n  \n     \n  \n  \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  Ovarian transposition\n \n  Ovarian transposition means moving the ovaries away from the target zone of radiation treatment. It’s a standard option for girls or young females who are going to get pelvic radiation. It can be used either before or after puberty.\n \n  This procedure can often be done as outpatient surgery and does not require staying in the hospital (unless it is being done as part of a larger operation). Surgeons will usually move the ovaries above and to the side of the central pelvic area. It’s usually best to do the procedure just before starting radiation therapy, since they tend to fall back into their normal position over time.\n \n  The success rates for this procedure vary. Because of radiation scatter, ovaries are not always protected, and patients should be aware that this technique is not always successful.\n \n  It’s hard to estimate the costs of ovarian transposition, since this procedure may sometimes be done during another surgery that is covered by insurance. \n \n  Fertility-sparing surgery\n \n  For early-stage cervical cancer, the surgeon can sometimes remove the cervix (trachelectomy) without removing the entire uterus or ovaries. For early-stage ovarian cancer that only affects one ovary, the surgeon might be able to remove the one ovary that's affected and not the other. Both of these procedures can help preserve fertility. See the images below for more information. \n \n  Ovarian suppression\n \n  Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists are long-acting hormone drugs that can be used to make a woman go into menopause for a short time. This is called ovarian suppression. The goal of this treatment is to shut down the ovaries during cancer treatment to help protect them from damaging effects. The hope is that reducing activity in the ovaries during treatment will reduce the number of eggs that are damaged, so women might be able to resume normal menstrual cycles after treatment. But, studies are not clear on the effects of this treatment as a way to preserve fertility. Experts do not recommend using ovarian suppression instead of cryopreservation or other proven fertility preservation methods.\n     \n  \n  The cost for the hormone injections can be high, and the drugs can weaken bones depending on how long they are used.  Because the drugs put a female into menopause, the most common side effect is hot flashes.\n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n    \n \n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n \n \n  \nProgesterone therapy for early-stage uterine cancer\n \n  Younger women sometimes have endometrial hyperplasia (pre-cancerous changes in the cells that line the uterus) or an early-stage, slow-growing cancer of the lining of the uterus (adenocarcinoma). The usual treatment would be hysterectomy (surgery to remove the uterus). However, women with stage 1, Grade 1 endometrial cancer who still want to have a child might have the option to be treated instead with the hormone progesterone, via an intrauterine device (IUD) or as a pill. Many will go on to have removal of the uterus, fallopian tubes, and both ovaries after giving birth. Since they also have a high risk of ovarian cancer, many oncologists believe young women with uterine cancer should not freeze ovarian tissue and put it back into their bodies later on.\n \n  Options for women who are not fertile after cancer treatment\n \n  Donor eggs\n \n  Using donor eggs is an option for women who have a healthy uterus and are cleared by their doctors to carry a pregnancy but cannot conceive with their own eggs.  The process involves in vitro \nfertilization (IVF) (see above).\n \n  Donated eggs come from women who have volunteered to go through a cycle of hormone stimulation and have their eggs collected. In the United States, donors can be known or anonymous. They can be paid or unpaid. Some women have a sister, cousin, or close friend who is willing to donate her eggs without payment. There are also frozen egg banks available from which women can purchase frozen eggs that are then sent to a fertility center for IVF.\n \n  Per regulations, egg donors are carefully screened for sexually transmitted infections and genetic diseases. Every egg donor should also be screened by a mental health professional familiar with the egg donation process. These screenings are just as important for donors who are friends or family members. For known donors, everyone also needs to agree on what the donor’s relationship with the child will be, and be certain that the donor was not pressured emotionally or financially to donate her eggs. \n \n  The success of the egg donation depends on carefully timing hormone treatment (to prepare the lining of the uterus, if it's safe to give) to be ready for an embryo to be placed inside. The eggs are taken from the donor and fertilized with the sperm. Embryos are then transferred to the recipient to produce pregnancy. Continued hormone support might be needed until the placenta develops and can produce its own hormones.\n \n  It’s important that you research the experience and success rates of the IVF or fertility center you may use. \n \n  Donor embryos\n \n  A woman who has a healthy uterus and can maintain a pregnancy may be given the option to have in vitro fertilization (IVF) (see above) with donor embryos. These donated fertilized eggs do not have sperm or the egg of the couple trying to get pregnant. This approach lets a couple experience pregnancy and birth together, but neither parent will have a genetic relationship to the child. Embryo donations usually come from a couple who has had IVF and has extra frozen embryos. \n \n  One problem with this option is that the couple donating the embryo may not agree to have the same types of genetic testing as is usually done for egg or sperm donors, and they may not want to supply a detailed health history. On the other hand, the embryos are usually free, so the cost to the cancer survivor involves the process to make the uterus ready to accept the embryo and having the embryo placed. But, there can be legal and medical fees that mount up.\n \n   \n   Most women who use the donor embryo procedure must get hormone treatments to prepare the lining of the uterus and ensure the best timing of the embryo transfer. So, they must be able to safely take hormones. \n \n   It’s important that you research the experience and success rates of any IVF or fertility center you may use. \n \n  \n \n  Surrogacy\n \n  Surrogacy is an option for women who cannot carry a pregnancy, either because they no longer have a working uterus, or would be at high risk for a health problem if they got pregnant. There are 2 types of surrogate mothers: \n \n   \n   A  is a healthy female who receives the embryos created from the egg and sperm of the intended parents or from egg or sperm donors. The gestational carrier does not contribute her own egg to the embryo and has no genetic relationship to the baby. \n \n   A is usually a woman who becomes pregnant through artificial insemination with the sperm of the male in the couple (or a sperm donor) who will raise the child. She gives her egg (which is fertilized with his sperm in the lab), and carries the pregnancy. She is the genetic mother of the baby. \n \n  \n \n  Surrogacy can be a legally complicated and expensive process. Surrogacy laws vary, so it’s important to have an attorney help you make the legal arrangements with your surrogate. You should consider the laws of the state where the surrogate lives, the state where the child will be born, and the state where you live. It’s also very important that the surrogate mother be evaluated and supported by an expert mental health professional as part of the process. Very few surrogacy agreements go sour, but when they do, typically this step was left out.\n \n  Adoption\n \n  Adoption is usually an option for many people who want to become a parent. Adoption can take place within your own country through a public agency or by a private arrangement, or internationally through private agencies. Foster care systems and other agencies specialize in placing children with special needs, older children, or siblings.\n \n  Many adoption agencies or foster care systems state that they do not rule out cancer survivors as potential parents. But they may require you to be done with treatment, and likely will need some information about your type of cancer and quality of life. You may be able to find an agency that has experience working with cancer survivors. Cancer survivors have some legal protections (including against discrimination during adoption proceedings) under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). \n \n  There’s a lot of paperwork to complete during the adoption process, and at times it can seem overwhelming. Many couples find it helpful to attend adoption or parenting classes before adopting. These classes can help you understand the adoption process and give you a chance to meet other couples in similar situations. The process takes different lengths of time depending on the type of adoption you choose.\n \n  Costs of adopting vary greatly, from around $6,000 (for a public agency, foster care, or special needs adoption) up to $35,000 to $50,000 (for private U.S. and some international adoptions, including travel costs).\n \n  You might be able to find an agency that has experience working with cancer survivors. Some discrimination clearly does occur both in domestic and international adoption. Yet, most cancer survivors who want to adopt can do so.\n \n  Child-free living\n \n  Many couples, with or without cancer, decide they prefer not to have children. Child-free living allows a couple to pursue other life goals, such as career, travel, or volunteering in ways that help others. If you are unsure about having children, talk with your spouse or partner. If you are having trouble agreeing on the future, talking with a counselor or mental health professional may help you both think more clearly about the issues and make the best decision.\n"

        "text": " Fever\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n \n \n  \n \n   A fever is a body temperature that is higher than normal. But, a normal temperature in one person might be different from a normal temperature in another person. This is why it's important to find out what your cancer care team thinks might be a fever for you. They will tell you what temperature you should consider higher than normal. \n \n   Fever is usually caused by an infection. Other causes of fever may include inflammation, medication reactions, or tumor growth. Sometimes, the cause might not be known or easy to find. In an infection, the fever is a result of your body trying to fight invading germs. Fever is an important natural defense against germs.\n \n   People getting cancer treatments have a higher risk for infections because cancer treatment can cause neutropenia, a condition in which you have fewer white blood cells than normal to help fight infections.  \n \n   To know if you have a fever, you will need to take your temperature. To take your temperature, you will need a thermometer. Ask your cancer care team what kind of thermometer is best. You can buy an easy-to-use oral thermometer (one made to take your temperature by mouth) at any drugstore so you can check to see if you have a fever. If you have any of the following symptoms, it is important that you take your temperature:\n  \n    \n    Increased skin temperature\n \n    Feeling warm\n \n    Feeling tired\n \n    Headache\n \n    Feeling cold\n \n    Shaking chills\n \n    Body aches\n \n    Skin rashes\n \n    Any new area of redness or swelling\n \n    Pus or yellowish discharge from an injury or other location\n \n    New cough or shortness of breath\n \n    New belly pain\n \n    Burning or pain when urinating \n \n    Sore throat\n \n    You are confused, forgetful, aren’t making sense, or can’t tell  where you are.\n \n   \n \n   Neutropenic fever\n \n   You may have heard your cancer care team talk about neutropenic fever. \n     In patients with neutropenia, fever may often be the first and sometimes only sign of infection. If this happens, your cancer care team will assess you and likely start treatment\n      for infection right away. Treatment of a patient with neutropenic fever usually means starting the patient on antibiotics before they take tests\n      that will confirm an infection.\n \n   What the patient can do\n \n    \n    If you start feeling warm or cold, check your temperature by mouth every 2 to 3 hours. If you can’t hold a thermometer in your mouth\n     , hold it under your arm, in your armpit. Call your cancer care team if you have a fever (your cancer care team will tell you the temperature they consider a fever). Someone on the team will let you know if you need to be seen right away or if you need to wait and keep monitoring your temperature.\n \n    Keep a record of temperature readings.\n \n    Drink a lot of liquids (such as water, fruit juices, ice pops, and soups).\n \n    Get enough rest.\n \n    Use a cold compress on your forehead if you feel hot.\n \n    Do not take medication to reduce your fever without asking your doctor. Remember that medication to reduce a fever will only help reduce your temperature - it will not take away an infection.\n \n   \n \n   What caregivers can do\n \n    \n    Watch for shaking chills, and check the patient’s temperature after the shaking stops.\n \n    Check the patient’s temperature by placing the thermometer in the mouth or in their armpit. (Do not take the temperature rectally unless you’ve been told it’s OK). If the patient has a fever, call the cancer care team for instructions on whether to be seen right away or to continue monitoring the fever.\n \n    Offer extra fluids and snacks.\n \n    Help the patient take their medicines on schedule.\n \n    Encourage visitors who have a fever, diarrhea, a cough, or the flu to visit the patient only by phone until they are well again.\n"

It's important to know that other non-cancer problems and medicines can also cause them or increase the risk for them.\n \n  Hiccups\n \n  Hiccups (or hiccoughs) are spasms that affect a muscle between your lungs and stomach that is used when you breathe, called the . A hiccup happens when the diaphragm is irritated and suddenly contracts between normal breaths.\n \n  Hiccups can be caused by irritation of the nerve that controls the diaphragm which can happen for different reasons, such as:\n \n   \n   Certain chemotherapy drugs used to treat cancer\n \n   Other drugs that may or may not be taken for cancer-related problems, including steroids, anti-nausea medicines, and antibiotics\n \n   Nerve or brain injuries\n \n   Fluid in the lungs or near the heart\n \n   Bloating and gas in the stomach area\n \n   Low levels of certain electrolytes (blood chemistries) such as sodium, calcium, and potassium\n \n   High blood sugar level\n \n   Problems in the esophagus (the swallowing tube that goes from the throat to the stomach)\n \n   Tumors or blockages in the esophagus, lungs, liver, pancreas, kidney, or colon\n \n   Changes in temperature\n \n   Stress and excitement\n \n   Drinking certain types of liquids or eating certain foods.\n \n  \n \n  In people with cancer, certain chemotherapy drugs can have hiccups as a side effect, \n \n  Hiccups are usually temporary and stop within minutes to hours. If hiccups last more than 2 days, they can be considered ; they are considered  if they last more than a month. Hiccups that last a long time can be a sign of a serious problem.\n \n  Managing hiccups\n \n  There is a medication that can be prescribed to help manage hiccups if needed. But usually they are very temporary and stop without any kind of treatment. There’s not a lot of research about ways to manage hiccups other than using medication your doctor prescribes, but here are some things people have found useful.\n \n   \n   Breathe slowly and deeply into a paper bag for 10 breaths at a time.\n \n   Drink water slowly.\n \n   Bear down gently as if having a bowel movement (called the Valsalva maneuver).\n \n   Hold a teaspoon of sugar in your mouth and then swallow.\n \n   Avoid forcing yourself to eat.\n \n  \n  \n  Heartburn\n \n  Heartburn is a burning sensation in the throat, chest, or upper abdominal (belly) area that often worsens after eating or when you lay down. Some people might notice it more in the evening or after going to bed at night. It's sometimes called  or . It's a common problem from having too much acid in the stomach that forces contents of the stomach up into the esophagus.\n \n  If heartburn happens frequently it is often called or diagnosed as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).  Sometimes, several years of heartburn can lead to ulcers or Barrett's esophagus which is linked to an increased risk of cancer of the esophagus.\n \n  Causes of heartburn include:\n \n   \n   Increased production of stomach acid\n \n   Drinking too much alcohol, caffeine, acidic juices, or carbonated beverages\n \n   Treatments for cancer, such as certain chemotherapy drugs and radiation to the chest or upper abdomen\n \n   Taking certain medications, such as aspirin and anti-inflammatories (Advil, Motrin, Aleve, ibuprofen)\n \n   Eating high-fat foods\n \n   Smoking\n \n   Being obese\n \n   Blockages or changes in structure of the esophagus due to narrowing or tumor growth\n \n  \n \n  \n  \n  Managing heartburn\n \n  Your health care team may prescribe an over-the-counter antacid to help with heartburn. There are other  medications that might be prescribed short-term. Talk with your health care team if you have heartburn, and if any recommended or prescribed medications are not working.\n  \n   \n  \n  \n   \n   Avoid tobacco\n \n   Limit caffeine and alcohol\n \n   If you are overweight, losing weight may help relieve symptoms\n \n   Eat small rather than big meals\n \n   Avoid eating less than 2 to 3 hours before bedtime\n \n  \n \n  What caregivers can do for hiccups and heartburn\n \n   \n   Watch the patient to be sure that they’re able to drink enough liquid.\n \n   Elevate the head of the bed for comfort.\n \n   If medicine is given, watch for dizziness. The patient may need help getting up or walking.\n \n  \n \n  Call the health care team if the patient\n \n   \n   Has nausea that isn't managed even after taking medication\n \n   Has trouble breathing, eating, or swallowing\n \n   Has heartburn and develops a puffy or bloated stomach or constipation\n"

They happen when your body tries to lower its temperature. They can happen even when the area around you or the room you're in is cool. \n \n    \n     is also known as perspiring.  Sweat, or perspiration, is the fluid created by the sweat glands in the body when heat is given off through skin. \n \n     can cause sweating which can range from mild to excessive. Sometimes these are called hot flushes. \n \n     are sweating and hot flashes that mostly happen when you're sleeping . \n \n   \n \n   Sweating\n \n   Sweating is your body's way to lower its temperature. It normally happens when your body is exposed to heat, after exercise, because of hormone changes, or when people are feeling anxious and stressed. If you are sick, having a fever can also cause sweating. In people with cancer, sweating can also be caused by a fever, a tumor, or cancer treatment.\n   \n   Hot flashes\n \n   Hot flashes involve sweating, but can be described as a sensation of heat or flushing. They might include flushing in the face or  may be described as heat in other areas of the body. People who have hot flashes describe them as ranging from feeling just a sensation of warmth with mild sweat to having chills and enough perspiration to soak your clothes or bedding. If hot flashes are moderate to severe, sometimes you might have problems sleeping and fatigue, too.\n \n   Hot flashes often normally occur in women because of hormone changes during menopause. In women being treated with hormone therapy for breast cancer, hot flashes can have  different severity and can be long-lasting.\n \n   Hot flashes can also occur in women being treated for other cancers with methods known to have early menopause or temporary hormone changes as a side effect. These hot flashes might be temporary or long-lasting depending on the treatment given.\n \n   Men being treated for prostate cancer who have surgery and androgen suppression therapy may have hot flashes for a period of time that might eventually go away. If your treatment plan includes any of these treatments or if you are having hot flashes, talk to your cancer care team so they can assess your specific situation.\n \n   What to look for\n \n    \n    Feeling unusually hot in one or more areas of your body.\n \n    Having wet or damp skin any time of day, including during the night or waking up to find sheets damp.\n \n    Fever followed by heavy sweating as the body temperature goes back down\n \n    Chilling or shaking chills\n \n    Drenching sweats even when there’s no fever or the area around you doesn't seem overly hot.\n"

Managing them also means helping the patient feel more comfortable and finding ways to relieve them. Talk to your cancer care team about the right treatment for you.\n \n  Medications\n \n  How hot flashes and sweating are managed depends on what's causing them. Sometimes medications can be used and sometimes lifestyle changes might help. These can be classified as either non-hormone therapy and hormone therapy. Because every patient is different, it's important to talk to your cancer care team about what is best for your situation. \n \n  Non-hormone therapy\n \n   \n   Prescription medications: low doses of certain anti-depressant and high blood pressure medications have been shown to help control hot flashes\n \n   Over-the-counter medications, such as fever reducers or mild pain relievers that are recommended by your cancer care team. \n \n   Therapies, such as massage, acupuncture, yoga, and cognitive behavioral interventions.\n \n   Lifestyle changes, such as increased physical activity, weight management, and avoiding alcohol and tobacco.\n \n  \n \n  Hormone therapy\n \n  Medication to replace hormones that have decreased because of surgery or other treatment may be prescribed. This depends on the type and stage of cancer you have, as well as other tests that are done on your tumor when it's diagnosed.  It's important to talk with your doctor about your situation, about the pros and cons of taking these drugs, and the side effects they might cause if your treatment plan includes them.\n \n  There are vitamins, minerals, and other supplements that claim to help with sweating and hot flashes. Some can be helpful, but it's important to talk with your doctor about whether they are safe for you to take. \n \n  What the patient can do\n \n  Take medicine to reduce fever, such as acetaminophen (Tylenol), if your health care team says it's ok for you to do so. Depending on what is causing your sweating or hot flashes, there may be different ways you can help to manage them.\n \n   \n   Take all medications as prescribed.\n \n   Talk to your doctor before trying any over-the-counter medicine, or any vitamin, mineral, or nutritional supplement that you think might help.\n \n   Talk to your doctor if your anti-perspirant or deodorant is not working well. \n \n   Track episodes of sweating and hot flashes.\n \n   If your sweating is from fevers, take and track your temperature as instructed.\n \n   Dress in 2 layers of clothing in cooler temperatures. The layer on the inside will act as a wick to pull moisture up and away from the skin. The layers on the outside can be removed as needed.\n \n   Change wet clothes and bed linens as soon as you can.\n \n  \n \n   \n   Take good care of your skin and use good personal hygiene. For example, if you’re sweating a lot, bathe or shower at least once a day and put on a moisturizer as needed to soothe your skin and for good hygiene.\n \n  \n \n  What caregivers can do\n \n   \n   Help the patient take and track their temperature, if needed.\n \n   Help the patient keep track of any sweating episodes.\n \n   Help the patient change wet clothes and bed linens.\n \n   Check the patient’s temperature by mouth a few times a day and in the evening.\n \n   Offer extra liquids to replace the fluid that’s lost through sweat.\n \n   Offer to help the patient bathe or shower if needed.\n \n  \n \n  Call the cancer care team if the patient\n \n   \n   Becomes dehydrated from frequent soaking sweats\n \n   Has fever of 100.5° F or higher than usual for them or higher than a level instructed by the cancer care team (when taken by mouth) for more than 24 hours\n \n   Has tremors or shaking chills that last\n \n  \n  \n   \n   \n \n\n\n",

        "text": "Causes of Infections (Germs)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n \n \n  \nInfection is one of the most common complications of cancer and cancer treatment. This is because cancer and cancer treatments can weaken the immune system for a period of time. The immune system is a group of organs, tissues, and cells that work together to resist and fight infections. Some infections can spread to other parts of the body and might become life-threatening if not found early. Infections are caused by germs  that enter the body, multiply, and cause harm or illness. The main types of germs that can cause infections are: \n \n   \n   Bacteria\n \n   Viruses\n \n   Protozoa (some of which act as parasites)\n \n   Fungal organisms (also called fungi).\n \n  \n \n  Certain types of cancer itself can increase your risk of getting an infection. So can certain types of cancer treatment. Once the cancer cells are treated and treatment is over, the risk of infection usually goes back down. For most people with cancer, the greatest risk of getting a serious infection only lasts for a limited time.  But every patient is different and the side effects of treatments can be very different. So, your risk of infection depends on the type of cancer you have and the treatment you get. For example, surgery and radiation therapy do not weaken a person’s resistance to infection nearly as much as a bone marrow transplant that uses high doses of chemotherapy (chemo). And some drugs used to treat cancer are less likely than others to affect a person’s ability to resist infection. \n \n  Infections that develop in people who have cancer or who are getting cancer treatment can be more serious than those in people who are otherwise healthy. They can also be harder to treat. If you have cancer, it’s important to find and treat infections early, before they get worse and spread. Talk to your cancer care team about your risk for infection.\n \n  Parts of the body most likely to get infection\n \n  Common sites of infection in people with cancer include\n    :\n \n   \n   The skin and mucous membranes (soft linings, like inside the mouth, vagina, and intestines)\n \n   The digestive system (mouth, esophagus, stomach, and intestines)\n \n   The lungs and breathing passages (sinuses and throat)\n \n   The urinary system (bladder and kidneys)\n \n   The nervous system (brain and spinal cord)\n \n   The skin and tissue around a central venous catheter (CVC). A CVC is a tube or catheter put in a vein and used to draw blood and give IV drugs or fluids\n \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n \n  Risk factors for infection\n \n   \n   .\n      Some types of cancer treatment, such as chemotherapy, radiation therapy, stem cell transplant, or bone marrow transplant can cause neutropenia (a decrease in the number of neutrophils, a component of white blood cells, in your blood). This means your immune system is weaker and your body may not be able to fight infections as well as it should.\n \n    such as steroids can make your immune system weaker and increase your risk of infection.\n \n   , such as those that affect the bone marrow or those that can spread to the bone, may increase the risk of an infection. Ask your doctor if your cancer puts you at an increased risk for infection.\n \n   . Irritation or soreness of the digestive tract lining. Patients with mucositis will often have mouth sores.\n \n    such as diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), autoimmune disease, among others. If you have other medical conditions, ask your doctor if they put you at increased risk for infection.\n \n   , such as poor nutrition, stress, or lack of sleep.\n \n  \n \n  Know your risk of infection\n \n  It’s important to weigh the risk of infection and other side effects against the benefits of cancer treatment. Each patient's situation is different because people with cancer might have other health problems that can affect how they respond to cancer treatment. Talk with your doctor before and during cancer treatment about your risk for infection. Here are some questions you can ask your doctor or cancer care team about infection: \n \n   \n   Does my type of cancer or cancer treatment make me more likely to get infections? If so, when am I at increased risk?\n \n   What kinds of infections are most common for someone in my situation?\n \n   What signs or symptoms should I watch for and when should I call you?\n \n   What symptoms would need urgent care at the emergency room? If I have to go to the emergency room, is there anything special I need to tell the people who work there?\n \n   Will you do anything to help keep me from getting infections during treatment?\n \n   What can I do to lower my risk of infection?\n \n   If I get a fever, does that mean I have an infection?\n \n   How will you decide how to treat my infection?\n \n  \n \n  Signs of infection in people with cancer\n \n  It’s important to watch for early signs of infection and tell your health care team about them right away. This way treatment can be started as early as possible to prevent the infection from spreading to other parts of the body. This is even more important for people who have a low white blood cell count (neutropenia). \n \n  Signs and symptoms of an infection might include:\n \n   \n   Fever (higher than normal body temperature). Your cancer care team will tell you what temperature they consider a fever.\n \n   Shaking chills or sweats (often goes along with fever)\n \n   Sore throat\n \n   Sores or white coating on your tongue or in your mouth\n \n   Cough or shortness of breath\n \n   Nasal congestion\n \n   Burning or pain when urinating; bloody or cloudy urine\n \n   Redness, swelling, drainage, or warmth at the site of an injury, surgical wound, or IV such as a central venous catheter (VAD), or anywhere on the skin including the genital and rectal areas\n \n     \n        \n \n   Pain or tenderness in the stomach or abdomen (the belly)\n \n   Stiff neck\n \n   Sinus pain, ear pain, or headache\n \n  \n  \n   Sometimes, fever is the only sign of an infection. Patients with neutropenia\n     may not have other signs or symptoms of an infection, except for fever.You should have a thermometer to check your temperature – you can’t rely on how you feel to know when you have a fever. Patients may be told to call their doctor or nurse if they have a fever, or if they have other signs and symptoms of infection.  \nAsk your doctor what you should do and when you should call. Be sure you know how to reach your health care team after hours, including nights and weekends.\n \n  Key things you need to know\n \n  It’s important for people with cancer and their families and friends to know these things:\n \n   \n   Your risk for infection\n \n   How long your immune system is likely be weak after treatment\n \n   How to take your temperature the right way, when to check it, and how often to check it\n \n   When to report a fever or other signs and symptoms of infection to the doctor or nurse\n \n   The importance of hand washing and hygiene for the patient and the people they come in contact with\n \n   How to take good care of your mouth and check for sores and signs of infection\n \n   How to clean cuts, scrapes, or other breaks in the skin and keep them clean to help prevent infection\n \n   The importance of cleaning around the anus after each bowel movement, using moist towelettes or baby wipes\n \n   Good care of IVs and central venous catheters (CVCs, like ports and PICC lines)\n \n   Where to look for signs of infection (skin, mouth, and CVC sites)\n \n   The importance of good nutrition, a balanced diet, and drinking plenty of fluids\n \n   The importance of sleep and exercise\n \n   The need to take medicines as prescribed\n \n   That the doctor knows about all medicines you’re taking (prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, herbs, and supplements) – keep a list and update it at each doctor visit\n \n   Ways to prevent dryness of the skin and mucous membranes\n \n   The importance of talking with your health care team or doctor before getting vaccinated (immunized) and before getting close to children or adults who have recently had vaccinations. \n \n  \n \n  Review these points with your cancer care team before and during treatment to get the information you need. Double check with them on how you should handle these things and find out if there are any special steps you should take during cancer treatment.\n"

        "text": "Why People with Cancer Are More Likely to Get Infections \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n \n \n  \nPeople with cancer may have a higher risk of infection because of changes in the immune system that control their body’s defense systems. Cancer and cancer treatments can affect the immune system and other body systems in different ways. People with cancer might be more likely to get infections because of:\n \n   \n   The cancer itself\n \n   Certain types of cancer treatment\n \n   Poor nutrition\n \n   Other health problems or medications that aren't related to cancer\n \n  \n \n  Your cancer care team will talk to you about any increased risk for infection you may have, and what can be done to help prevent infection. If the risk is due to cancer treatment, it is usually temporary because the immune system recovers after a period of time, but this depends on your situation. You can learn more in Watching for and Preventing Infections in People With Cancer. \n \n  \n \n  How your body protects itself from infection\n \n   \n  \n \n  Your body has many ways to protect itself from infections. It helps to understand how  your body normally does this, and how cancer and cancer treatment can change this process. This may help you better understand why infections can develop so quickly and be so serious in people with cancer.\n \n  Skin and mucous membranes\n \n  The skin is your body’s largest organ and an important barrier against infections. It’s your first line of defense in protecting internal tissues from harmful germs. When there’s a break in your skin, it’s easier for germs to get into your body and cause infection. \n \n  Mucous membranes, which form the moist, pink lining layer of the mouth, throat, nose, eyelids, urethra, vagina, and digestive system, also act as  partial barriers against infection. These membranes normally help protect us from germs in the air we breathe, our environment, and in our food and drink. Cancer treatments (such as chemotherapy, targeted therapy, immunotherapy, radiation therapy, or surgery) and certain procedures (like putting in catheters or IVs, or getting shots) can injure cells in the skin or cause damage to the skin or mucous membranes. This makes it easier for germs to enter the body.\n \n  The immune system \n \n  If germs get through the skin or mucous membranes, the job of protecting the body shifts to your immune system. Your immune system is a group  of cells, tissues, and organs that work together to help find and attack germs that invade the body and cause infections.\n \n  White blood cells, a part of the immune system, are the main type of cell responsible for protecting the body against infections. There are different types of white blood cells, and they each have a role in defending the body against infections. Normally, most of our white blood cells are neutrophils. Neutrophils are key infection-fighters and form an important defense against most types of infections. The other types of white blood cells (lymphocyte, monocytes, and macrophages) also help fight infections.\n    \n  Cancer itself can increase infection risk\n \n  Some types of cancer can change the way the immune system blood cells work. For instance, lymphomas (Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin), multiple myeloma, and most types of leukemia start in immune system blood cells. Other types of cancer can also affect the immune system and its cells. They can change the immune system cells so that cells that once protected your body begin to interfere with the normal way your immune system works. Cancer cells can get into the bone marrow cells where blood cells are made. The cancer cells then compete with the normal bone marrow cells for space and nutrients. If too many normal bone marrow cells are destroyed or pushed out of the bone marrow, the few cells that are left won't be able to make enough white blood cells (WBCs) to help the body fight infection.\n \n  Cancer can also damage other parts of the immune system. A tumor that grows on the skin or in mucous membranes can break natural barriers and allow germs to get in. Tumors that are large might reduce blood flow to normal tissues by pressing on them or their blood supply. Tumors in the lungs may block normal mucus drainage, which can lead to infections. And, other types of tissues that have been damaged by cancer can be more prone to infections. \n \n  Cancer treatments can increase infection risk\n  \n  Certain cancer treatments can interfere with the way the immune system works. The damage can be short- or long-term. For example, if a person with cancer has their spleen removed due to cancer, this causes long-term damage because the spleen is part of the immune system. On the other hand, radiation therapy, immunotherapy, and chemotherapy, either alone or in combination can lead to short-term (temporary) immune system damage because they affect immune system blood cells for a fairly short period of time. A bone marrow or stem cell transplant uses very high-dose treatments to kill cancer cells that also damage immune system cells for weeks to months.\n      \n     \n  \n \n    \n   Surgery\n \n   Any type of major surgery can weaken the immune system. Anesthesia (the drugs used to make the patient sleep) may play a role. It might take from 10 days to many months for the immune system to recover completely. Surgery also breaks the skin and can damage mucous membranes and tissue under the skin, causing it to be exposed to germs. The wound caused by surgery (the incision) is a common place for infection. Because surgery is often used to diagnose, stage, or treat people with cancer, it’s important to know that surgery can increase the risk of certain infections. Things that raise the risk of infection after surgery include:\n \n    \n    How long the person is in the hospital\n \n    The extent of the surgery (how much cutting was done)\n \n    How long the operation took\n \n    The amount of bleeding during surgery\n \n    The person’s nutritional status\n \n    Prior cancer treatment, such as chemotherapy or radiation or medical problems such as diabetes, or heart or lung problems\n \n   \n \n   People with cancer may get antibiotics before and for a short time after having surgery to help protect them from infection.\n \n   Chemotherapy\n \n   Chemotherapy (often called chemo) is the most common cause of a weakened immune system in people getting cancer treatment. Chemotherapy can cause \n     neutropenia (a decrease in the number of neutrophils, a type of white blood cell, in your blood). This means your body may not be able to fight infections as well as it should. The effects on the immune system depend on many things, including:\n \n    \n    Which chemo drugs are used\n \n    Chemo dose (how much of each drug is given at once\n \n    How often chemo is given\n \n    Past cancer treatments\n \n    The person’s age (older people are more likely to get infections, with or without cancer)\n \n    The person’s nutritional status\n \n    The type of cancer\n \n    How much cancer there is (the stage of the cancer)\n \n   \n \n   Some drugs affect the bone marrow and immune system more than others. After treatment ends, your blood cell counts usually go back to normal over time.\n \n   Radiation therapy\n \n   Radiation therapy\n     can also cause low white blood cell counts, which increases the risk for infections.\n \n   Factors in how radiation therapy affects the immune system, include:\n \n    \n    The total radiation dose\n \n    The radiation schedule\n \n    The part of the body being treated with radiation\n \n    How much of the body is treated with radiation\n \n    Whether or not you are receiving chemotherapy in addition to radiation therapy.\n \n   \n \n   or TBI (where a person’s entire body is treated with radiation) is the only type of radiation likely to cause very low white blood cell counts. This type of radiation may be used during a bone marrow or stem cell transplant.  Radiation is most often given to just one part of the body, so the whole immune system isn’t damaged by it. Still, depending on the dose and the part of the body being treated with radiation, the skin or mucous membranes may be damaged, so you’re less able to keep germs out. Today, radiation treatments are most often given over many sessions rather than in one large dose. This helps decrease the amount of skin and tissue damage, immune suppression, and the risk of infections.\n \n   Targeted therapy\n \n   Some types of targeted therapy can affect how the immune system works. They target a certain part of a cancer cell or a certain protein or enzyme that is on the surface of a cancer cell. Finding these targets helps the immune system see the cancer cells easier so it can attack them. \n \n   Immunotherapy\n \n   Immunotherapy is used in certain types of cancer to help the immune system recognize and attack cancer cells. This can be done by giving treatments that help your own immune system work harder or smarter, or by giving you man-made immune system proteins or altered cells that are trained to find and attack cancer cells. Immunotherapy is sometimes used by itself to treat cancer, or used along with or after another type of treatment. These treatments help the body have better immune reactions against cancer cells, but sometimes they change the way the immune system works. Because of this, people who get immunotherapy may be at risk for having a weaker immune system and getting infections.\n  \n   Stem cell transplant (bone marrow transplant)\n \n   Stem cell transplant (SCT) is the term used to include bone marrow transplant \n(BMT), peripheral blood stem cell transplant (PBSCT), and umbilical cord blood stem cell transplant \n(UCBSCT). Stem cell transplants are used to replace bone marrow cells that have been destroyed by cancer or by the chemo and/or radiation used to treat the cancer. These transplants allow doctors to use very high doses of chemo and/or total body irradiation (TBI) to try to kill all the cancer cells in the body.\n \n   In the process of killing the cancer cells, the blood-forming stem cells of the patient’s normal bone marrow are also killed. Because of this, stem cells (either from the blood or bone marrow) are removed from the patient and saved before the high-dose chemo is given. Or, stem cells may be taken from a donor or banked umbilical cord blood. Once the cancer cells are killed, the saved or donated stem cells are given to the patient so that blood cells can be made and the immune system rebuilt. High-dose chemo used with TBI causes more severe immune weakness that lasts for a longer time. It can also damage the skin and mucous membranes and make them less able to keep germs out of the body. This increases the risk of infection.\n  \n  \n \n    \n   Poor nutrition and infection risk\n \n   All cells need nutrients to grow and work. Lack of vitamins, minerals, calories, and protein can weaken your immune system and make it less able to find and destroy germs. This means people who are poorly nourished (malnourished) are more likely to develop infections. People who are malnourished either do not take in enough calories and nutrients, or the body can’t use the food it takes in. Either way, it can weaken your immune system.\n \n   People with cancer often need extra calories and protein to support their immune system cells and other tissues. For example, recovery from surgery increases the body’s need for nutrients.\n \n   People with cancer might be poorly nourished for many reasons:\n \n    \n    The cancer itself can make it hard to eat or digest food. This is common in people with cancers of the digestive system, mouth, or throat.\n \n    Cancer treatments, like radiation therapy and chemotherapy, can cause nausea and a loss of appetite.\n \n    Cancer cells use up nutrients, leaving less to meet the needs of normal, healthy tissues.\n \n   \n \n   People with cancer often need help from dietitians or doctors to get enough calories and nutrients. Dietary supplements, tube feedings, or even intravenous (IV, through a vein) feedings may be needed to help in some cases.\n \n   It's important to know that avoiding or eating certain kinds of foods will not affect white blood cell counts (one reason your immune function may not be normal). However, your doctor might have you meet with a dietitian to plan what you should eat and to get help managing eating problems. Nutrition counseling should include the importance of getting enough calories, protein, and vitamins. This is tailored to each person’s food intake and nutrition problems.\n \n   Learn more about what to eat during cancer treatment in Nutrition for the Person With Cancer.\n \n  \n  \n  Low white blood cell counts and infection risk\n \n  Certain cancer treatments (such as chemotherapy, radiation therapy, surgery, stem cell or bone marrow transplant, or steroids) or the cancer itself can suppress or weaken the immune system. These treatments can lower the number of white blood cells (WBCs) and other immune system cells. Treatment can also cause these cells to not work as well as they should. This is called immunosuppression. It’s much easier to get an infection when there aren’t enough WBCs to destroy germs, especially the type of WBCs called neutrophils.\n \n  Neutrophils are a very important defense against most types of infection. When looking at your risk of getting an infection, doctors look at the number of neutrophils you have. A low neutrophil count is called neutropenia\n    .\n The doctor may say you are neutropenic.\n"

        "text": "Managing and Treating Infections\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n \n  \n  \nPeople with cancer can be at risk for different types of infections. These infections differ in their risk factors, the symptoms they cause, how they are treated, and the chance of curing the infection. If you have an infection, your doctor will need to assess you to find out:\n  \n   \n   The part of your body affected\n \n   The type of germ causing the infection\n \n  \n  \n  Your signs and symptoms (for instance, where you have pain, redness, and/or swelling) help your doctor know what tests are needed to find the cause of the infection. The results of certain tests (such as x-rays, CT scans, or lab tests done on body fluids) help pinpoint where the infection is and the type of germ causing it.\n \n  Common sites of infection in people with cancer include:\n \n   \n   The skin and mucous membranes (soft linings, like inside the mouth, vagina, and intestines)\n \n   The digestive system (mouth, esophagus [swallowing tube], stomach, and intestines)\n \n   The lungs and breathing passages (sinuses and throat)\n \n   The urinary system (bladder and kidneys)\n \n   The nervous system (brain and spinal cord)\n \n   The skin and tissue around a central venous catheter (CVC). A CVC is a tube or catheter put in a vein that is used to draw blood and give IV drugs or fluids.\n \n  \n \n  Identifying the cause of the infection\n \n  Germs can be bacteria, viruses, fungi, parasites and other organisms. Many kinds of germs normally live on the skin, in the intestines, or in the environment. These germs usually do not cause problems in people with normal defenses and healthy immune systems. But if the normal defense barriers and immune system are weak, the germs can get in the body, grow, and cause damage.\n \n  These infections are often called , because the germs use the opportunity of a patient’s weakened defenses to cause illness.\n \n  Knowing the exact type of germ that’s causing an infection helps doctors choose the best treatment. Different drugs are used to treat each of the main types of germs – bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites. And even among the main types of germs, different types are treated with different drugs. This means an antibiotic that can kill one type of germ might have no effect on another type of germ. And some germs become resistant to certain antibiotics so sometimes more than one type of treatment is needed to kill the germ that's causing an infection.\n      \n  Lab tests identify what germs may be causing your infection. Some lab tests can also tell your doctor what medication your infection will best respond to. If you have symptoms that point to a certain area of infection, samples will be taken to check for germs in that area. For example, sputum samples may be taken if you have a cough or are short of breath.\n \n  Urine samples may be taken if you have blood in your urine or feel pain while passing urine. Sometimes, if a person has a very low white blood cell count and a fever, blood and urine samples will be taken before other symptoms start. Your health care team will let you know what lab tests you may need and what samples will need to be collected.\n \n  Your doctor may use different tests for different kinds of germs. You may hear your cancer care team mention a gram stain test, viral antigen tests to test for viruses, or genetic tests that test for certain germs by testing their genetic make-up. A common test used in patients who have very low white blood cell count (neutropenia) and fever is aculture and sensitivity test. The culture is done first, followed by the sensitivity test. For the culture, samples from the suspected site of infection are collected and put in the lab to grow. Sometimes, bacteria, and fungi may take at least a few days before they can be seen. Viruses may take a few weeks to grow. Once enough germs have grown, they are tested and identified. After bacteria or fungi has been cultured, a sensitivity test may be done on the cultured sample. This will help show the best medication to kill the germ causing a certain infection\n \n  Drugs used for treating infections in people with cancer\n  \n  Because infections in people with cancer can quickly get worse, sometimes treatment is started before the lab results come back. Often broad-spectrum antibiotics are started right away. A broad-spectrum antibiotic will treat different bacteria at the same time. Treatment may be changed after the lab tests have identified the exact germ and which drug will work best to treat it. Doctors know which germs tend to infect certain body parts of people with cancer. So they can often make an educated guess at which germs are most likely causing a patient’s infection. Educated guesses are very important because it can take many days to get the results of tests that show the exact type of germ causing an infection and which drug will best stop or kill it.\n  \n  Infections in cancer patients are often treated according to the germ that is causing them. Anti-infectives are drugs used to prevent or treat infections, for example: \n \n   \n    Antibiotics(sometimes more than one at the same time) are used to treat bacterial infections \n \n   Anti-fungal drugs are used to treat fungal infections \n \n   Anti-viral drugs are used to treat viral infections \n \n   Anti-protozoal drugs to treat protozoal infections \n \n  \n \n  Anti-infectives are often given to patients when an infection is suspected or after an infection has been identified to treat the infection. Other times, they may be given to patients who have known risk for a particular germ before they get an infection to prevent the infection. \n \n  For patients with a suspected infection; after a physical exam, lab tests, cultures, and sometimes even imaging studies or special procedures will be done. This will help the doctor find out exactly where the infection is and help figure out which germ may be causing it. Then anti-infectives (which can be antibiotics, anti-viral, anti-fungal, or anti-protozoal drugs) are started quickly. After the exact germ is identified, the same anti-infective may be continued, or new ones may be started if the tests show others would work better or if another type of germ is identified.\n \n  Only bacterial infections are described below. If you have a different kind of infection, talk to your doctor for more information about it and its treatment. \n \n  Bacterial infections\n   \n \n  When treating bacterial infections in people with weak immune systems, an antibiotic that will treat many different bacteria are often chosen first, especially if doctors aren’t yet sure what’s causing the infection. These are called . Often, more than one antibiotic is used at the same time.\n \n   Even in serious situations, overuse of antibiotics must be avoided because this can make some bacteria resistant to these drugs. Such germs are called drug resistantbecause they no longer respond to the antibiotics that killed them in the past. Germs change and adapt all the time. For example, some strains of Staphylococcus\n (staph) have become resistant to certain antibiotics. These strains get special names. Staph that’s resistant to methicillin is called , or . \nThis is often shortened to the initials . There are newer drugs that can still work against some of these hard-to-kill germs. To avoid spreading drug-resistant bacteria to other patients, health care workers often wear disposable gowns and gloves when caring for people known to have these infections.\n  \n  \n \n   \n  \n          \n  Treating  infections in cancer patients \n \n  Fever, swelling, pain, and other signs of infection in a person known to have a weak immune system are treated as medical emergencies. In the past, people with cancer were almost always put in the hospital to treat infections, and some still are. But many patients can take their antibiotics at home as pills or liquids. Those who need intravenous (IV) antibiotics may be able to get them in infusion clinics, doctor’s offices, or even at home. If this happens, talk to your cancer care team to learn where you can receive treatment.\n  \n  For the first few days, patients should be assessed daily to see if the infection is getting better and to see if they are having any side effects. The doctor might also want you to have lab tests often during treatment. If the patient still has a fever during treatment, they should be assessed daily by their cancer care team. Anti-infectives may be changed or new ones may be started when the final culture or other test results come in. The culture results should tell the doctor which germ is causing the infection.\n \n  If the patient doesn’t get better, an infectious disease specialist may be called in. These are doctors who specialize in treating infections. This doctor may recommend extra testing and different treatments.\n \n  In some cases, injections of drugs called CSFs (colony-stimulating factors) may be given to stimulate the bone marrow to produce more white blood cells (WBC) so the body can better fight the infection. Examples of CSFs include filgrastim (Neupogen), tbo-filgrastim (Granix), and pegfilgrastim (Neulasta).\n \n  Each type of infection is treated with different drugs and for different lengths of time. If you have any questions about the drugs you are given or why you’re taking them, talk with your doctor or nurse.\n"

        "text": "Watching for and Preventing Infections\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n \n \n  \nCancer and cancer treatments can weaken the immune system. The immune system is a complex system the body uses to resists infection by germs, such as bacteria or viruses.\n \n  When the immune system is weakened, there is a higher risk for infection. Because of this, infection is a common complication of cancer and cancer treatment and certain types can be life-threatening if not found and treated early.\n \n  If you're getting treatment for cancer, your cancer care team will talk to you about any increased risk for infection you may have, and what can be done to help prevent infection. Usually the risk is temporary because the immune system recovers after a period of time, but each person is different.\n \n  For cancer patients who finished treatment a few years ago or longer, their immune systems have most likely recovered. But this depends a lot on the type of cancer you had, the type of treatment you received, and other medical problems you might have that can affect your immune system.\n \n  \n \n  \n \n  Preventing infections in people with cancer\n \n  Here are some things you can do that might help prevent infection and illness when your immune system is weak due to cancer and/or cancer treatment:\n \n   \n   Wash your hands often with soap and warm water. Be sure to wash your hands before eating and before touching your face or mucous membranes (eyes, nose, mouth, etc.).\n \n   Wash your hands after using the bathroom, blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing.\n \n   Wash your hands after touching animals, collecting trash, or taking out garbage.\n \n   Wash your hands after visiting a public place or touching items used by others.\n \n   Carry an alcohol-based hand sanitizer to clean your hands when you’re out.\n \n   Use moist cleaning wipes to clean surfaces and things that you touch, such as door handles, ATM or credit card keypads, and any items that are used by other people.\n \n   Avoid large crowds of people such as at schools, travel, shopping, social events, and public gatherings. If you have to be around a crowd, it's a good idea to wear a mask.\n \n   Stay away from anyone with a fever, the flu, or other infection.\n \n   Get your flu shot every fall. Encourage other members of your household to get it, too.  get the nasal mist flu vaccine. Ask your doctor if you should get any other vaccinations\n    , such as the pneumococcal vaccine to prevent pneumonia, or Hepatitis B vaccine to prevent Hepatitis B.\n \n   If your cancer care team has told you that you have a weakened immune system and that you are at high risk for infection, you might be advised to stay away from children and limit visitors during the respiratory virus season.\n \n   Bathe every day. Be sure to wash your feet, groin, armpits, and other moist, sweaty areas.\n \n   After bathing, look for redness, swelling, and/or soreness where any tubes or catheters go into your body.\n \n   Wear gloves when you garden and wash up afterward.\n \n   Brush your teeth twice each day using a soft toothbrush. Ask your doctor or nurse if it’s OK to gently floss your teeth or use a water flosser. Tell them if your gums bleed. Your doctor or nurse may give you a special mouthwash to help clean your mouth. Do not use alcohol-based mouthwashes.\n \n   Keep your groin and anal areas clean. Use soft moist tissues such as disposable baby wipes or bathroom towelettes after using the toilet and anytime you notice irritation or itching. Tell your doctor about any bleeding, redness, or swelling (lumps) in this area.\n \n   Do not get manicures or pedicures at salons or spas (you can use your own personal and well-cleaned tools at home). Do not use false nails or nail tips.\n \n   Do not wade, play, or swim in ponds, lakes, rivers, or water parks.\n \n   Do not get into hot tubs.\n \n   Wear shoes all the time – in the hospital, outdoors, and at home. This helps you avoid injury and keep germs off your feet.\n \n   Use an electric shaver instead of a razor to avoid cuts and nicks. Do not share shavers.\n \n   If you cut or scrape your skin, clean the area right away with soap and warm water. Cover the area with a clean bandage to protect it. If the bandage gets wet or dirty, clean the area and put on a new bandage. Tell your doctor if you notice redness, swelling, pain, or tenderness.\n \n   Prevent constipation and straining to move your bowels by drinking the recommended amount of fluid each day.. Exercising each day can help, too. Ask your doctor how much fluid you should drink daily and if it is safe for you to exercise. Let your doctor or nurse know if you are having bowel problems. If needed, your doctor may give you a bowel softener medicine. Do not put anything in your rectum, including enemas, thermometers, and suppositories.\n \n   Women should not use tampons, vaginal suppositories, or douche.\n \n   Use water-based lubricants during sex to avoid injury or abrasion of the skin and mucous membranes. Use latex or plastic condoms to reduce the risk of sexually transmitted infections.\n \n   Do not keep fresh flowers or live plants in your bedroom.\n \n   Do not clean up droppings from your pets. Do not clean bird cages, litter boxes, or fish or turtle tanks. Have someone else do this for you.\n \n   Do not touch soil that may contain feces of animals or people.\n \n   Do not change diapers, but if you do, wash your hands very well afterward.\n \n   If you use disposable gloves to avoid touching things like soil or waste, wash your hands after you take off the gloves. (Gloves can have tiny holes that you can’t see.)\n \n   Stay away from all standing water, for example, in vases, denture cups, and soap dishes. If you store your dentures in a cup, wash the cup and change the water with each use.\n \n   Use hot water or a dishwasher to clean your dishes.\n \n   Do not share bath towels or drinking glasses with anyone, including family members.\n \n   Stay away from chicken coops, caves, and any place where dust from the ground is being blown into the air, such as construction sites.\n \n   Talk with your doctor or nurse if you are planning any travel during this time.\n \n  \n \n  Be aware of and watch for signs and symptoms of infection. Talk to your doctor about what you should watch for and what you need to report right away.\n \n  Food safety tips for the person with cancer\n \n  Infections can be picked up from food and drinks. So, food safety is very important when your immune system is weaker than normal. Talk to your cancer care team about whether you need to follow a special diet during your cancer treatment. Wash your hands before handling any food products. Make sure all meat products (this may include chicken, beef, and other meat products) are cooked thoroughly to kill any bacteria that may be present.\n \n  Fresh fruits and vegetables can have germs on the outside which can cause illness. Some doctors tell their patients who have weak immune systems not to eat any fresh fruits or vegetables to help lower the risk of infection. Others allow their patients to eat fresh fruits and vegetables as long as they are washed thoroughly first. It’s important to know that even when the outer part of a fruit (such as the peel or rind) isn’t eaten, it still needs to be washed before it’s peeled. If it isn’t, germs can get on the part that is eaten when the peel or rind is cut. It may also be a good idea to avoid certain foods that have been linked to outbreaks before, such as raw vegetable sprouts, fresh salsa, and berries. Be careful eating at salad bars, as they have been sometimes associated with certain bacterial infections.\n \n  Talk with your doctor about any dietary questions or concerns you may have, or ask to talk with a registered dietitian. For more detailed information about safely handling foods, see Food Safety During Cancer Treatment\n \n  Drugs given to prevent infections during cancer treatment\n \n  Sometimes, doctors prescribe medicines when a person’s immune system is very weak – even though there’s no sign of infection. The drugs are given to help keep you from getting an infection.\n \n  Preventive drugs\n \n  Anti-bacterial, anti-viral, and/or anti-fungal drugs may be used to help prevent infection. You may hear this called  use, or just . Prophylaxis is only used when there’s a very high risk of getting infections (the immune system is very weak). You might also be given antibiotics if you are taking other medicines that can weaken your immune system, such as a long course of steroids or certain chemotherapy drugs.\n \n  The preventive drugs are stopped when your immune system is no longer so weak (often some time after the immune-weakening drugs are stopped). Using antibiotics in this way does not prevent all infections. That means it’s still important to use the same precautions as when you aren’t taking preventive drugs, and be sure to tell your doctor about any new signs of infection.\n \n  Growth factor drugs\n \n  Growth factors are proteins your body makes to help your blood cells grow. They are also known as  (\nCSFs)\n or Growth factors stimulate the bone marrow to produce more white blood cells to help the body fight infection. You can be given injections of man-made CSFs. They are most often used after chemo to help prevent infection. Your doctor also may give you a CSF if your immune system is weak and you have a serious infection that’s getting worse even though you’re getting treatment.\n \n  Common CSF drugs used today include filgrastim (Neupogen), pegfilgrastim (Neulasta), and tbo-filgrastim (Granixe).\n \n  Growth factors can have side effects in some people, but they can reduce the risk of infection in the patients who need them. Talk to your cancer care team about the risks and benefits of CSFs. Talk to your cancer care team about what side effects you might experience while using CSFs and what you can do to manage the side effects.\n \n  Watching for infection in cancer patients\n \n  Many cancer treatments and cancers can cause changes in your blood counts. A low white blood cell (WBC) count can put you at higher risk of infection. You may hear this called neutropenia, or be told that you are neutropenic.\n \n  The WBC count measures your body’s ability to fight infection. When your WBC count is low, you’ll need to watch for signs of infection so that you can get treatment right away.\n \n  Symptoms of infection to look for\n \n   \n   Fever (a higher than normal body temperature). Your doctor will tell you what temperature to consider a fever. Sometimes, a fever is the only sign of an infection.\n \n   Any new area of redness, tenderness, or swelling\n \n   Pus or yellowish discharge from an injury or other location\n \n   New cough or shortness of breath\n \n   New abdominal (belly) pain\n \n   Shaking chills that may be followed by sweating\n \n   Burning or pain when passing urine\n \n   Sore throat\n \n   Sores or white patches in the mouth\n \n  \n \n  What the patient can do\n \n   \n   Check your temperature by mouth (or under your armpit if you can’t keep a thermometer in your mouth).\n \n   Keep a working thermometer within easy reach and make sure you and your caregivers know how to use it.\n \n   Talk to your cancer care team about what to do if you have a fever. Ask if you should take medications like acetaminophen (Tylenol) for a fever.\n \n   Keep the cancer care team’s contact information with you at all times. Make sure you know when to call, and what number to call during and after regular office hours.\n \n   If you have to go to the emergency room or urgent care, let the team taking care of you know that you are a cancer patient who recently received cancer treatment.\n \n   Take antibiotics or other medicine as prescribed.\n \n   Drink fluids, but don’t force more than you can tolerate.\n \n   Avoid anything that can cause cuts, scrapes, or other breaks in the skin.​\n \n   Wash your hands after using the bathroom or visiting public places. Use hand sanitizer when you don’t have soap and water.\n \n   Avoid crowds, and don’t visit with people who have infections, coughs, or fevers. If you have to be around any of these groups of people, it's a good idea to wear a mask.\n \n   If you eat raw foods, wash them carefully and peel them to avoid germs.\n \n   Brush your teeth twice a day. Ask your doctor or nurse if it is safe for you to floss.\n \n  \n \n  What caregivers can do\n \n   \n   Keep a working thermometer within easy reach and make sure the patient and the caregivers know how to use it.\n \n   Watch for shaking chills, and check the patient’s temperature after the shaking stops.\n \n   Check the patient’s temperature using a thermometer in the patient’s mouth or under the armpit. (Do not take a rectal temperature.)\n \n   Encourage visitors who have diarrhea, fever, cough, or the flu to visit the patient only by phone until they are well.\n \n   Offer extra fluids.\n \n   Help the patient take medicines on schedule.\n \n   Keep the cancer care team's contact information with you at all times. Make sure you know when to call, and what number to call during and after regular office hours.\n \n   If you have to take the patient to the emergency room or urgent care, let the team there know that this is a cancer patient who recently received treatment.\n \n  \n \n  Call the health care team if the patient\n \n   \n   Has a fever\n \n   Has shaking chills\n \n   Feels or seems “different”\n \n   Cannot take in fluids\n"

Not all pets pose the same risks, and not all cancer treatments do, either. If you have pets, tell your cancer care team about them and your routines for caring for them. You can find out what might not be safe during cancer treatment. It’s also a good idea to visit your pet’s veterinarian to find out what kinds of illness might be passed from your pet during times when your immune system is weak. \n  \n  It's best to avoid some types of  pets while you're getting cancer treatment (see below). There’s also a big difference between taking in a sick stray and keeping your healthy pet during cancer treatment. Strays often carry more germs and might not be up to date on vaccines.\n \n  Pets that live inside the home and are well-cared for are much less likely to cause problems if precautions are used. Still, pets can sometimes pick up germs that don't make them sick, but if a person with a weak immune system gets some of these germs, they can become ill. \n    \n  How can you get an infection from a pet?\n \n  Bites and scratches\n \n  It’s best if you can avoid bites and scratches while you are getting cancer treatment. If your pet plays rough, you may have to call a halt to that until your immune system recovers.\n \n   \n   Get your dog or cat’s claws trimmed often so that you’re less likely to be scratched.\n \n   Scratches should be cleaned and covered until they heal.\n \n   If any redness, swelling, or pus forms around a scratch, call your doctor right away.\n \n   If your pet bites and breaks the skin, call your doctor. All bites carry the risk of infection and can require hospitalization even in people with normal immune systems. It’s likely you’d need antibiotics and maybe other treatment, depending on the location and severity of the bite. Cat bites are especially likely to become infected, because their long narrow teeth can make deep puncture wounds that are hard to clean.\n \n  \n \n  Feces and urine\n \n  A number of illnesses can be spread via pet droppings, and a few spread through urine.\n \n   \n   Keep litter boxes away from food preparation areas and places where people eat.\n \n   Have someone else remove waste from the litter box or bird cage every day and discard it safely.\n \n   If a pet has an accident inside, it’s best to get someone else to clean it up and the area should be disinfected.\n \n   If you must do the clean-up, wear disposable waterproof gloves and wash your hands afterward.\n \n  \n \n  Licking, saliva, and vomit\n \n  A few illnesses can be transmitted by saliva, so it’s best not to let your pet lick open cuts or near your mouth.\n \n   \n   Wash with soap and water if you get pet saliva on your skin.\n \n   Any vomit should be cleaned up by someone else if possible, while wearing waterproof disposable gloves.\n \n  \n \n  Touch\n \n  Some germs can be picked up by touching or petting the animal. That’s why washing your hands after pet contact is important.\n \n  Protecting your health during cancer treatment \n \n  Here are some tips that can help keep you safe during cancer treatment.\n \n   \n   Avoid very close contact, such as kissing, snuggling, or sleeping with your pet in the same bed.\n \n   Visit your veterinarian so your pet(s) can be checked for any diseases that might cause infection and get medications to prevent infections from heartworms, fleas, or ticks.\n \n   Make sure your pet(s) are up to date with their vaccinations. Ask your vet whether any vaccines are “live,” and check with your cancer team before live vaccines are given.\n \n   Have your cat(s) tested for feline leukemia (FeLV) and feline immunodeficiency (FIV) viruses. Even though these viruses can’t infect humans, they affect the cat’s immune system and put them at risk of other infections that can infect humans.\n \n   Bring your pet(s) to a veterinarian if you suspect they are sick.\n \n   Keep your pets and their sleeping areas clean.\n \n   Feed pets only high-quality commercial canned or dry food, or well-cooked table food. Never let them have old or spoiled food, raw meat or its juices.\n \n   Wear waterproof disposable gloves if you must clean the fish tank, bird cage, cat litter box, or to pick up dog droppings.\n \n   Bird cage liners should be cleaned every day.\n \n   Don’t handle the outside of your gloves after you use them. Remove gloves by pulling off from the inside surface at the cuff, then discard them.\n \n   Wash your hands after petting, caring for, touching, feeding, or cleaning up after pets (even if you wore gloves).\n \n   Wash your hands before taking medicines and handling food, dishes, or other things in the kitchen.\n \n   Ask others to clean fish tanks and cages of birds or other pets.\n \n   Avoid contact with animals you don’t know, especially strays or those that look sick.\n \n   Avoid contact with reptiles, their cages or terraria, and objects from their cages.\n \n   Wear gloves when gardening to avoid contact with animal droppings.\n \n   Keep your pets, like cats and dogs indoors as much as possible to minimize exposure to other pets and animals, such as birds and rodents.\n \n   Make sure you have someone who can take care of your pets and their living quarters if you get too sick or have to be in the hospital. Keep written instructions for feeding, cleaning, medicines, toileting, and veterinary contacts ready if needed.\n \n   Getting a new pet during cancer treatment isn’t usually recommended. But if a family chooses to adopt a pet, a healthy older dog or cat would probably pose less risk than those under a year old. The animal should be checked by a veterinarian before it’s brought home. Puppies and kittens can pose higher risks than older pets. They're also more likely to play rough, bite, or have in-home \"accidents\" that must be cleaned up.\n \n   If your pet has a runny nose, cough, weight loss, vomiting, or diarrhea, see a veterinarian right away. He could have an infection that can be passed on to you. A person with a weak immune system might be at higher risk of getting an illness from their pet when it’s sick.\n \n   Keep your pet away from animal waste, garbage, and other \"found treats\".\n \n   Don't let your pet drink from the toilet or standing water outside.\n \n   Don't allow your pet to visit with sick pets or wild or stray animals.\n \n   Watch for signs of rats or mice in your home, and take measures to control them. Don’t allow your pet to hunt them; keep pets away from any infested areas. After rodents are gone, the area should be thoroughly disinfected using a bleach mixture.\n \n  \n \n  Keeping pets healthy\n \n  Be sure that the vet prescribes medicines to prevent heartworms, and use flea and tick prevention for dogs and cats. Pets and their sleeping areas will also need to be kept clean. You might need help with your pets’ care during some parts of your cancer treatment – it’s good to line up a helper or two before you start treatment.\n \n  Help your pet avoid infections\n \n   \n   Keep your dog inside except for brief outings to use the toilet and walks on the leash in places where they won’t meet other animals.\n \n   Cats should also be kept inside – those that go out are likely to hunt birds and small rodents. This is a common way cats get a parasitic infection called toxoplasmosis. It doesn’t often make the cat sick, but it can seriously sicken or even kill someone with weakened immunity.\n \n   Keep your pet from visiting with “outside” pets of unknown health. It’s best not to board your pet in a kennel if you can avoid it.\n \n   Dog parks and pet stores that allow pets inside are other places where pets can pick up new infections.\n \n  \n \n  Pets you shouldn’t be around during cancer treatment\n \n  Reptiles\n \n  People with weak immune systems (especially those getting a stem cell transplant or bone marrow transplant) should not keep reptiles. Snakes, turtles, lizards, and iguanas are very common carriers of salmonella, which can be lethal in people with very weak immune function. This germ can live for some time on surfaces and objects that the animal touched. Because a person doesn’t have to handle the reptile to be exposed to this germ, it can be hard to avoid it.\n \n  Chickens and ducks\n \n  People with very weak immune systems, especially those who are having stem cell transplants, should not have or come in contact with ducklings and chicks. Even as adults, chickens and ducks have a high risk of salmonella or campylobacter infection.\n \n  Rodents and pocket pets\n \n  Hamsters, gerbils, mice, guinea pigs, and ferrets often carry salmonella even when they look healthy. These and other germs can infect humans, causing diarrhea, skin infections, and other illness. If they’re exposed to wild rodents or sick animals, they can share viruses that cause serious illnesses in humans. For these reasons, they may not be good choices for someone getting cancer treatment.\n \n  If you choose to keep pets like these, they should stay inside and away from other animals that may have infections. Habitats should not be kept in children’s rooms. Cages, toys, food and water bowls should be cleaned outside, and kept away from eating and food areas. Use the precautions above when petting, feeding, cleaning cages, or handling their toys. Keep ferret vaccines up to date.\n \n  Other exotic pets\n \n  Animals that normally live in the wild are not recommended for people with weak immune systems. They can carry rare but serious diseases. Monkeys, chinchillas, primates, and other exotic pets may also be more likely to bite.\n \n  Children with cancer and pets\n \n  Children tend to be at higher risk for infection from pets than adults, because they’re more likely to crawl on the floor with the pet and put things in their mouths. Some pets that are fine for adults can pose more of a hazard to children. It’s best to avoid getting a new pet if your child has a weak immune system. This is even more important if the child might be getting a bone marrow or stem cell transplant.\n \n  All of the information about pets and adults with cancer also applies to pets in a household where a child has cancer. When kids are too young to follow the precautions, they shouldn’t interact with pets. Even older children might need your help.\n \n   \n   Adults should supervise the time a child spends with pets.\n \n   Don’t allow kissing, food sharing, or rough play.\n \n   With smaller kids, don’t let them put the pet’s toys or their own fingers in their mouths. Be sure the child’s hands are washed thoroughly afterward, and again before eating, drinking, or taking medicines.\n \n   Be sure your child’s cancer team knows about your pet and ask them if there are any special precautions you need to take.\n \n   Keep your child away from strays, wild animals, petting zoos, and other people’s pets.\n \n  \n \n  If you have questions, be sure to talk with your child's doctor. You can also check with your pet's veterinarian about diseases your child could pick up.\n"

        "text": "Vaccinations and Flu Shots for People with Cancer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n \n \n  \n \n   Should people with cancer get any vaccines?\n \n   It’s generally recommended that vaccines not be given during chemo or radiation treatments – the only exception to this is the flu shot. This is mainly because vaccines need an immune system response to work, and you may not get an adequate response during cancer treatment.\n \n   The immune system is a group of cells, tissues, and organs that work together to resist infection by germs, such as bacteria or viruses. Cancer and cancer treatment can weaken a person’s immune system so that it won’t work as well as it should. It’s important to know which vaccines are safe for people with weak immune systems. Before receiving any vaccines, talk to your doctor about your cancer, cancer treatment, risk factors for the vaccine-preventable disease, whether you need the vaccine, and the best time for you to get it.\n \n   Vaccines, which are also called immunizations or vaccinations, are used to help a person’s immune system recognize and fight certain infections or diseases.\n \n   Live versus inactivated vaccines\n \n    It's important to remember there is a difference between a vaccine with a live virus and one with an inactive virus. It's also important that people with cancer who might have a weak immune system talk to their doctor about whether they can get vaccines. In general, anyone with a weak immune system should  get any vaccines that contain  virus. There are a few vaccines that contain live viruses, which can sometimes cause infections in people with weak immune systems that can become life-threatening. Your doctor can help guide you about which vaccines are safe while your immune system is weak. Be sure to also talk to your doctor before anyone you spend a lot of time with (such as your children or other household members) gets any vaccines.\n \n    If you live with or spend a lot of time with a person who has cancer and might have a weakened immune system, it's important to talk to the doctor if you, your child, or your loved one is due for a vaccination of any kind. Usually, most age-appropriate vaccines can be given, but there are some exceptions.\n \n   COVID-19 vaccines\n \n   Vaccines that can help protect against COVID-19 are now becoming available. To learn more about these vaccines, see COVID-19 Vaccines in People with Cancer.\n \n   Flu shots\n \n   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends everyone 6 months and older get a flu vaccine each year, although there are some rare exceptions. Every year, the CDC gives updates about what's important to know for the upcoming flu season and the vaccine that's available to help prevent the flu. You can read common questions and answers about getting a flu vaccine this season.\n    \n \n   The flu shot is a vaccine that is given to reduce your risk of getting influenza (a viral infection often called \"the flu\"). In patients with cancer and weakened immune systems, it's important to prevent the flu because it can be serious and sometimes life-threatening. It is recommended that cancer patients get the flu shot that has an inactive (dead) flu virus every year. The vaccine is needed every year because research has shown there is usually a different kind of flu virus expected each year, so the vaccines are a little different each year to help be as effective as possible. Your cancer care team will tell you when the best time to receive the flu vaccine is depending on your cancer type and treatment.\n \n   The nasal mist version of the flu vaccine contains a weakened version of the live virus.  . Family members of a person with cancer can safely get the nasal spray (at least in some flu seasons) unless the patient has a severely weak immune system and/or is being cared for in a germ-protected area. For example, household members should not get the nasal mist vaccine if a family member has recently had a stem cell or bone marrow transplant.\n \n   It is recommended that people who live with or care for a person at high risk for flu-related problems get the flu vaccine, too. This means that if you’re being treated for cancer, your family members, caregivers, and children age 6 months and older living at home should get the flu shot. Talk to your doctor for more information or if you have questions about your specific situation.\n \n   MMR (Measles-Mumps-Rubella) vaccine\n \n   This vaccine is used to protect people from 3 viral diseases: measles, mumps, and rubella.\n \n   People who have weak immune systems should not get the MMR vaccine because it contains live virus. But it’s safe for other household members to get it. If needed, your doctor may consider giving you the vaccine before cancer treatment starts. Talk to your doctor for more information or if you have questions about your situation.\n \n    If the person being treated for cancer is exposed to someone with measles, let the doctor know right away. Sometimes, medications can be given to help fight the measles infection before it starts.\n \n   Talk to your doctor about your risk, and if you need to receive the MMR vaccine.\n \n   Pneumococcus (pneumococcal pneumonia) vaccine\n \n   This vaccine can help people with weak immune systems fight off certain lung, blood, or brain infections caused by certain bacteria. Your doctor may recommend one or more doses of the pneumococcal vaccine, depending on your age and health. In cases where patients are having their spleen removed, this vaccine may be give before surgery or sometimes after the surgery. Ask your doctor if you need to receive the pneumococcal vaccine and when you need to get it.\n \n   Meningococcal vaccines\n \n   This vaccine helps prevent meningococcal disease, which can cause meningitis or other infections. This vaccine should not be given during cancer treatment. It may be offered before treatment, or after the patient’s immune system has recovered.  In cases where a patient is having the spleen removed, this vaccine may be given before surgery. Talk to your doctor to see if and when you may need to receive the meningococcal vaccine.\n \n   Polio vaccine\n \n   This vaccine is used to prevent polio, a viral infection linked to severe illness and physical disability. Since the vaccine came out in 1955, polio has become rare in the US.\n \n   Children \nwho have weak immune systems, as well as their siblings and others who live with them, only should get  \npolio virus vaccines. Most doctors in the United States use only the inactivated polio vaccine, but you should ask to be sure. The older oral polio virus vaccine (which is taken by mouth) contains a live virus. People who get the live virus vaccine can pass the virus on to people with weak immune systems.\n \n   Varicella (chickenpox) vaccine\n \n   This vaccine is intended to prevent chickenpox in people who have never had it.\n \n   This is a  virus vaccine. It should not be given to people with weak immune systems, or to people with leukemia, lymphoma, or any cancer of the bone marrow or lymphatic system unless it’s treated and under control. It’s OK for household members of the person with weak immunity to get the varicella vaccine. Talk to your doctor for more information or if you have questions.\n \n    A person with weak immunity who has been around someone with chickenpox should call the doctor right away.\n \n   Shingles (varicella zoster) vaccine\n \n   This vaccine is given to adults age 50 and older who have had chickenpox or shingles in the past to help prevent shingles or make symptoms of shingles less severe.\n \n   If you have a weak immune system from cancer or cancer treatment, talk to your doctor about chicken pox and shingles vaccine options and whether one of these vaccines might be right for you. Also, tell your doctor if you know you have been exposed to chickenpox or shingles.\n"

(To learn more about COVID-19 and how it might affect cancer patients and caregivers, see Common Questions About the COVID-19 Outbreak.)\n \n  Vaccines (also called immunizations or vaccinations) are used to help a person’s immune system recognize and protect the body against certain infections. Vaccines are available to help protect against COVID-19. Here we’ll discuss some of the questions people with cancer (or with a history of cancer) might have about the COVID-19 vaccines.\n \n  \n \n  Is it safe for people with cancer to get any type of vaccine?\n \n  People with cancer (or with a history of cancer) can get some vaccines, but this depends on many factors, such as the type of vaccine, the type of cancer a person has (had), if they are still being treated for cancer, and if their immune system is working properly. Because of this, . To learn more, see Vaccinations and Flu Shots for People with Cancer.\n \n  Which COVID-19 vaccines are available?\n \n  Three COVID-19 vaccines are available in the US.\n \n  Two of the vaccines are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA):\n \n   \n   The  is approved by the FDA for people 16 years of age or older. The initial series is given in 2 doses, 3 to 8 weeks apart.*\n \n   The  is approved by the FDA for people 18 years of age or older. The initial series is given in 2 doses, 4 to 8 weeks apart.*\n \n  \n \n  In addition, some COVID-19 vaccines have received emergency use authorization (EUA) from the FDA for the ages below:\n \n   \n   The  is authorized for people 5 years of age or older. The initial series is given in 2 doses: 3 weeks apart for ages 5 to 11, and 3 to 8 weeks apart for ages 12 and older.*\n \n   The  vaccine is authorized for people 18 years of age and older. It is initially given as a single injection.\n \n  \n \n  *These are the recommended times between the initial 2 doses for the general public. For people with weakened immune systems, which includes many people being treated for cancer, this interval might be different. To learn more, see “What if I have a weakened immune system?”.\n \n   Additional doses of the COVID-19 vaccines have now been authorized. For more on this, see “What if I have a weakened immune system?” and “Should I get a COVID-19 vaccine booster?”\n \n  All three of these vaccines have been found to lower the risk of being infected with COVID-19. They have also been shown to be very effective at lowering the risk of having severe disease, being hospitalized, or dying from COVID-19 if you are infected. But keep in mind that since no vaccine is 100% effective, some people who are fully vaccinated (at least 2 weeks after the last dose of the initial series) might still become infected with COVID-19 and get sick. This is called a .\n \n  How do these vaccines work?\n \n  The Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines contain messenger RNA (mRNA), which is a type of genetic material. After a person receives the vaccine, the mRNA enters cells in the body and tells them to make copies of the COVID-19 virus’s “spike” protein (the protein that normally helps the virus infect human cells). This doesn’t cause disease, but it does help teach the immune system to act against the virus if the body is exposed to it in the future.\n \n  The Johnson & Johnson (Janssen) vaccine contains an adenovirus (a type of virus that is different from the coronavirus that causes COVID-19), which has been changed in the lab so that it contains the gene (piece of DNA) for the COVID-19 virus’s spike protein. Once the adenovirus enters cells in the body, this gene tells the cells to make copies of the spike protein. This triggers the immune system to recognize and attack the COVID-19 virus if the body is exposed to it in the future. The adenovirus in this vaccine is not a live virus because it has been changed so that it can no longer reproduce in the body (nor can it cause disease).\n \n  , as they do not contain the virus that causes COVID-19.\n \n  Some vaccines for other diseases contain changed versions of the live viruses that cause the diseases. These live viruses don’t cause problems in people with normal immune systems. But they might not be safe for people with weakened immune systems, so live virus vaccines typically are not recommended for cancer patients. However, the \n \n  For more on these vaccines, see “Should people with cancer get a specific COVID vaccine?”\n \n  What's the difference between FDA approval and emergency use authorization (EUA)?\n \n  If a vaccine is fully approved by the FDA, it means that the information on the vaccine and its effects have been thoroughly reviewed, and the FDA has determined that the benefits outweigh the known and possible risks for the people it is meant to help.\n \n  In an EUA, the FDA allows the use of a vaccine or drug during a time of emergency, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic, when the available evidence shows the potential benefits outweigh the potential risks. Drugs and vaccines that have been given an EUA continue to be studied in clinical trials. An EUA is not the same as a full FDA approval, which requires a more thorough review of safety and effectiveness.\n \n  Even after a drug or vaccine has been given full approval, the FDA might continue to monitor it for unexpected side effects or for more information that might be helpful to know. For example, it is not yet clear how likely it is that someone who gets one of the vaccines could still spread the virus to others. This is still being studied, as are any possible long-term effects of the vaccines. Researchers are also still trying to determine how long the vaccines will provide protection against the virus.\n \n  What are the side effects of the vaccines?\n \n  Common side effects that have been reported after getting the vaccines include:\n \n   \n   \n \n   \n \n   \n \n   \n \n   \n \n   \n \n   \n \n  \n \n  For the vaccines that require two shots as part of the initial series, the side effects might be a little stronger after the second shot compared to what you might have had after the first injection. In general, the side effects tend to go away within a few days.\n \n  Swollen/tender lymph nodes\n \n  Some people might have swelling or tenderness of the lymph nodes under the arm in which they got the injection. This is often a normal response by the body’s immune system, which is getting ready to fight a future COVID-19 infection.\n \n  A swollen lymph node under the arm might cause concern, since this can also be a sign of breast cancer (as well as some other cancers - see below). The time it takes for the lymph nodes to shrink back down after the vaccine may be a few days to a few weeks, although this is still being studied. If you notice swollen or tender lymph nodes that do not go away after a few weeks (or if they continue to get bigger), contact your doctor to discuss the next steps.\n \n   See “Could the vaccine cause issues if I’m getting a mammogram?” for more information about COVID-19 vaccines and mammograms.\n \n   See “What if I have breast cancer or a history of breast cancer?” for more information about which arm to consider getting the injection in.\n \n   Many types of cancer can spread to nearby lymph nodes (and some types of cancer can start in the lymph nodes). This can cause the nodes to become enlarged. Because the COVID vaccines can also cause lymph nodes to become enlarged, it’s important to talk to your health care team if you are scheduled to get an imaging test (such as an MRI or CT scan) in the weeks after getting a COVID vaccine. In some cases, your doctors might advise that you delay the imaging test if possible, so that any swollen lymph nodes that result from the vaccine aren’t confused for cancer. If you do have a scan done soon after getting the vaccine, it’s important to make sure that your health care team is aware you got the vaccine, so they can take this into account when looking at the scans.\n \n  Serious and long-term side effects of COVID-19 vaccines\n \n  A few uncommon but possibly serious safety concerns have been reported for the vaccines so far.\n \n  \n \n  In very rare cases, people have had serious allergic reactions after getting one of the vaccines. This seems to be more likely in people who have had serious allergic reactions before.\n \n  \n \n  Very rarely, people who have received the Johnson & Johnson (Janssen) vaccine have developed serious blood clots in the brain, lungs, abdomen (belly), legs, or other parts of the body, along with low blood platelet counts. (Platelets are cells that normally help in blood clotting.)\n \n  The FDA and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have reviewed the data on these incidents and have determined that the vaccine’s known and potential benefits outweigh its known and potential risks in people 18 years of age and older.\n \n  People getting the vaccine (and their caregivers) should review the Janssen Fact Sheet for Recipients and Caregivers to learn more about the possible benefits and risks of the vaccine.\n \n  The FDA and CDC recommend that you contact your health care provider right away if you have possible symptoms of a blood clot, such as a severe or constant headache, blurred vision, seizures, abdominal (belly) pain, leg pain or swelling, chest pain, or shortness of breath. You should also contact your health care provider if you have symptoms that might be from a low platelet count, such as new or easy bruising, or tiny purple or red spots on the skin that might look like a rash.\n \n  \n \n  A small proportion of people who have received the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines have developed myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) or pericarditis (inflammation of the lining outside of the heart).\n \n  In most cases, the symptoms started a few days after the second vaccine dose and were more likely to happen in adolescents and young adults. For people who received the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, the risk was highest in boys 12 to 17 years of age and then in men under the age of 40.\n \n  If you receive either the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccine and start to have chest pain, shortness of breath, or feelings of having a fast-beating, fluttering, or pounding heart, the FDA and CDC recommend getting medical attention right away.\n \n  People getting these vaccines (and their caregivers) should review the Moderna Fact Sheet for Recipients and Caregivers and the Pfizer-BioNTech Fact Sheet for Recipients and Caregivers to learn more about the possible benefits and risks of these two vaccines.\n \n  \n \n  GBS has occurred in a very small proportion of people who have received the Johnson & Johnson (Janssen) vaccine. In this syndrome, the body’s immune system damages parts of the nervous system. This can lead to muscle weakness and other symptoms.\n \n  In most people, symptoms began within 6 weeks after getting the vaccine.\n \n  Symptoms of GBS can include:\n \n   \n   Weakness or tingling, especially in the legs or arms, that gets worse and/or spreads to other parts of the body\n \n   Trouble walking\n \n   Trouble with facial movements, including speaking, chewing, or swallowing\n \n   Double vision or having trouble moving the eyes\n \n   Problems with bladder control or bowel function\n \n  \n \n  The FDA advises you to get medical attention right away if you develop any of these symptoms after getting the Janssen vaccine.\n \n  People getting this vaccine (and their caregivers) should review the Janssen Fact Sheet for Recipients and Caregivers to learn more about the possible benefits and risks of the vaccine.\n \n  For the latest information, visit the websites of the FDA and CDC.\n \n  All of these COVID-19 vaccines are still fairly new, so possible long-term side effects are still being studied, and it’s possible that the guidance about the different vaccines might change. If you have concerns about getting the COVID-19 vaccine, it’s important to talk with your doctor.\n \n  Should cancer patients and survivors get the vaccine?\n \n  \n \n  The main concern about getting the vaccine is not whether it’s safe for people with cancer, but about how effective it will be, especially in people with weakened immune systems. Some cancer treatments like chemotherapy (chemo), radiation, stem cell or bone marrow transplant, or immunotherapy can affect the immune system, which might make the vaccine less effective. People with certain types of cancers, like leukemias or lymphomas, can also have weakened immune systems which might make the vaccine less effective.\n \n  Although doctors are still learning about how effective the vaccines are in people being treated for cancer, it’s possible that the vaccines might not be as effective in people with weakened immune systems as compared to people with healthy immune systems. Despite this, experts still recommend that most cancer patients get the vaccine because those with a fragile immune system are at risk for severe COVID-19 disease, so getting even some protection from the vaccine is better than not having any protection. For people with a weakened immune system who are fully vaccinated (at least two weeks past the last dose of their initial series), the CDC also has recommendations on getting an additional dose of COVID-19 vaccine. See “What if I have a weakened immune system?”\n \n  \n \n  For people who are fully vaccinated (at least two weeks past the last dose of their initial series), the CDC has guidance on things you can now do (such as not needing to wear a mask or socially distance in some settings), as well as what types of precautions you should still be taking. This guidance is being updated regularly, so check the CDC website for details. , so it’s important to talk with your health care provider about which precautions you still need to take.\n \n  Should people with cancer get a specific COVID-19 vaccine?\n \n  As mentioned in “Which COVID-19 vaccines are available?”, the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines are mRNA vaccines, while the Johnson & Johnson (Janssen) vaccine is an adenovirus vaccine. The other main difference between them is that the initial series for the mRNA vaccines is given as two shots over 3 to 8 weeks, while the adenovirus vaccine is initially given as a single shot. (Additional shots are also recommended for some people – see “What if I have a weakened immune system?” and “Should I get a COVID-19 vaccine booster?”)\n \n  All three of the vaccines have been shown to be effective at lowering the risk of getting COVID-19, as well as the risk of severe illness, being hospitalized, or dying from the disease if you are infected.\n \n  At this time, the CDC prefers that people get one of the mRNA (Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna) vaccines over the Johnson & Johnson (Janssen) vaccine. The mRNA vaccines are more readily available and don’t appear to have the rare side effect of blood clots (see “What are the side effects of the vaccines?”). For people who can’t or don’t want to get an mRNA vaccine, the CDC stresses that getting any COVID-19 vaccine, including the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, is better than being unvaccinated.\n \n  As new information about the different COVID-19 vaccines becomes available, it’s possible that the guidance about the different vaccines might change. For this reason,.\n \n  What if I have a weakened immune system?\n \n  Getting the COVID-19 vaccine\n \n  As noted above in “Should cancer patients and survivors get the vaccine?”, the COVID-19 vaccines might not be as effective in people with weakened immune systems. This includes, for example, people who have:\n \n   \n   Been getting active cancer treatment (either for solid tumors or cancers of the blood)\n \n   Received a stem cell transplant or CAR T-cell therapy within the last 2 years or are taking medicine to suppress the immune system\n \n   Been getting active treatment with high-dose corticosteroids or other drugs that may suppress the immune response\n \n  \n \n  Despite this, experts still recommend that those with a weakened immune system get the vaccine because they are at higher risk for severe COVID-19 disease, and because getting even some protection from the vaccine is better than having none.\n \n  As noted in “Which COVID-19 vaccines are available?”, three COVID-19 vaccines are available in the United States at this time. These include:\n \n   \n   The vaccine, which can be used in people 5 years of age or older. For people with weakened immune systems, the initial series is given in 2 doses, 3 weeks apart.\n \n   The  vaccine, which can be used in people 18 years of age or older. For people with weakened immune systems, the initial series is given in 2 doses, 4 weeks apart.\n \n   The  vaccine, which can be used in people 18 years of age and older. It is initially given as a single injection.\n \n  \n \n  At this time, the CDC prefers that people get one of the mRNA (Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna) vaccines over the Johnson & Johnson (Janssen) vaccine.\n \n  Getting an additional dose of the vaccine\n \n  After getting the initial series, getting another dose of vaccine might help people with a weakened immune system to build up a stronger immune response against the virus that causes COVID-19.\n \n  Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines\n \n  The CDC recommends a  of the mRNA (Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna) vaccines for people 5 years of age and older with moderately to severely weakened immune systems. \n    \n  The third dose of vaccine should be given at least 4 weeks after the second dose. Whenever possible, the same mRNA vaccine should be used for the third dose, according to the CDC. If the same vaccine isn’t available (or if it isn’t known which mRNA vaccine a person got), then either mRNA vaccine may be given for the third dose.\n \n  People who receive this third dose are also eligible for a  (fourth shot) of vaccine, according to the CDC. This should be given at least 3 months after the third dose. (See “Should I get a COVID-19 booster?”)\n \n  Johnson & Johnson (Janssen) vaccine\n \n  For immunocompromised people who initially received the Johnson & Johnson (Janssen) vaccine, the CDC recommends getting an additional dose () using one of the mRNA vaccines, at least 4 weeks after the first dose.\n \n  A  is recommended to be given at least 2 months after the second dose. Any of the three available vaccines can be given for this booster dose, but the mRNA vaccines are preferred. (See “Should I get a COVID-19 booster?”)\n \n  Can other medicines lower risk as well?\n \n  For people with moderately to severely weakened immune systems (see above), the FDA has authorized a combination of the monoclonal antibodies  to help lower the risk of COVID-19 infection. These medicines can be used in people who do not\n have COVID-19 and who have not\n recently been exposed to the virus. It’s important to note that .\n \n  For more information, see “Can other medicines lower the risk of COVID-19 infection?” in Common Questions About the COVID-19 Outbreak.\n \n  \n \n  Should I get a COVID-19 vaccine booster?\n \n  Studies have shown that most people who are fully vaccinated (at least two weeks past the last dose of their initial series) are well protected from severe disease and death from COVID-19, including the variants that are now in the US. However, some research has found that the vaccines might become less effective over time.\n \n  Because of this, the CDC has recommendations about getting a booster dose of vaccine after completing the initial series.\n \n  Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines\n \n   who have received both doses of either vaccine should get a booster shot. This should be at least 5 months after the second dose of the vaccine.\n \n   who have received both doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine should get a booster shot, at least 5 months after the second dose.\n \n  As noted in “What if I have a weakened immune system?”, the CDC recommends that  who initially got one of the mRNA (Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna) vaccines get a third dose of vaccine, at least 4 weeks after the second dose. These people should also get a booster (fourth) shot, which should be at least 3 months after the third dose.\n \n  Johnson & Johnson (Janssen) vaccine\n \n  The CDC recommends that  who received the Johnson & Johnson (Janssen) vaccine get a booster shot at least 2 months after their initial dose.\n \n  As noted in “What if I have a weakened immune system?”, the CDC recommends that  who initially got the Johnson & Johnson (Janssen) vaccine, get a second dose of vaccine, at least 4 weeks after the first dose. These people should also get a booster (third) shot, which should be at least 2 months after the second dose.\n \n  Do I have to get the same vaccine for my booster dose?\n \n  No, not necessarily. For people 18 years of age or older, the CDC allows for mixing and matching of vaccine doses for booster shots. (People aged 12 to 17 who initially got the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine are advised to get the same vaccine for the booster.) For people who received the Johnson & Johnson (Janssen) vaccine as their first dose, the CDC recommends that an mRNA vaccine be the preferred vaccine as the booster shot. \n \n  \n \n  Do I still need to take precautions if I get the COVID-19 vaccine?\n \n  The COVID-19 vaccines are still being studied, as there are things we don’t yet know about them. For example, researchers are still trying to determine how long the COVID-19 vaccines will help protect against the virus. And while the vaccines can clearly lower the risk of getting serious disease from COVID, it’s not yet clear how well they can prevent the spread of the virus to others.\n \n  For people who are fully vaccinated (at least two weeks past the last dose of their initial series), the CDC has guidance on things you can now do (such as not needing to wear a mask or socially distance in certain settings), as well as what types of precautions you should still be taking. This guidance is being updated regularly, so check the CDC website for details. \n \n  What if I have breast cancer or a history of breast cancer?\n \n  Some people who get a COVID-19 vaccine might have swollen lymph nodes under the arm in which the injection was given (see “What are the side effects of the vaccines?” above). Because a swollen lymph node under the arm can also be a sign of breast cancer spread, most doctors recommend that people with breast cancer or a history of breast cancer get the injection in the arm on the opposite side of your breast cancer. For example, if your breast cancer/breast surgery was in the left breast, it is probably best to get the injection in the right arm. If you have had surgery on both breasts, it’s best to talk with your doctor about the best place on your body to get the injection.\n \n  Swollen lymph nodes after a vaccine injection might also have an effect on your mammogram results. (See next question.)\n \n  Could the vaccine cause issues if I’m getting a mammogram?\n \n  Getting a COVID-19 vaccine might result in swollen lymph nodes under the arm in which the injection was given. (See “What are the side effects of the vaccines?” above.)\n \n  Swollen lymph nodes under the arm might show up on a mammogram done to screen for breast cancer, which could cause concern and might lead to the need for further tests.\n \n  If you’re scheduled for a mammogram soon after you get a COVID-19 vaccine, it’s important to tell your doctor when and in which arm you received the injection. Based on your situation, they can discuss with you if you should change your mammogram appointment. \n \n  What if a stem cell transplant or CAR T-cell therapy is (or was) part of my cancer treatment?\n \n  Stem cell transplants and CAR T-cell therapy are types of cancer treatment that can have major effects on the body’s immune system. This can increase your risk of serious infections (including from COVID-19).\n \n  If you’ve  in the past, the CDC still recommends getting the COVID-19 vaccine. This might include an additional dose of vaccine (depending on how long ago you were treated and if you’re now taking drugs to suppress your immune system), as well as a booster dose. (For more on this, see “What if I have a weakened immune system?” and “Should I get a COVID-19 booster?” above.) Many doctors recommend waiting at least 3 months after these cancer treatments before getting the vaccine, to give the body’s immune system a chance to recover.\n \n  If you’ve already gotten the COVID-19 vaccine and , the CDC recommends getting revaccinated\n at least 3 months after treatment. This is because the immune system needs to relearn how to protect the body against COVID-19.\n \n  \n \n  Is it OK for cancer caregivers to get the vaccine?\n \n  Yes. In fact, getting the vaccine can help lower the risk that the person you’re caring for might get COVID-19.\n \n  Some vaccines for other diseases contain changed versions of the live viruses that cause the diseases. These types of live virus vaccines typically are not recommended for cancer caregivers because they might have unwanted effects on cancer patients. However, the available COVID-19 vaccines do not contain these types of live viruses, so getting one of these vaccines does not put you at risk for passing COVID-19 on to the person you’re caring for.\n \n  It’s important to know that if you do get a COVID-19 vaccine and are later exposed to the virus, it’s not yet clear if the vaccine will prevent you from infecting someone else (even if you don’t get sick).\n \n  For people who are fully vaccinated (at least two weeks past the last dose of their initial series), the CDC has guidance on things you can now do (such as not needing to wear a mask or socially distance in some settings), as well as what types of precautions you should still be taking. The CDC also has guidance on who might be eligible for a third dose or booster dose of the vaccines. This guidance is being updated regularly, so check the CDC website for details. \n \n  People getting the vaccine might not feel well for a few days after each shot, so it might make sense to have someone else available to help with caregiving during this time.\n \n  Should I get the flu vaccine as well?\n \n  COVID-19 and influenza (the flu) are caused by different viruses, so getting a vaccine against one of these diseases will NOT protect against the other. Along with talking to their doctor about getting the COVID-19 vaccine, it’s very important for cancer patients talk to their doctor about the benefits and risks of getting the flu shot.\n \n  The flu and COVID-19 are both caused by viruses that can spread easily and can cause serious illness in older people, those with weakened immune systems, and others with certain medical conditions. These infections share many of the same symptoms, so it can be hard to tell which one you might have without having specific tests.\n \n  People who live with or care for someone at high risk of getting the flu should also get the flu vaccine.\n \n  The overlap of this year’s flu season on top of the COVID-19 pandemic could also put a burden on healthcare systems, so getting the flu vaccine could help lessen this.\n \n  The CDC has more information on the differences between COVID-19 and the flu, as well as more information about getting the flu vaccine.\n \n  Where can I get more information about COVID-19 vaccines?\n \n  The CDC and FDA have more information about COVID-19 vaccines, including the different types of vaccines and the known possible risks and benefits of each one.\n \n   \n   \n \n   \n \n  \n \n  For more information about COVID-19 vaccine availability in your area, contact your state or local health department.

        "text": "What are Infusion or Immune Reactions?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n \n \n  \nInfusion reactions can happen when your body has a strong immune response to a cancer treatment that's given intravenously (IV). The types of drugs used in these cancer treatments can be chemotherapy, targeted therapy, or immunotherapy. The process of giving the treatment might be called an IV infusion, injection, or push. \n \n  Most treatments have a low risk for infusion reactions, but for some the risk is higher. And, sometimes the severity of a reaction depends on the dose of the drug and other factors that may be related to the treatment or to other health problems a patient may have. If an infusion reaction happens, it's because your body is reacting very strongly to the treatment which is a foreign substance.\n     Your immune system responds because it's trying to fight off the foreign substance, causing the reaction. \n    \n \n  You may hear your cancer care team call these orhypersensitivity reactions.    Infusion reactions are not true allergic reactions because of how they start in the immune system. But, they can be severe in some people if not recognized and treated quickly. Infusion reactions can happen when the patient is getting that infusion for the first time or at any time during the treatment period, even if the patient has received the infusion once or more times before.\n \n  Infusion reactions can be immediate or delayed. Immediate reactions happen within minutes of beginning to receive your infusion. Delayed reactions can happen up to a few days or weeks after receiving your infusion. Infusion reactions can be mild, moderate, or severe. \n \n  If an infusion is in your treatment plan, talk to your cancer care team about what you'll be getting, your risk of having an infusion reaction, and what to expect if it happens.\n \n  What to watch for during any treatment infusion\n \n   \n   \n \n   Rash or hives\n \n   Swelling of the tongue, lips, or eyelids\n \n   Redness on the face and neck area, also called flushing\n \n   \n \n   Cough\n \n   \n \n   Muscle or joint pain\n \n   Edema (swelling of any part of your body, but more common in hands, legs, ankles, and feet)\n \n   Feeling short of breath\n \n  \n \n  If you have any of these symptoms during your infusion, let your infusion nurse know right away. If you have any of these symptoms at home after your infusion, call your cancer team right away.\n \n  Reactions or side effects specific to immunotherapy\n    \n \n  When receiving immunotherapy, you may have any of the reactions listed above. However, most reactions to immunotherapy\n    don't usually occur during the infusion. Talk to your cancer care team about what to expect and call them or let them know if you have one or more of the following symptoms, as it could mean you are reacting to the immunotherapy drug.\n \n   \n   , which could be mild or severe.\n \n    (inflammation of the colon) that could cause pain, diarrhea, fever, joint pain, and loss of appetite.\n \n    (inflammation of the liver). Let your doctor know if you notice your skin or the whites of your eyes are yellowish, or if you have nausea and vomiting, pain on the right side of the abdomen, feeling drowsy, urine that is dark (tea-colored), loss of appetite, and bruising or bleeding more easily than usual.\n \n    (inflammation of the lung). Let your doctor know if you have fever, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, chest pain or cough.\n \n    . The endocrine system is responsible for making and produce hormones for different jobs in your body. Let your doctor know if you notice one or more of the following, as it could mean your endocrine system is not working as it should: \n     \n     Changes in your eyesight\n \n     Headaches that don’t go away\n \n     Weakness or fatigue that is more than normal\n \n     Increased heart rate (your heart beats faster than normal)\n \n     Muscle or joint aches or pain\n \n     Dizziness or fainting\n \n     Feeling more hungry than usual\n \n     Urinating more than usual\n \n     Changes in mood\n \n     Feeling cold\n \n     Voice getting deeper\n \n     Nausea or vomiting\n \n     Pain in your belly\n \n     Constipation\n \n    \n \n \n   Mouth problems such as  (inflammation of the mouth and lips) and  (inflammation of the digestive lining). Let your doctor know if you notice soreness, blisters, or ulcers in your mouth or lips. If you have mouth sores: Practice good oral hygiene; brush your teeth two or three times daily with a soft toothbrush, and floss; use alcohol-free toothpastes and rinses. Avoid spicy, hard, acidic, and hot foods. Avoid alcohol and tobacco products. Your doctor may be able to prescribe a mouth rinse to help with the pain and irritation.\\\n \n    (inflammation of the joints, such as ankles, knees, or hands). Let your doctor know if you notice swelling in your joints, pain, rash around your joints, or feeling stiff after you’ve been inactive for a while such as in the morning.\n \n   Muscle pain and/or weakness\n \n   Peripheral neuropathy (numbness and tingling in extremities).Let your doctor know if you have numbness or tingling in your hands or feet, numbness, weakness, less ability to feel hot and cold, or cramps in your feet.\n \n    (inflammation of the kidney).

        "text": "Managing Infusion or Immune Reactions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n \n \n  \nNot everyone will have an infusion reaction, but some treatments put you at a higher risk for them, including certain chemotherapy and targeted therapy drugs, and many immunotherapy drugs. There are, however, things that your cancer care team can do to help reduce your risk of having an infusion reaction. \n \n  It's important to remember that an infusion reaction is your body's immune response to a treatment. Because of this, a reaction can happen even when steps were taken to prevent it. \n \n  How the cancer care team helps prevent or manage reactions\n \n  Before the infusion \n \n  Before starting your treatment, your cancer care team will tell you if there is a chance for a reaction and what signs to look for. Your nurse and the rest of the cancer care team will closely monitor you during the infusion. If the infusion drug you are receiving has a known risk for causing reactions, your doctor may prescribe drugs for you to take before your infusion (pre-medications). Pre-medications, sometimes referred to as pre-meds, help reduce the chance that you will react to the infusion drug. Sometimes a pre-medication is taken at home before you come to the treatment center. If you get a pre-medication prescription, take it as instructed. But sometimes the pre-meds are given at the treatment center just before your infusion.\n \n  During the infusion\n \n  Your nurse will monitor you during the infusion. If there are any signs of a reaction, the nurse and doctor will likely stop the infusion to assess you, your vital signs, and your symptoms. \n \n  If you have a reaction \n \n  A treatment infusion is usually stopped, at least for a short time, if there is any sign of a reaction. While the treatment is stopped, plain IV fluids might be given while the cancer care team checks you and decides on the best action. Medications can often help stop a reaction. They might be given right into the IV line or as a pill by mouth. Depending on how severe a reaction is, your doctor may decide to restart the infusion at a slower rate, delay the infusion until a later time, or permanently stop the drug.\n \n  Desensitization\n \n  In certain cases and with certain drugs, your doctor may try to desensitize a patient who has had a reaction in the past.  means the drug is re-introduced to your body slowly until your body can handle the drug without reacting to it.  The drug is given to you in small doses to begin with, and the dose is slowly increased until the dosage goal is reached. This way you still will be able to receive the treatment you need.\n \n  Managing reactions specific to immunotherapy\n \n  Your cancer care team will tell you about the immunotherapy you will be receiving and possible reactions or side effects you might have. Report all side effects you are experiencing to your cancer care team so treatment can begin immediately. If you are having any side effects, your doctor may:\n  \n   \n   Prescribe medications to help with your symptoms.\n \n   Order lab tests or imaging tests such as x-rays or CT scan. Your doctor will probably continue to monitor your lab test results throughout your treatment. \n \n   Change your treatment dose.\n \n   Hold your treatment until the symptoms are better.\n \n   Permanently stop the drug if your symptoms are severe and could be life-threatening.\n \n  \n \n  What you can do\n    \n \n  Let your doctor or cancer care team know if you have any symptoms of reactions or side effects of immunotherapy so that treatment for the symptoms can start immediately if needed.\n   \n  Call your cancer care team right away if you notice any of the following symptoms\n \n   \n   Yellowing of the skin and whites of your eyes, pain on the right side of the abdomen, feeling drowsy, urine that is dark (tea-colored), loss of appetite, and bruising or bleeding that is happening more easily than normal\n \n   Fever, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, chest pain or cough. If you have difficulty breathing or chest pain, you may need to go to the nearest emergency center.\n \n   Nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. Try to drink fluids to stay hydrated.\n \n   New pain\n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  Let your cancer care team know if any of your side effects get worse or do not respond to the prescribed treatment."

        "text": "Leg Cramps\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n \n \n  \nCancer and its treatment may cause problems that lead to patients having leg and other types of muscle cramps.  Leg cramps or spasms are painful tightenings of the muscles in the leg, ankle, or foot. But it's important to know that other non-cancer related conditions and medicines can also cause problems that might cause leg cramps.\n \n   Some possible causes of leg cramps in people who have cancer include:\n \n   \n   Certain chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy drugs\n \n   Radiation therapy to the lower extremities (hips, legs, etc)\n \n   Some hormone drugs (tamoxifen or raloxifene) \n \n   Medications to treat bone loss\n \n   Tumors that start in a muscle or press on a muscle\n \n   Having too many white blood cells or treatment given for too few white cells\n \n   Staying in bed or being inactive for longer than usual\n \n   Overuse of certain muscles\n \n   Changes in the temperature around you\n \n   Peripheral neuropathy or other nerve damage\n \n   \n \n   Changes in electrolyte (blood chemistry) levels, especially phosphorus, calcium, glucose (sugar), or potassium\n \n   Non-cancer health problems\n \n  \n    \n  What to look for\n \n   \n   Sudden pain or discomfort in a leg or foot and a tight or stiff muscle\n \n   Trouble moving the foot, or pain when moving the foot or leg\n \n   Changes in your quality of sleep if leg cramps happen at night.\n \n  \n \n  Managing leg cramps\n \n  Your health care team can create a plan to help improve your sleep and manage leg cramps. One way to manage severe or frequent leg cramps is with a temporary muscle relaxant that can be prescribed by your doctor.\n \n  What the patient can do\n \n   \n   Tell your health care team about any leg cramps. They may be able to give you medicine to help prevent or reduce them, or to manage the pain they cause.\n \n   Apply heat\n      or cold to legs when they cramp, if it’s OK with your health care team. Ask what kind of heat or cold is best to use and how long you should use it.\n \n  \n \n   \n   Keep warm, and change position often.\n \n   If you are bed-bound, try propping the covers up or using a bed cradle to protect the legs and feet from the weight of the blankets. A bed cradle is a support at the end of the bed that holds the sheets and blankets up off the legs and feet.\n \n   Exercise your legs in bed by bending and straightening them several times throughout the day. A caregiver can help move your legs for you if you can’t.\n \n   Gently stretching the muscles before lying down may help prevent cramping.\n \n  \n   \n   \n   Massage the leg, if it’s OK with your health care team.\n \n   When you have a cramp, sit up or stand up to stretch the tight muscle as much as you can without hurting it. For example, for a calf muscle cramp, try pointing the toes upward toward the knees, or walk around.\n \n   Follow your health care team’s instructions for correcting dehydration, or blood level imbalances in calcium, potassium, or phosphorus.\n \n  \n \n  What caregivers can do\n \n   \n   Help the patient gently stretch the tight muscle if they can’t.\n \n   Use heat, ice, or a cold washcloth to gently rub the cramped muscle if OK with the health care team and depending on which provides more comfort.\n \n   If medicines are prescribed to prevent cramping, be sure they are taken as directed and watch for dizziness or stumbling.\n \n  \n \n  Call the health care team if the patient\n   \n \n   \n   Has a cramped leg that becomes red, swollen, hard, tender or warm.\n \n   If the patient has pain in the chest, arm, back, shoulder, or jaw, sudden coughing, increased heart rate or feeling light-headed, this can be an urgent problem and you might need to go to the nearest hospital emergency room right away.\n \n   Has cramping that’s not relieved by cold, heat, massage, or by stretching the cramped muscle (as described above).\n \n   Has cramping that lasts for more than 6 to 8 hours.\n"

        "text": "Low White Blood Cell Counts (Neutropenia)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n \n \n  \nA lowered level of immunity is called . Certain diseases, including cancer, and certain treatments, including chemotherapy and radiation therapy, can cause some people to have immunosuppression. This is usually referred to as having a low white blood cell count, but you might hear other words to describe it too. \n \n  What is neutropenia?\n  \n  Neutropenia is defined as a lower than normal number of neutrophils (a type of white blood cells). White blood cells are part of the immune system. There are different types of white blood cells, and they each have a key role in the body’s defense against germs:\n \n   \n   Neutrophils \n \n   Lymphocytes (which include T-lymphocytes and B-lymphocytes)\n \n   Monocytes\n \n   Macrophages\n \n  \n \n  Neutrophils are key infection-fighters\n \n   Neutrophils form a very important defense against most types of infection. Normally, most of our white blood cells are neutrophils. In patients with cancer, neutropenia is usually caused by treatment. When looking at your risk of getting an infection, doctors look at the number of neutrophils you have.  \n \n  If your neutrophil count is low, the doctor may say you are .\n For most people with cancer, having a low neutrophil count is the biggest risk factor for getting a serious infection. Ask your doctor if your cancer treatment will cause your neutrophil count to drop.\n  \n  Lymphocytes can mark, signal, and destroy germs\n \n  Some treatments, most often those given during a bone marrow (stem cell) transplant, can cause a shortage of lymphocytes. B and T lymphocytes help fight viruses, but have different jobs:\n \n   \n   B-lymphocytes make special proteins called  \nthat recognize and kill certain germs. They also can mark germs to be destroyed by other cells.\n \n   T-lymphocytes make signaling substances called  that tell other cells what to do. They also destroy cells infected by viruses.\n \n  \n \n  Monocytes and macrophageshelp recognize invaders\n \n   \n   They help lymphocytes recognize germs.\n \n   They can surround and digest germs that have been coated by antibodies (the proteins made by B-lymphocytes).\n \n   They help fight bacteria, fungi, and parasites.\n \n  \n \n  What is an absolute neutrophil count (ANC)?\n \n  You might hear your doctor or nurse talk about your absolute neutrophil count or ANC. This is the number of neutrophils you have in a certain amount of blood. Your health care team will use your ANC to get an idea of how well your immune system might work during treatment. A blood test called a (CBC) is used to see how well your immune system is working. It measures your white blood cells (WBCs), and your cancer care team is able to figure out your ANC from your WBC count. Your cancer care team will use your ANC to get an idea of how your immune system is affected by treatment and how well it is working to protect you from infection.\n \n  As the ANC gets lower, the usual signs of infection, such as fever, pus, pain, swelling, and redness, may not show up when an infection starts. This is because these signs are caused by neutrophils fighting off germs, and if you don’t have enough neutrophils to fight infection, you won't produce the signs. This can make it hard to know if you have an infection. The good thing is that another WBC, called the monocyte, can still cause signs of infection in a person who has neutropenia. Sometimes in people with severe neutropenia a fever may be the only sign of an infection. The lower your ANC is and the longer it stays low, the higher your risk of infection will be. \n \n  Ask your doctor if your cancer treatment might cause your neutrophil count to drop. Your cancer care team will help you find the ANC on your lab results and can help explain more about it. \n \n  What can cause or increase the risk for neutropenia?\n \n   \n   Some types of chemotherapy \n \n   Radiation therapy\n \n   Bone marrow or stem cell transplant\n       \n  \n   Steroids \n \n  \n \n  Symptoms of neutropenia\n \n   \n   Fever\n \n   Chills\n \n   Mouth sores\n \n   Cough\n \n   Difficulty breathing\n \n   Abdominal or rectal pain\n \n  \n \n  Problems neutropenia might cause\n \n   \n   Increased risk for infection\n \n   In a person with a healthy immune system, the usual signs of infection may include fever, pus, pain, swelling, and redness. As the ANC gets lower, many of these signs may not show up when an infection starts. This is because these signs are caused by neutrophils fighting off germs, and you don’t have enough neutrophils to produce the signs.\n \n   Your cancer care team may have to delay your treatment or reduce your dose to prevent further neutropenia \n \n  \n \n  Treatment of neutropenia\n \n  Treatment may include one or a combination of the following:\n \n   \n   Myeloid growth factors: These are proteins that stimulate the bone marrow to produce more white blood cells to help the body fight infections. They are also known as  or .\n  Examples of drugs to increase growth factors include filgrastim (Neupogen), tbo-filgrastim (Granix), and pegfilgrastim (Neulasta)\n \n   Antibiotics may be given in certain instances to help prevent infection \n     \n \n   Cancer treatment may be delayed to give your body enough time to make more white blood cells and recover your ANC.\n \n  \n \n  Talk to your cancer care team about what to watch for. Call your doctor if you have a fever (your cancer care team will let you know what temperature they consider a fever) or any other symptoms of neutropenia.\n"

        "text": "Low Red Blood Cell Counts (Anemia)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n \n \n  \nWhat is anemia?\n \n  When you don’t have enough healthy red blood cells, you have a condition called anemia. This means . Hemoglobin is the part of the red blood cell (RBC) that carries oxygen to all the cells in your body. Anemia is a common side effect in patients with cancer. \n  \n  What causes anemia?\n \n  There are many different reasons a person with cancer might have anemia. Some common causes are:\n \n   \n   The cancer itself\n \n   Cancer treatment, such as radiation or chemotherapy\n \n   Blood loss (this can be bleeding from a tumor, bleeding from cancer cells getting into blood vessels, or bleeding caused by other conditions like heavy menstruation or bleeding from a stomach ulcer)\n \n   Missing certain vitamins or minerals in the diet because of not eating enough\n \n   Low iron levels in blood\n \n   Major organ problems (including severe heart, lung, kidney, or liver disease)\n \n   Red blood cells (RBCs) being destroyed by the body before they’re replaced\n \n   The body making fewer RBCs\n \n   Having chronic kidney disease\n \n   Having conditions like sickle cell disease or thalassemia (inherited disorders of red blood cells)\n \n   A combination of any of these factors\n \n  \n \n  Some risk factors may make a person with cancer more likely to have anemia. These include:\n \n   \n   Certain chemotherapy drugs such as platinum-based chemotherapy (this is a certain group of chemo drugs)\n \n   Certain tumor types (such as lung or ovary tumors)\n \n   Having a low hemoglobin level before you had cancer\n \n  \n \n  Symptoms of anemia\n \n  Anemia often starts slowly, so you may not notice symptoms at first. As your hemoglobin level gets lower you may have one or more of these symptoms:\n \n   \n   Fast heartbeat\n \n   Fast breathing rate\n \n   Shortness of breath (trouble breathing)\n \n   Trouble breathing when doing things like walking, climbing stairs, or even talking (exerting yourself)\n \n   Dizziness or lightheadedness\n \n   Chest pain\n \n   Swelling in the hands and/or feet\n \n   Color of skin, nail beds, mouth, and gums looking more pale than usual\n    \n \n   Extreme tiredness (fatigue)\n \n  \n \n   Anemia can range from mild to life-threatening, depending on your hemoglobin level and the symptoms you are experiencing. Some of these symptoms are more serious than others. Your doctor will explain your hemoglobin level and the severity of your anemia.\n       \n  If you have any of these symptoms, tell your doctor or nurse right away. If you can’t reach your cancer care team right away, you may need to get immediate care at an emergency room.\n \n  Let your cancer care team know if you have any other medical problems such as heart or lung disease, as this may make your symptoms from anemia worse. It’s important to watch for anemia and its symptoms throughout your treatment. Tell your cancer care team if you’re having any of the symptoms described here. Be sure to mention how the symptoms affect your day-to-day life. Doing so will help you get the treatment you need when you need it.\n \n  Tests for causes of anemia\n \n  A  is a blood test that measures your hemoglobin level and other characteristics of your red blood cells (such as their size). This test not only shows if you have anemia, but it can also help your doctor figure out what might be causing it.\n \n  You might also need other tests to help to find what is causing it. These could include:\n \n   \n    to check organ function and levels of vitamins and minerals\n \n   A blood test called  (Reticulocytes are very young red blood cells just released from the bone marrow, so this test shows how many new red cells your body is making.)\n \n   to make sure your bone marrow is working as it should\n \n   Blood tests to look at your\n \n   \n \n    (feces) to check for blood (called a  or )\n \n  \n \n  Your doctor or nurse can use the results of these tests, along with your medical information and a physical exam, to get an idea of what might be causing your anemia. Sometimes no cause can be found other than “anemia of chronic disease.” This type of anemia is often found in people with long-lasting problems like congestive heart failure, inflammatory diseases, or cancer.\n \n  Problems anemia can cause\n \n  The first thing the doctor needs to know is how severe your anemia is. Anemia can affect your quality of life and has been found to shorten survival in people with cancer. It can make you feel very tired because cells in your body can’t get enough oxygen. In some cases, this lack of oxygen may be bad enough to threaten your life. Anemia can also make your heart work harder. So if you already have a heart problem, anemia can make it worse. Anemia can also make it hard for you to breath normally, making it challenging to do your usual activities.\n \n  Severe anemia may mean you have to delay your cancer treatment or have your treatment dose reduced. It can also cause some cancer treatments to not work as well as they should.\n \n  Your cancer care team may try to figure out your risk of serious problems from the anemia based on any symptoms you are having and your hemoglobin level. If you’re not having symptoms, they will try to figure out how likely you are to have them in the near future. This will be based on a number of things, including:\n \n   \n   Your hemoglobin level and other lab results\n \n   The type of cancer treatments you’ve had in the past\n \n   The chances that any treatments you’re now getting could make the anemia worse\n \n   Whether you have lung, heart, or blood vessel (circulation) problems\n \n   Your age\n \n  \n \n  If you don’t seem to be at risk for problems from anemia, your cancer care team will watch your hemoglobin level closely and ask about symptoms each time you visit the office.\n    \n   \n  \n         \n  Treatments for anemia \n \n  Anemia in cancer patients is usually treated based on the cause. Sometimes, treatment of anemia delays cancer treatment until your red blood cells recover. There are 2 main goals in treating anemia:\n \n   \n   Treat the cause of the anemia\n \n   Raise the hemoglobin level so that symptoms get better\n \n  \n \n  The most common treatments of anemia in patients with cancer include:\n \n   \n   Iron therapy\n \n   Red blood cell transfusion, commonly known as blood transfusion\n \n   Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs)\n \n   Other drugs \n \n  \n   \n  Your doctor will look at your test results, symptoms, how long you've been having the symptoms, the cancer type, cancer treatment, and other factors. Talk to your cancer care team about what treatment is right for you. As with any medical problem, the expected benefits of treatment should always outweigh the possible risks.\n \n  Iron therapy\n \n  If your iron levels are low, your doctor may supplement them with iron pills or iron given through your veins (iron infusion). Iron infusions carry a risk of allergic reaction. Your doctor will discuss with you what form of iron would be best for your situation. Your doctor may also ask you to try to eat more iron-rich foods. There are two types of iron in food: heme and non-heme. \n \n  Heme iron is found in animal products. Heme iron is more easily absorbed by the body than non-heme iron. Examples of foods that contain heme iron are:\n \n   \n   Red meat\n \n   Fatty fish\n \n   Chicken and turkey\n \n  \n \n  Non-heme iron is found in plant-based foods. Examples of foods that contain high amounts of non-heme iron include: \n \n   \n   Dark green leafy vegetables such as spinach, kale, collard greens, or chard\n \n   Beans and lentils\n \n   Tofu\n \n   Fortified cereals\n \n   Dried fruits such as raisins, apricots,  and peaches\n \n   Enriched pasta and rice. \n \n  \n \n  Non-heme iron is best absorbed by the body when eaten at the same time as fruits and vegetables high in Vitamin C. Examples of foods high in vitamin C include\n \n   \n   Citrus fruits \n \n   Tomatoes \n \n   Dark green leafy vegetables\n \n   Berries. \n \n  \n       \n   \n \n  Blood transfusions to treat anemia\n \n  A blood cell transfusion is a safe and a common way to treat anemia in people with cancer. It  can help the patient feel better and helps  oxygen get to vital organs. While blood transfusions can help symptoms very quickly, sometimes the relief is temporary depending on the cause of anemia. \n \n  Whether a blood transfusion might be needed depends on how severe your symptoms are and your hemoglobin level. A transfusion might be done  if your hemoglobin level reaches a certain number or if your symptoms get too bothersome\n    \n \n  A blood transfusion requires careful matching of donated blood to the recipient’s blood. Blood products are tested to be sure they are safe and the same kind of blood type as the recipient. But, receiving a blood transfusion also has some risks\n \n   \n    : This happens when the patient’s immune system attacks proteins on the foreign blood cells. This often looks like an allergic reaction. Most of these reactions are minor and can be treated, but sometimes they can be more serious.\n \n   : This is one of the more serious risks. It can cause trouble breathing and require treatment in the hospital.\n \n   : The careful blood testing and screening that’s used today has greatly decreased the risk of infections.\n \n   This can happen if blood is given too quickly for the heart to handle it.\n \n   : People who get many blood transfusions may end up with too much iron, which would then need to be treated.\n \n  \n  \n  Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents(ESAs)\n  \n  Another way to treat anemia in some patients is to use drugs that tell the body to make more red blood cells. ESAs work like a hormone (called ) made by the kidneys to help the body make its own new red blood cells. If one of these drugs is recommended, your health care provider will talk to you about the risks and the benefits of the drug. These drugs can cause very serious side effects. Still, they can help patients getting chemotherapy have higher hemoglobin levels and need fewer blood transfusions. This may result in a gradual improvement of anemia-related symptoms.\n \n  ESAs are given as shots under the skin, and how long they take before they start working may be different for different patients. Talk to your doctor about the risks and benefits of the ESA you will be receiving..\n \n  Other drugs to treat anemia\n \n  Depending on the type of anemia you have, the anemia may also be treated with vitamin B12 or folic acid supplementation.\n \n  Talk to your doctor about what kind of anemia you have, the recommended treatment, and the risks and benefits of the treatment.\n   \n        \n   Managing anemia at home\n \n   What to look for\n \n    \n    New or worsening tiredness that makes it harder to do your regular activities\n \n    Chest pain or shortness of breath when you’re active\n \n    Skin, nail beds, or gums that are more pale than usual\n \n    Dizziness\n \n    Weakness\n \n    Bright red, dark red, or black stool \n \n    Dark brown or bright red vomit\n \n   \n \n   (The last 2 are signs of bleeding, which can be a cause of anemia.)\n \n   What the patient can do\n \n    \n    Balance rest and activities. Only do activities that you can tolerate\n \n    Keep a log of your symptoms, what time they occur, and what makes them worse or better, and discuss with your health care provider at your appointment\n \n    Tell your cancer team if you’re not able to get around as well as usual.\n \n    Plan your important activities when you have the most energy.\n \n    Eat a balanced diet that includes protein (such as fish, meat, eggs, cheese, milk, nuts, peas, and beans). Try to include iron-rich foods in your diet\n \n    Drink 8 to 10 glasses (8 oz) of water a day, unless you are given other instructions by your cancer care team. It’s OK to drink other liquids instead of water – just not beer, wine, or other alcoholic drinks. Check with your doctor to see what a safe amount of liquids is for you.\n \n   \n \n   What caregivers can do\n \n    \n    Schedule friends and family members to prepare meals, clean the house, do yard work, or run errands for the patient. You can use websites that help organize these things, or get someone else to look into this for you.\n \n    Watch for confusion, faintness, or dizziness.\n \n   \n \n   Call the cancer care team if the patient\n \n    \n    Has chest pains\n \n    Has shortness of breath when resting\n \n    Feels dizzy or faint\n \n    Gets confused or can’t concentrate\n \n    Has not been able to get out of bed for more than 24 hours\n \n    Has blood in their stool\n \n    Has dark brown or bright red vomit\n"

        "text": "Low Platelet Count (Bleeding)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n \n \n  \n \n   Platelets are blood cells called thrombocytes and help your blood clot, so you stop bleeding. Low platelet count is also called . When your platelet levels are lower than normal, your blood isn’t able to clot as it should, putting you at a higher risk for excessive bleeding. The lower your platelet count, the higher your risk for bleeding. Your doctor will tell you what level is considered a low platelet count. If you have a very low platelet count, sometimes your doctor will delay your treatment or reduce your dose. Your doctor will use a blood test called  a  to measure your platelet level\n  \n   Causes of low platelet count\n \n   Your platelet count may be low if the body is not making enough platelets, losing platelets, or platelets are being destroyed. In patients with cancer, low platelet count may be caused by:\n \n    \n    Certain types of cancer: patients with lymphomas or leukemias may be at higher risk for low platelet counts\n \n    Certain types or cancer treatment, such as chemotherapy or radiation therapy that is used in large amounts or in combination with chemotherapy\n \n    Sometimes the proteins in your body called antibodies may attack and destroy platelets\n \n    Another health problem or medication that is not related to your cancer\n \n   \n \n   Symptoms of low platelet count\n \n   If your platelet levels drop, you may begin to notice one or more of these symptoms\n \n    \n    Bleeding from anywhere (such as the mouth, nose, or rectum)\n \n    Bloody or dark brown spit or vomit \n \n    Bright red, dark red, or black stools \n     \n \n    Red, pink, or brown urine \n \n    Women may have heavy vaginal bleeding during monthly periods\n \n    New unexplained bruises on the skin\n \n    Red pinpoint dots on the skin, usually starting on feet and legs\n \n    Bad headaches, dizziness, or blurred vision\n \n    Weakness that gets worse\n \n    Pain in joints or muscles\n \n   \n \n   Call your cancer care team right away if you notice any of these symptoms.\n \n   Platelet transfusion in patients with low platelet counts\n \n   A platelet transfusion might be needed in some patients with cancer who have a low platelet count. Platelets may be given to prevent bleeding when the platelet count is very low, or they may be given if a patient has some unusual bleeding to help stop it.\n \n   Before platelets are given, the donor is carefully matched to the patient and the platelets are screened so they are safe. But, receiving a platelet transfusion has some risks:\n \n    \n    : This happens when the patient’s immune system attacks proteins on the foreign blood cells. This often looks like an allergic reaction. Most of these reactions are minor and can be treated, but sometimes they can be more serious\n \n     is one of the more serious risks. It can cause trouble breathing and require treatment in the hospital.\n \n    such as HIV, hepatitis B, or hepatitis C. But the careful screening that’s used today has greatly decreased the risk of infections.\n \n   \n \n   Talk to your doctor about whether you have a risk for a low platelet count, and what options might be best for your situation.\n \n   What a patient with a low platelet count can do\n \n    \n    Use only an electric razor (not blade) for shaving.\n \n    Avoid contact sports (such as wrestling, boxing, or football) and any other activities that might lead to injury or cause a fall.\n \n    Protect your skin from cuts, scrapes, and sharp objects.\n \n    Use a soft toothbrush.\n \n    If your mouth is bleeding, rinse it a few times with ice water.\n \n    Talk to your cancer care team about whether you should put off flossing your teeth until your platelet counts improve.\n \n    Do not blow your nose or cough with great force.\n \n    Use a stool softener to avoid constipation and straining during a bowel movement. Do not use enemas or suppositories of any kind. Check with your cancer care team before using laxatives.\n \n    Do not put anything in your rectum, including suppositories, enemas, thermometers, etc.\n \n    Stay away from anti-inflammatory pain medicines, such as aspirin, naproxen, or ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil, Naprosyn, Aleve, Midol) and medicines like them unless your cancer team tells you to use them. Check with your pharmacist if you’re not sure whether a medicine is in this class of drugs, or if it contains one of them.\n \n    If bleeding starts, stay calm. Sit or lie down and get help.\n \n    Call your cancer care team or get immediate medical help if you have unusual bleeding or if bleeding of any kind does not stop.\n \n   \n \n   What caregivers can do\n \n    \n    Keep the home environment safe to help prevent injury and falls.\n \n    For nosebleeds, have the patient sit up with head tilted forward, to keep blood from dripping down the back of the throat. Put ice on the nose and pinch the nostrils shut for 5 minutes before releasing them. Ice on the back of the neck may also help.\n \n    For bleeding from other areas, press on the bleeding area with a clean, dry washcloth or paper towel until bleeding stops.\n"

It often happens in the arms or legs, but can also happen in the face, neck, trunk, abdomen (belly), or genitals.\n \n  It's important to know that lymphedema can sometimes become severe and cause serious problems, and often is a long-term or chronic condition. This is why early and careful management is needed to help reduce symptoms and keep it from getting worse.\n \n  What is the lymph system?\n \n  The lymph (or lymphatic) system is part of your body's immune system. It is a network of lymph nodes, ducts or vessels, and organs that work together to collect and carry clear lymph fluid through the body tissues to the blood. This is much like how veins collect blood from distant parts of the body (like the hands and arms) and carry it back to the heart.\n \n   \n    circulates through the body and contains proteins, salts, and water, as well as white blood cells, which help fight infection.\n \n    have one-way valves that work with body muscles to help move the fluid through the body and control the flow.\n \n    are small, bean-sized glands along the lymph vessels that work to help filter foreign substances, such as tumor cells and infections. Lymph nodes are  in many parts of the body, including the neck, armpit, chest, abdomen (belly), and groin.\n \n   The , and  are also parts of the lymph system.\n \n  \n   \n         \n  \n \n \n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n \n \n  \nHow does lymphedema start?\n \n  Lymphedema can occur when the lymph system is damaged, which can prevent the lymph fluid from returning to the blood. For people with cancer, the build-up of lymph fluid can be caused by:\n \n   \n   Cancer surgery, especially when lymph nodes are removed\n \n   Radiation therapy that can damage nearby lymph nodes or lymph vessels\n \n   Infections that damage surrounding tissue or cause scarring\n \n   Other health conditions, such as heart or vascular disease, arthritis, and eczema\n \n   Gene changes or mutations that involve the lymph system\n \n   Injury or trauma to a certain area of the body\n \n   Increased white blood cells from leukemia\n \n  \n \n  What are signs and symptoms of lymphedema?\n \n  It’s important to know the signs and symptoms of lymphedema, so it can be recognized and treated right away. \n \n  Common signs and symptoms of lymphedema can include:\n \n   \n   Swelling in part of the body (such as your breast, chest, shoulder, arm, or leg)\n \n   Skin feeling tight or hard, changing in texture, looking red, or feeling hot\n \n   New aching, tingling, numbness, or other discomfort in the area. The area might also feel full or heavy.\n \n   Less movement or flexibility in nearby joints (such as your hand, wrist, or shoulder)\n \n   Trouble fitting your arm into a jacket or sleeve, or trouble fitting into or buttoning your pants\n \n   Collars, rings, watches, and/or bracelets feeling tight even though you haven’t gained weight\n \n  \n \n  Lymphedema often develops in the arms or legs when surgery or other treatment affects those areas, but it can develop in other parts of the body, too.\n \n   \n   If lymphedema develops after breast cancer treatment, it can affect the breast, chest, and underarm, as well as the arm closest to the surgery.\n \n   After cancer in the abdomen (belly) or pelvis has been treated, lymphedema may appear as swelling of the abdomen, genitals, or one or both legs.\n \n   Treatment of tumors in the head and neck area might lead to lymphedema in the face and neck.\n \n  \n \n  What are the stages of lymphedema?\n    \n \n  The severity of lymphedema is often described by its stage:\n \n   No swelling, but subtle symptoms such as feeling the affected area is heavy or full, or that the skin is tight \n \n   Swelling of the affected area. There is increased size or stiffness of the arm or leg or affected area. For the arms or legs, the swelling improves when the arm or leg is raised.\n \n   More swelling than stage 1, which does not improve when the arm or leg is elevated. The affected area is hard and larger in size than stage 1.\n \n  Much more swelling than stage 2. The swelling might be so severe that you cannot lift or move the arm or leg on your own without using your other arm. The skin can become very dry and thick. The swelling can cause fluid to leak from the skin or blisters to form.\n \n  There is more risk for infection in the affected area that is at the later stages, such as stage 2 or 3.\n \n  \n \n  Know the signs of cellulitis\n \n  Cellulitis is an infection in the tissues just under your skin. It can lead to lymphedema. \n \n  Signs and symptoms of cellulitis include redness, warmth, pain, and possibly cracking or peeling of the skin in the area that's infected. Fever and flu-like symptoms may also be present. If it becomes a repeated problem, antibiotics may be needed to keep it under control. \n \n  Lymphedema can also lead to cellulitis,\n so it is important to watch for signs and symptoms. \n"

        "text": "For People at Risk of Lymphedema\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n \n \n  \nLymphedema that is related to cancer is most commonly caused by lymph node removal during surgery for cancer, radiation treatment to the lymph node area, and/or by the tumor itself, which might block part of the lymph system. Increased white blood cells due to leukemia or infectioncan also limit lymph flow and cause lymphedema.\n  \n  People who have  and/or  have a higher risk of long-term lymphedema. But at this time there’s no way to predict who will develop it.\n \n  Lymphedema can become a problem after surgery or radiation treatment for nearly any type of cancer, but it’s most common  in:\n \n   \n   \n \n   \n \n   Pelvic area cancers (such as bladder, penile, testicular, endometrial, vulvar, or cervical cancer)\n \n   \n \n   \n \n   \n \n  \n \n  Depending on where the lymphedema is, it can cause different signs or symptoms.\n     \n  Can lymphedema be prevented?\n \n  There is no sure way to prevent  lymphedema related to cancer. However, doctors can sometimes use  a surgical technique to remove fewer lymph nodes, which can help  lower the risk of lymphedema.\n  \n  Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB)  is a procedure used to find lymph nodes the tumor drains into so they can be removed and checked for cancer. SLNB checks only the lymph nodes the cancer would most likely go to first. If cancer is not found in these nodes, this procedure helps to limit the number of lymph nodes removed, so the risk of lymphedema might be lower.\n          \n  How can I  help reduce my risk for lymphedema?\n \n  There is no sure way to prevent lymphedema related to cancer, but there are ways to help lower your risk for it, and to reduce the chance of it  worsening.\n \n  Get regular medical check-ups\n \n  If you’ve had cancer surgery or other treatments that put you at increased risk for lymphedema, regular check-ups should include screening for lymphedema. Screening is for people who have not noticed or reported symptoms.\n \n  Your doctor or a certified lymphedema specialist might get baseline measurements of your arm or leg or the affected part of your body after you finish your cancer treatment. They will continue to measure the affected area at your follow-up visits to see if they are getting bigger (which might be a sign of lymphedema). Talk to your cancer care team about how often you should be checked.\n \n  Report any changes to your doctor\n \n  Healing and recovery from surgery or other treatments for cancer take time. As you heal, you will learn how the affected part of your body looks and feels. Be sure to let your cancer care team know if you notice any changes that are concerning, such as  any changes in size, color, temperature, feeling, or skin condition.\n \n  Get to and/or stay at a healthy weight\n \n  Being obese (very overweight) puts people at higher risk for lymphedema, and obesity can make it harder to treat lymphedema. Talk to your cancer care team about what a healthy weight is for you. Get their advice on how to get to and/or stay at that weight.\n \n  Exercise\n \n  It’s important to use the part of your body that’s affected by cancer for normal, everyday activities. This will help you heal properly and regain strength. Using your muscles also helps the lymph fluid circulate and drain like it should. It also helps keep your muscles flexible and helps reduce scarring.\n \n  Work with a trained fitness or certified lymphedema specialist  to design an exercise plan that’s right for you and starts at a low level of intensity and progresses slowly to avoid overuse Contact the American Physical Therapy Association (APTA) at www.apta.org or 1-800-999-2782 to find a physical therapist near you who works with people who have been treated for  cancer.\n \n  Avoid skin infections, burns, and injuries\n \n  Your body responds to infection, burn, or injury to the skin by sending extra fluid and white blood cells to the area. If lymph nodes and vessels are missing or damaged, it’s harder for your body to move this extra fluid, which can trigger or worsen lymphedema.\n \n  Be careful with injections or blood draws\n \n  If the lymph nodes under your arm were treated as part of the treatment for cancer, some doctors recommend having blood drawn, IVs, and shots done in the unaffected arm if possible. Some also recommend getting flu shots and other vaccinations in the unaffected arm or somewhere else, like the hip. But not all experts agree with this restriction. And if the lymph nodes under both arms were treated, it's not possible to have an unaffected arm. \n \n  Watch for signs of cellulitis\n \n  Cellulitis is an infection in the tissues just under your skin. It can lead to lymphedema.\n \n  Signs and symptoms of this problem include redness, warmth, pain, and possibly cracking or peeling on the skin in the area that's infected. Fever and flu-like symptoms may also be present. If it becomes a repeated problem, antibiotics may be needed to keep it under control.\n \n  Lymphedema can also put you at risk of getting cellulitis. \n   \n  Avoid tight or restrictive clothing or jewelry\n \n  Wearing tight or restrictive clothing or jewelry can squeeze the arm or leg unevenly or too much, which might increase the pressure in nearby blood and lymph vessels. This can lead to increased fluid and swelling (much like water building up behind a dam). Some people have linked this with the start of lymphedema.\n \n  \n     \n  \n       \n  Ask about compression garments\n \n  Compression garments are fitted sleeves or stockings that apply a specific amount of even pressure that can help prevent swelling by moving lymph fluid from the arm or leg back into the body. A lymphedema specialist or doctor will know how much pressure is right for your situation. Careful fitting is needed for a compression garment, and it's very important to follow your health care team’s advice on getting fitted, using, and caring for the garment.\n \n  . But if you’re at risk for lymphedema, you might want to ask about using one to help lower your risk in certain situations. For example, the risk for lymphedema might increase with long air travel, possibly because of air pressure changes. But there are risks and benefits to using a compression garment on long or frequent flights. Ask your doctor or lymphedema specialist if you should be fitted for a garment to wear during air travel. You might also want to discuss ways to safely move and exercise your affected body part during long flights.\n \n \n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n \n \n  \nBe sure compression garments fit well and are worn properly\n \n  Even if you don't have lymphedema, do not use a poorly fitting compression garment under any circumstance. This may increase your risk for lymphedema.\n \n  You usually don’t need a compression garment to prevent lymphedema during exercise, but it is best to talk to your doctor or lymphedema specialist before starting an exercise program.\n    \n"

        "text": "For People with Lymphedema\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n \n \n  \nLymphedema that is related to cancer is most commonly caused by lymph node removal during surgery for cancer, radiation to the lymph node area, and/or by the tumor itself which might block part of the lymph system. Increased white blood cells due to leukemia or an infection can also limit lymph flow and cause lymphedema.\n \n  Acute (short-term) lymphedema\n \n  Lymphedema can start soon after treatment for cancer. This can be called ,  orshort-term lymphedema.It usually starts within days, weeks, or a few months (up to a year) after treatment, is usually mild, and goes away on its own or with some mild treatments.\n \n   The swollen area may look red and feel hot, which could be a sign of a blood clot, infection, or other problem that needs to be checked and treated.\n \n  If there are no other problems causing the swelling, short-term lymphedema might be treated by raising the arm or leg, or doing light exercises.\n \n  Chronic (long-term) lymphedema\n \n  This form of lymphedema develops over time. . The swelling can range from mild to severe. The lymph fluid that collects in the skin and underlying tissues can be very uncomfortable. It can also keep nutrients from reaching the cells, interfere with wound healing, and lead to infections.\n \n  Lymphedema can be a long-term problem, but there are ways to manage it. The key is to know what to look for, and then to get help right away when you first notice signs and symptoms. \n \n  Treatment of lymphedema\n \n  When you have lymphedema, treatments can help reduce the swelling, keep it from getting worse, and decrease the risk of infection. Treatment is prescribed by your doctor, and you should talk to and be monitored by a certified lymphedema therapist (CLT). \n \n  Some common types of treatment for lymphedema include:\n \n   This is a type of massage done by a specialist to move the extra fluid to other parts of the body and decrease the lymphedema.\n \n   This treatment, also done by a specialist, involves skin care, MLD, special compression bandaging, exercises, and elevating the affected part of the body. Daily CDT is used to lower fluid volume as much as possible and can take a few weeks.\n \n   This treatment is another form of compression that uses a device that fills with air and then deflates off and on (like a blood pressure cuff) to move the extra fluid out of the affected area. \n \n   A certified lymphedema specialist can measure you for a compression garment that fits just right. When the lymphedema is controlled as much as possible, for example after regular MLD or daily CDT, a compression garment is then used to help keep it under control.\n \n   If the lymphedema can’t be controlled with the measures above, surgical procedures such as lymphatic bypass, lymph node transfer, or liposuction might be considered. These types of surgeries have their own possible complications, so they should be done at centers that are experienced in doing them for people with cancer.\n   \n  Although most insurance companies will pay for lymphedema treatment, some don’t cover the cost of compression garments and dressings. Check with your health insurance company to see what's covered. \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  Tips for people with lymphedema \n \n   \n   Avoid over-using your affected arm.\n \n   Look closely at your body in front of a mirror. Compare both sides of your body and look for changes in size, shape, or skin color. Let your doctor or nurse know if you notice any of the signs or symptoms of worsening lymphedema.\n \n   Practice good skin care. When you have lymphedema, your risk of infection is higher. Keep your skin clean and dry and use moisturizers regularly to keep your skin from cracking. Also, protect your body from the sun. Use a broad spectrum sunscreen that is labeled SPF of at least 30 and try to stay out of the sun between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m., when the ultraviolet (UV) rays are strongest.\n \n   Ask to be referred to a certified lymphedema therapist. \n \n   Be sure compression garments fit well and are worn properly. Do not use a poorly fitting compression garment under any circumstances. This may make lymphedema worse.\n \n   If your arm starts to ache, lie down and raise it above the level of your heart.\n \n   Regular exercise is a key part of lymphedema management, but be sure to talk to your doctor or therapist to learn what type of exercise program is right for you.\n \n   It helps to talk to people who understand what you’re going through. Find support groups in your area, call us at 800-227-2345 or go to Lymphology Association of North America (LANA) online at www.clt-lana.org.\n \n  \n \n  Tips if your arm has lymphedema and is swollen:\n \n   \n   Wear loose jewelry, clothing, bras, and gloves. Avoid anything that fits too tightly or puts pressure around your chest, arm, or wrist. Clothing and compression garments should be supportive and have smooth, even compression.\n \n   Do not use shoulder straps when carrying briefcases and purses.\n \n   Wear a loose-fitting bra with padded straps that don’t dig into your shoulder. Make sure underwires don’t put pressure on your breast or chest. After a mastectomy, use a lightweight prosthesis (breast form). A heavy prosthesis might put too much pressure on the area.\n \n   Many doctors recommend that you have your blood pressure checked on the unaffected arm, if possible. If both arms are affected, blood pressure can be taken on your thigh. Or, you can ask that blood pressure be measured by someone using a hand pump and stethoscope rather than using a machine, as the machines often use high pressures for a longer time. You should also be careful with injections or blood draws. For more information on injections and blood draws, see For People at Risk of Lymphedema.\n \n  \n \n  Tips if your lower body or leg has lymphedema and is swollen:\n \n   \n   Wear loose clothing. Avoid anything that fits too tightly or puts pressure around your waist, legs, or genitals, such as undergarments or pants with tight elastic bands.\n \n   Wear well-fitting, closed shoes instead of sandals or slippers. Do not go barefoot.\n \n   Keep your feet clean and dry. Wear soft protective socks (cotton or padded types). \n \n   Some people at risk of leg lymphedema might benefit from wearing a compression stocking when up and walking around. A  can help squeeze the lymph fluid through the remaining vessels before it builds up. The stocking must be well fitted to apply the right pressure while avoiding too much tightness near the top of the stocking. Ask your doctor, nurse, or therapist if you should be fitted for a compression stocking.\n \n   Avoid socks or stockings with tight elastic bands.\n \n   Try not to stand or sit in one place for too long (more than 30 minutes). Do not cross your legs when sitting.\n \n  \n \n  What caregivers can do\n \n   \n   Watch the skin area for early signs of infection, like pus coming from a cut or scrape, rash, red blotches or streaks, swelling, increased heat, tenderness, chills, or fever. Call the health care team right away if you notice any of these symptoms.\n \n   Help make the home environment safe from possible falls to prevent skin injury or fractured bones.\n \n   If the patient has pets, keep the pets’ claws trimmed to avoid scratching the patient's skin.\n \n   Avoid the patient being exposed to extreme temperatures. Ice packs or heating pads may damage skin tissue and increase fluid build-up, so talk to the doctor before using either of these.  \n \n  \n \n  Call the health care team if ...\n \n  Call your doctor, nurse, physical therapist, or lymphedema therapist if you notice any of the signs or symptoms of lymphedema listed  or any of these changes:\n \n   \n   Part of the affected area, such as an arm or a leg, feels hot, looks red, or swells up suddenly. These could be signs of infection (cellulitis) or a blood clot, and you might need treatment right away.\n \n   You have a temperature that's not related to a cold or the flu, and that's above what's considered normal for you or above a certain level as instructed by the cancer care team.\n \n   You have new pain with no known cause in the affected area.\n \n  \n \n  To find a certified lymphedema therapist contact:\n \n  Lymphology Association of North America (LANA) www.clt-lana.org\n \n  National Lymphedema Network (NLN) 1-800-541-3259 www.lymphnet.org"

        "text": "Mouth Sores and Pain\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n \n \n  \nMouth sores are areas that might look like little cuts or ulcers in the mouth (also known as mucositis or stomatitis). This is because certain kinds of cancer treatment can damage the cells that line the mouth, throat, and gastrointestinal (GI) tract. This causes sores or ulcers to develop in the affected areas. In some cases, the soreness and sores may extend into the throat and farther down into the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, making eating and swallowing painful. Mouth sores can appear 1 to 2 weeks after treatment starts and may come and go if treatment is given in cycles. Some treatments are more likely to cause mouth sores than others. \n \n  The treatments and other factors that most commonly cause mouth sores include:\n \n   \n   Certain kinds of chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and some immunotherapy drugs\n \n   Radiation treatments to the head and neck area\n \n   Certain infections\n \n   \n \n   Poor mouth care\n \n   Oxygen therapy\n \n   Alcohol or tobacco use\n \n   Lack of certain vitamins or protein\n \n  \n \n  Healing may take 2 to 4 weeks when treatment completely ends. Mouth sores can be very painful and lead to dehydration, poor eating, and weight loss. They can also be costly to treat if they cause serious problems.\n \n  What to look for\n \n   \n   Sores in the mouth that may be red, or may have small white patches in the middle. They may bleed or become infected.\n \n   Swelling in the gums, mouth, or throat\n \n   Pain or discomfort when you chew or swallow. This may also feel like a sore throat.\n \n   Small ulcers, bleeding, or sores in mouth, on gums, or on or under tongue\n \n   A white or yellow film, patches, or pus in the mouth or on the tongue\n \n   Increased mucus in the mouth\n \n   Feeling of dryness, mild burning, or pain when eating hot and cold foods\n \n   Heartburn or indigestion\n \n  \n \n  Treatment of mouth sores and pain\n \n  Dental checkups before treatment, and especially before head and neck radiation therapy, can help prevent and minimize mouth sores. Dentists can help show you how to care for your mouth  and can treat cavities or oral infections before cancer treatment starts. It's important to talk to your cancer care team about the best treatment for your situation. Although more research is needed to find the best treatment plan to manage mouth sores and pain, some options might include good mouth care and mouth rinses, reducing treatment doses, cryotherapy, or laser therapy.\n \n  Good mouth care and mouth rinses\n \n  Good mouth care is key to help reduce the risk or severity of mouth sores. Using a soft toothbrush or foam swab can help keep the mouth clean and reduce the risk of injuring your gums and lining of the mouth. If you use dental floss, ask your doctor if you should stop or if you can continue to floss.\n \n  Certain types of rinses can help to keep your mouth clean and can help soothe discomfort. Ask your doctor which type of rinse may be best for your situation. For example, baking soda, salt water, or saline rinses might be recommended. Mouth rinses with antibiotic agents or steroids might be recommended, depending on how severe the mouth sores are.\n \n  Benzydamine (an anti-inflammatory drug) may help prevent mouth sores in people getting radiation treatment to the mouth or throat. Morphine rinses may help relieve pain from mouth sores in this same group of people. Dexamethasone (a steroid) has been used in mouth rinses to help with cleansing and discomfort.\n \n  Another type of mouth rinse, often referred to as \"magic mouthwash\" might be recommended by your doctor. Magic mouthwash is a mixed medication mouthwash that combines a few different medicines. But, there is not one single combination that's used by all doctors, and some experts don't recommend a combination. Some common ingredients of magic mouthwash include diphenhydramine, viscous lidocaine, aluminum hydroxide, nystatin, and corticosteroids.\n \n  \n \n  Medication\n \n  Certain vitamins or supplements may be helpful for mouth sores, but it's important to talk to your doctor before using any.\n \n  Prescribed medication for mouth sores might include:\n \n   \n   Pain medications, used for discomfort but won't help to heal mouth sores\n \n   Steroids or non-steroid anti-inflammatory medications that may help both healing and discomfort\n \n   Palifermin, a growth factor drug that helps stimulate oral tissue has been used in some patients getting radiation to the head and neck, and some who are receiving high-dose chemotherapy or stem cell transplant.\n \n  \n \n  Cryotherapy\n \n  When cryotherapy is used, the patient sucks on ice chips before, during, and after short infusions of certain chemotherapy treatments. Some studies have shown this to help prevent mouth sores by decreasing tissue blood flow and limiting high chemical exposure from treatment.\n \n  Low-level laser therapy\n \n  Research shows that using low-level laser therapy (LLLT) may help prevent mouth sores that can result from stem cell transplant and radiation to the head and neck. More studies are being done to find out if low-level laser therapy can be used in other types of treatment.\n \n   \n  \n \n  What the patient can do\n \n  Check your mouth twice a day using a small flashlight, mirror, and a padded Popsicle stick. If you wear dentures, take them out before you check your mouth. Tell your health care team if your mouth looks or feels different or if you notice changes in how things taste.\n \n  \n \n  For example, your cancer care team might recommend doing mouth care 30 minutes after eating and every 4 hours while you’re awake by using a soft toothbrush, non-abrasive toothpaste, and certain kind of alcohol-free mouthwash or special mouth rinse. Ask about whether you should floss or not.  If you have dentures, you may be instructed to remove and clean your dentures between meals on a regular time schedule, and to store them in cleansing soak. \n       \n  Other tips that might help include:\n \n   \n   Keeping your lips moist with petroleum jelly, a mild lip balm, or cocoa butter.\n \n   Drinking at least 2 to 3 quarts of fluids each day, if your health care team approves.\n \n   Asking about medicine that can be swished 15 to 20 minutes before meals or painted on a painful sore with a cotton swab before meals.\n \n   Asking about other medicines to relieve pain.\n \n   Eating chilled foods and fluids (such as Popsicles, ice chips, frozen yogurt, sherbet, or ice cream).\n \n   Eating soft, moist foods that are easy to swallow.\n \n   Using a straw.\n \n   Eating small, frequent meals of bland, moist, non-spicy foods. Avoid raw vegetables and fruits, and other hard, dry, or crusty foods, such as chips or pretzels.\n \n   Avoiding fizzy drinks, alcohol, and tobacco.\n \n   Not eating very salty, spicy, or sugary foods.\n \n   Avoiding acidic fruits and juices, such as tomato, orange, grapefruit, lime, or lemon.\n \n  \n  \n  What caregivers can do\n \n   \n   Use a flashlight to check the patient’s mouth for red areas or white patches, which often become sores. If the patient wears dentures, remove them before looking.\n \n   Offer liquids with a straw, which may help bypass the sores in the mouth.\n \n   Offer soft foods. Mash or puree foods in a blender to make them easier to eat.\n \n   Try coating mouth sores with Anbesol or Orajel before meals to numb them during eating, if OK with the cancer care team.\n \n   Offer pain medicines 30 minutes before mealtime.\n \n  \n \n  Call the health care team if the patient\n   \n \n   \n   Has redness or shininess in their mouth that lasts for more than 48 hours\n \n   Has bleeding gums\n \n   Notices any type of “cut” or sore in the mouth\n \n   Has a temperature of 100.5° F or higher when taken by mouth\n \n   Has white patches on the tongue or inside the mouth\n \n   Has taken in little food or fluid for 2 days\n \n   Can’t take medicines because of mouth sores\n"

        "text": "Mouth Dryness or Thick Saliva \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n \n \n  \nDry mouth, or , happens when there is not enough saliva or saliva becomes very thick. This can be a side effect of radiation therapy to the head and neck areas, some types of chemo, certain other medicines, and dehydration. The glands that make saliva can become irritated or damaged and make less saliva, or your saliva can become very thick and sticky. The level of dryness can be mild or severe.\n \n  Having a dry mouth or thick saliva can increase your risk of cavities and mouth infection. If you smoke, chew tobacco, or drink alcohol, the dryness can be worse.\n \n  What to look for\n \n   \n    Dried, flaky, whitish saliva in and around the mouth\n \n \n    Thick saliva that’s more like mucus and that sticks to lips when you open your mouth\n \n \n    Trouble swallowing foods or thick liquids\n \n \n    Mouth always open to breathe (mouth-breathing dries out the mouth and throat)\n \n \n    Burning tongue\n \n \n    Bits of food or other matter on the teeth, tongue, and gums\n \n \n    Tongue surface looks ridged or cracked\n \n \n  \n \n  Treatment for dry mouth or thick saliva\n \n  Treatment for dry mouth and thick saliva includes increasing comfort and preventing infection or complications. Good mouth care and frequent sips of water are helpful ways to manage problems with dry mouth or thick saliva. Avoiding alcohol intake and tobacco, avoiding certain foods, and keeping caffeine and sugar (in candy, gum, or soft drinks) to a minimum can help keep a dry mouth and thick saliva from getting worse. If you are having trouble eating or are eating less, talk to your cancer care team about whether nutritional supplements may be helpful.\n \n  What the patient can do\n \n   \n   \n    Rinse your mouth every 2 hours with a solution recommended by your cancer care team.\n \n   Take small bites, and chew your food well.\n \n   Sip liquids with meals to moisten foods and help with swallowing.\n \n   Add liquids (such as gravy, sauce, milk, and yogurt) to solid foods.\n \n   Try ice chips, sugarless hard candies, and sugarless chewing gum.\n \n   Keep cold water nearby for frequent sips between meals and mouth rinses.\n \n   Rinse or spray mouth often using artificial saliva, which is sold in drugstores.\n \n   Use petroleum jelly, cocoa butter, or a mild lip balm to keep lips moist.\n \n   Suck on sugarless candy or chew sugarless gum to stimulate saliva. Citrus, cinnamon, and mint flavors often work well.\n \n   Use a cool mist humidifier to moisten room air, especially at night. (Be sure to keep the humidifier clean to avoid spreading bacteria or mold in the air.)\n \n   Avoid drinking alcohol.\n \n   Avoid tobacco.\n \n   Avoid hot, spicy, or acidic foods.\n \n   Avoid chewy candies, tough meats, pretzels and chips, and hard raw fruits or vegetables.\n \n   Avoid store-bought mouthwashes containing alcohol.\n \n  \n \n  What caregivers can do\n \n   \n   Offer small, soft meals with extra sauce or dressings for dipping.\n \n   Offer ice cream, gelatin desserts, ice chips, and frozen drinks.\n \n   Keep liquids nearby for frequent sipping.\n \n   Help the patient track their fluid intake, and encourage them to take in 2 to 3 quarts of liquid each day, if the care team approves. Ice, ice cream, sherbet, popsicles, and gelatin count as liquids.\n \n  \n \n  Call the cancer care team if the patient\n   \n \n   \n   \n \n   \n \n   Can’t take medicines or swallow pills\n \n   Has dry, cracked lips or mouth sores\n \n   Has a dry mouth that is a new symptom for more than 3 days\n"

        "text": "Nail Changes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n \n   \n  \nNails help protect the ends of our fingers and toes, and allow fingers to perform activities such as scratching or picking up things. Nails are normally present on each finger and toe. They are made up of the nail plate (the hardest part of the nail and the part that can be seen) and tissue that lies underneath the nail plate.\n \n  Nails receive blood and nutrition from the body. They are attached to the body by the nail bed which is kind of like a root and receives nutrients to keep the nails healthy and to allow new nail cells to form and grow. As they grow, the newer cells push out the older cells. The older cells are pushed forward and get flatter and harder which forms the nail plate. The nail plate does not have living cells which is why nails can be cut without pain. \n \n   are different problems that can happen to fingernails, toenails, or both. Certain types of cancer and cancer treatments can cause changes to the nails. The changes can happen in the nail bed or in the nail plate itself. Nail changes can be temporary or may last.\n \n  Types of nail changes\n \n  Depending on what is causing changes in your nails, you might notice changes in how they look, feel, and work. You might also notice changes in the tissue around or under your nails. Some common nail changes include:\n \n   \n   Changes in thickness and strength of nails causing nails to become weaker\n \n   Painful, delicate nailbeds, fingers, or toes\n \n   Dry or cracked skin in the cuticles around the nailbed\n \n   Changes in the color  of the nails or nailbeds (either discolored areas or over-pigmented, darker than usual areas)\n \n   Ridges, markings, pits, spots, splitting and other unusual or irregular marks in the nails\n    \n \n   Lifting of the nail plate off of the nailbed, or the nail plate falling off\n \n   Slower nail growth than usual , or temporary lack of growth .\n \n  \n   \n  Nail changes in people with cancer\n \n  Some treatments for cancer can cause damage or changes to nails. Usually the treatments that cause nail changes are medications, but radiation can also cause nail changes. Different treatments can affect normal cells, like nail cells, in different ways. And their side effects can also affect nails differently. One, two, a few, or all of your nails could be affected by changes. Some changes occur soon after you begin treatment, but others may happen weeks or months after treatment begins. Some might be temporary and others might be long-lasting or permanent.\n \n  Remember that while some cancers and cancer treatment can cause changes in your nails, non-cancer conditions and medications can also cause them. It's important to talk to your doctor about all medical problems you might have and about the medications, vitamins, minerals, and supplements you are taking so your risk can be discussed and you know what to expect. \n \n  Nail changes to look for\n \n   \n   : These look like bruises under the nails, and are usually along the bottom edge of the nail, near the cuticle. These kinds of color changes can be seen in nail cancer (called melanoma) and can also be a side effect of some types of drugs used to treat cancer.\n \n   Small thin cracks or deep cuts or tears in the finger tips, nail plate or bed, which can be very painful. \n \n    Tiny red lines in the nails that are tiny areas of bleeding under the nail plate. \n \n    Nail plates are usually translucent (clear). Some medications or radiation can cause a darkening of the skin, or nail itself. Usually this darkening is temporary, but sometimes it is permanent and can occur in some parts of the nail, or all over the nail. \n \n    Redness, and sometimes swelling of the nailbed and surrounding finger or toe, sometimes with an infection that is bacterial or fungal, which can be very painful and can limit your ability to do normal daily activities.\n \n    This is usually a temporary condition but can be upsetting. If the nail lifts away from the nailbed, it makes the nail likely to fall off, and it becomes a place where an infection could easily happen.\n \n    Complete loss of the nail plate. Some medications cause the nail plate to loosen entirely and be lost. This is temporary but can be painful and can increase the risk of infection.\n \n    Some medications cause different looking ridges or different colored lines in the nail plate. These may happen and remain throughout treatment and will usually grow out once the nail grows completely. Usually these types of changes are not painful.\n \n  \n \n  Cancer treatments that can cause nail changes\n  \n  Some medications used to treat cancer can stop the growth of nails altogether while you are taking them. If you are getting treatment in cycles, the nails may begin to grow a little in between the cycles, but may produce white horizontal lines in the nail plate, called Beau’s lines. These are harmless and will usually grow out once treatment is over.\n \n  Here are some of the changes you may have in your nails, and some of the drugs to treat cancer than can cause them. Being on more than one drug that can cause nail changes might increase how severe the side effects will be.\n \n  \n \n  Managing nail changes\n  \n  Many changes to nails that happen during cancer treatment can affect their appearance. For example, ridges or lines in your nails are not usually painful, but cause changes in how your nails look and feel. Once the treatment causing changes is done, the changes will usually go away over time as the nail grows out. The nail changes likely to be temporary include:\n \n   \n   Changes in nail color (dark areas; hyperpigmentation)\n \n   Splinter hemorrhages\n \n   Ridges, lines and creases in the nail\n \n  \n \n  For minor, non-painful nail changes, the following might be helpful:\n \n   \n   Protect splitting, ridges, and delicate nails by using a water-soluble nail lacquer, or a prescription nail polish (that your doctor can provide) to protect your nails.\n \n   Biotin (a dietary supplement) may be prescribed to strengthen your nails. Ask your doctor if it is safe for you to take biotin.\n \n  \n \n  Some changes, however, are painful or involve an infection, and require treatment.  Talk to your doctor about what is best for your situation before trying anything at home. \n \n   \n   Nail inflammation (paronychia): Treatment recommended by your doctor might include using a steroid ointment, and white vinegar and water soaks (1 part vinegar to 1 part water), disinfecting soaks, or oral anti-inflammatory medications, or antibiotics\n \n   Lifting of the nailbed (onycholysis): Surgical removal of part of the nail plate may be recommended to relieve pain.\n \n   Nail infections (bacterial or fungal): Antibacterial ointment may be recommended by your doctor and applied regularly to the nail and nailbed\n \n   Fissures (deep grooves that may open or cause nail splitting): Surgical removal of part of the nail plate may be recommended to relieve pain\n \n  \n            \n  What the patient can do\n \n  It may not be possible to prevent nail changes, but you can do some things to help manage minor nail changes, and to avoid making them worse. Some things you can do include:\n \n   \n   Check your hands and feet every day to look for changes in your nails.\n \n   Use a water-soluble nail lacquer on nails that have ridges, are delicate, or are splitting, to strengthen and protect them.\n \n   Let your health care team know as soon as you see nail changes.\n \n   Keep your nails trimmed short. Short nails are less likely to break or get caught.\n \n   Keep your nails clean to avoid infections\n \n   Protect your hands when putting them in water (such as washing dishes), gardening, or cleaning. Wear work gloves when doing these tasks to protect your nails\n \n   Do not get professional manicures while you are getting treatment for cancer\n \n   Wear loose-fitting shoes\n \n   Avoid pressure to your nail beds (both fingers and toes)\n \n   If you are taking a taxane drug (especially docetaxel), consider applying cold packs to nails for 15 minutes before the infusion of the drug, during the infusion, and for 15 minutes after the infusion. This may prevent nail lifting.\n \n  \n \n  It’s important to tell your health care team as soon as you notice any expected or unexpected changes to your nails. Prevention and avoiding injuries to your nails is an important part of keeping your nails as healthy as possible.\n \n  If you get medicine to treat your nail changes, be sure to tell your doctor how the medication is working for you or if new problems come up.\n \n  Questions to ask about nail problems\n \n  If you are concerned about nail problems or if you are at risk for nail changes, here are some questions to ask your health care team:\n \n   \n   Should I wear a protective nail lacquer? If not, why not?\n \n   Can I continue my current nail care and treatment? Be sure to explain if you get special salon treatments, such as acrylic or gel nails or polish.\n \n   Can my treatment cause nail changes? What changes should I expect?\n \n   When can I expect these changes to start? When will they end?\n \n   Is there anything I can do to avoid these changes?\n \n   If I notice a change in my nails, what should I do?\n \n   Are there other medications I should avoid if I have nail changes?\n \n   Will having nail changes cause me to have to slow down, pause, or stop my cancer treatment? If this happens, what are my choices?\n"

        "text": "Understanding Nausea and Vomiting\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n \n \n  \nNausea can be described as having a sick or uncomfortable feeling in the back of your throat and stomach. There are many other words describing the feeling of nausea, including \"sick to one's stomach\", \"queasy\", or \"upset stomach\". Other symptoms can happen at the same time as nausea, such as increased saliva (spit), dizziness, light-headedness, trouble swallowing, skin temperature changes, and a fast heart rate. \n \n  Vomiting is also described as “throwing up.” Nausea can lead to vomiting, and sometimes nausea and vomiting happen at the same time, but they can be totally separate problems, too. When you vomit, your stomach muscles contract (squeeze) and push the contents of your stomach (liquids and food) out through your mouth.\n \n  Retching is when your body tries to vomit without bringing anything up from your stomach. Other words used to describe retching are gagging or having the dry heaves.\n    \n  What causes nausea and vomiting in people with cancer?\n \n  Nausea and/or vomiting in the person with cancer can be caused by many different things, such as:\n \n   \n   Cancer treatments \n \n   The cancer itself, especially if it’s in or affecting the brain or abdomen (belly)\n \n   Other medicines given for health problems that are not cancer-related\n \n   Bowel slowdown or blockage (obstruction)\n \n   \n \n   Inner ear problems\n \n   An imbalance of minerals and salts (electrolytes) in the blood\n \n   \n \n   \n \n   The expectation of vomiting because of vomiting before in the same setting (this is called )\n \n   Other diseases or illnesses\n \n  \n \n  Not all people who get cancer treatments have nausea and/or vomiting. Your risk for having nausea or vomiting depends on the type of cancer being treated and the type and dose of treatment being given. \n \n  Chemotherapy and other drugs used to treat cancer travel throughout the body while radiation therapy treats one part of the body where the cancer is located. For this reason, chemotherapy and some other drugs used for cancer treatment cause more nausea and vomiting than radiation therapy. If you are getting  chemotherapy, you might hear your cancer care team refer to it as chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV). ﻿Your cancer care team knows which treatments have a higher risk for CINV because studies have shown that certain drugs used to treat cancer are more likely to cause nausea and vomiting than other others. Chemo and other drugs used to treat cancer are classified according to their emetogenic \npotential (how likely the drug will cause nausea or vomiting) as high, moderate, low, or minimal risk. Anti-nausea drugs are used to help control and even prevent nausea and vomiting depending on this risk. You may hear them called anti-emetics. \n \n  Every person with cancer who’s getting treatments that cause nausea or vomiting can, and should, get medicines to keep this from happening or to control it. Talk to your doctor for more information or if you have questions about your risk for nausea and vomiting.\n \n  What makes nausea and vomiting occur?\n \n  The exact way that nausea and vomiting occur is still not fully understood, but studies have shown a pathway in the brain that is triggered and sends signals to make it happen. When you are given cancer treatment that can cause nausea:\n \n   \n   A certain area of the brain is triggered and sends signals to other parts of the body\n \n   Certain areas of the esophagus (the tube that connects the mouth to the stomach), stomach, small intestine, and large intestine are triggered\n \n   These triggers activate a reflex pathway that leads to nausea and vomiting\n \n   Anti-nausea (anti-emetic) drugs to block different parts of this pathway can be used to control and prevent nausea and vomiting.\n \n  \n    \n  Health problems caused by nausea and vomiting \n \n  Nausea and vomiting are some of the most unpleasant side effects of cancer treatment, but they have become less of a concern due to more effective treatment for them. They rarely become life-threatening.\n \n  Still, nausea and vomiting can make it hard to get the nutrition your body needs. Nausea can make you not want to eat or drink anything, and repeated vomiting can lead to dehydration, which is a lack of fluids and minerals your body needs. If nausea and vomiting persist, they can quickly become a serious problem. Be sure to let your cancer care team know right away if either of these happen:\n \n   \n   You can’t keep fluids down\n \n   You’re vomiting for 24 hours or longer\n \n  \n \n  Vomiting can also cause tiredness (fatigue), trouble concentrating, slow wound healing, weight loss, and loss of appetite. It can interfere with your ability to take care of yourself and may lead to changes in your treatment plan.\n \n  Questions to ask  about nausea and vomiting\n \n  Ask your cancer care team these questions:\n \n   \n   Is my cancer treatment likely to cause nausea and vomiting?\n \n   Can my nausea and vomiting be prevented or controlled?\n \n   How will you decide which anti-nausea/vomiting treatments I should use?\n \n   How much will the anti-nausea medications cost?\n \n   Do the anti-nausea/vomiting treatments you want me to use have side effects?\n \n   When and how often should I take each medicine?\n \n   What will we do if the treatment doesn’t control my nausea and vomiting?\n \n   At what point do I need to call if I still feel nausea or still vomit after taking the medicine?\n"

        "text": "Nausea and Vomiting Caused by Cancer Treatment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n \n \n  \nCancer treatments, such as chemotherapy or radiation therapy can cause nausea and vomiting. Some other drugs, such as targeted therapy and immunotherapy can cause nausea and vomiting too. There many different kinds of each type of treatment. Some can make you have nausea and/or vomiting while others might not. Sometimes the type of cancer you have can make you have nausea and vomiting too.\n \n  How likely you are to have nausea and vomiting while getting treatment depends on many things. Some of these are:\n \n   \n   The types of treatment used. Drugs that travel through the body are more likely to cause nausea and vomiting than treatment that only affects one area of the body, such as radiation therapy. And, some drugs are more likely than others to cause nausea and vomiting\n \n   The dose of the drugs (higher doses can be more likely to cause nausea and vomiting, especially certain chemo drugs)\n \n   When and how often the drug is given. For example, if doses of a chemo drug that causes nausea and vomiting are given close together, there’s less time for the person to recover from the effects of the last dose before the next one is given.\n \n   How the drugs are given. For instance, chemo given through a vein (intravenous, or by IV) may cause nausea and vomiting much faster than a drug given by mouth. This is because the drug given by IV is absorbed faster.\n \n   Individual differences – not every person will have the same response to a dose or type of treatment.\n \n   Having a tumor in the brain, liver, or gastrointestinal tract may increase the risk for nausea and vomiting.\n \n   Other drugs (such as pain medicines) that may cause or worsen nausea and/or vomiting.\n \n  \n \n  Some personal risk factorsthat may make you more likely to have nausea and vomiting include:\n \n   \n   Being female\n \n   Being younger\n \n   Having had morning sickness during pregnancy\n \n   Being very anxious or nervous\n \n   Having ever had motion sickness\n \n   Being prone to vomiting when you are sick\n \n   Having been a non-drinker or light drinker (of alcohol)\n \n   Having had chemo in the past\n \n  \n \n  There’s no way to know for sure if you will have nausea and vomiting, but your doctor will consider these things when choosing anti-nausea and vomiting medicines to use with your cancer treatment.\n \n  Nausea and vomiting due to chemo and other drugs that treat cancer\n \n  You may hear treatment-related nausea and vomiting also referred to as chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV). If you're getting a drug to treat cancer, be sure to talk to your cancer care team about what kind of drug it is and how likely it is to cause nausea and vomiting.\n \n  There are different types of nausea and vomiting, depending on when they happen.\n \n   usually happens within minutes to hours after treatment is given, and usually within the first 24 hours. This is more common when treatment is given by IV infusion or when taken by mouth.\n \n   usually starts more than 24 hours after treatment and can last up to a few days after treatment ends. It’s more likely with certain types of chemo or other drug to treat cancer. Ask your doctor if the treatment you’re getting is known to cause delayed nausea and vomiting.\n \n   is a learned or conditioned response. It appears to be the result of previous experiences with treatment that led to nausea and vomiting, in which the brain pairs some parts of the treatment such as the sights, sounds, and smells of the treatment area with vomiting. Anticipatory nausea and/or vomiting can happen before or during treatment is given.\n \n   happens even though treatment has been given to try to prevent it. When this happens, you may need more or different medicines to help prevent further nausea and vomiting.\n \n  is when you’re getting medicines to prevent or control nausea and vomiting, but the drugs are not working. Your nausea and vomiting have become refractory (no longer respond) to the medicines you’re getting to prevent it. This means you may need more or different medicines to stop the nausea and/or vomiting. Refractory vomiting may happen after a few or even after several chemo treatments.\n                \n  Nausea and vomiting due to radiation therapy\n \n  Nausea and vomiting can be caused by radiation therapy based on:\n \n   The risk is greatest when the brain is treated, or the area of the body being treated includes a large part of the upper abdomen (belly) – mainly the small intestine (or small bowel) and/or the liver.\n \n  Total body irradiation (used in stem cell transplants) is linked to a high risk of nausea and vomiting if treatment is not given to prevent it. Patients may also get high doses of chemo to prepare for transplant, which further raises the chance of nausea and vomiting.\n \n   The bigger the dose of radiation given, the higher the risk for nausea and vomiting.\n \n   People who get one large dose of radiation have a greater chance of nausea and vomiting than those who get radiation that is spread out over smaller doses.\n \n  When radiation is given along with chemo, the anti-emetic treatment used is based on the nausea and vomiting risk of the chemo drugs given.\n"

        "text": "Medicines Used to Treat Nausea and Vomiting\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n \n \n  \nMany drugs or combination of drugs are available to help prevent and control vomiting. These may also control nausea.\n \n  Your body has several different pathways that trigger nausea and vomiting. Anti-nausea and vomiting drugs (sometimes called anti-emetics) have been developed to target and block these pathways. Some of these drugs target the vomiting center in the brain, while others work as rescue therapy if the initial nausea medicine doesn’t work. Based on this knowledge, and the treatment’s potential to cause nausea and vomiting, your doctor will recommend certain anti-nausea and vomiting medicines. You might have to try a few different drugs to find the ones that work best for you.\n \n  Types of anti-nausea and vomiting drugs\n \n   \n   Anti-emetic drugs are grouped by how they work in the body on different types of nausea and vomiting. It's important to remember that the groups of drugs work differently. One drug might not work as well for you as it does for someone else, depending on the type of nausea and vomiting you might have.\n \n   Serotonin (5-HT3) antagonists block the effects of serotonin, a substance that commonly triggers nausea and vomiting. These drugs are effective at controlling acute nausea and vomiting and are usually given before chemo and then for a few days afterward. (Examples: Ondansetron, Granisetron, Dolasetron, Palonosetron)\n \n   NK-1 receptor antagonists block the effects of the NK-1 receptor, a receptor that is a part of the vomiting reflex. These drugs help with delayed nausea and vomiting and are sometimes used to help with acute nausea and vomiting. They’re often given with other anti-nausea medicines. (Examples: Aprepitant, Rolapitant, Fosaprepitant)\n \n   Steroids are often given with other anti-emetic drugs to better prevent nausea and vomiting. They might be given before or after treatment. Sometimes steroids are not used for nausea and vomiting because of their side effects that might affect other health problems a patient has. (Example: Dexamethasone)\n \n   Dopamine antagonists target dopamine to help prevent this substance from binding to areas in the brain that trigger nausea and vomiting. Many times these drugs are given when nausea and vomiting is not well controlled by other drugs. (Examples: Prochlorperazine, Metoclopramide)\n \n   Benzodiazepines, sometimes called anti-anxiety drugs can help reduce nausea and vomiting by reducing anxiety and helping the person feel more calm and relaxed. These drugs may be more helpful with patients who experience anticipatory nausea and vomiting and are often used in combination with other anti-nausea drugs. (Examples: Lorazepam, Alprazolam)\n \n   Cannabinoids contain the active ingredient in marijuana. These drugs may be used to treat nausea and vomiting from chemo when the usual anti-emetic drugs don’t work. They also may be used to stimulate appetite. Talk to your doctor about any side effects you might experience while using cannabinoids. (Example: Dronabinol, Nabilone)\n \n   Olanzapine is a newer drug used to treat nausea and vomiting. It has been shown to be helpful in reducing breakthrough and delayed nausea and vomiting. It's often an option for people getting high doses of chemo as part of a bone marrow or stem cell transplant. In studies, when used in combination with other anti-nausea and vomiting drugs, nausea was reported to be better controlled. It can make you sleepy, so talk to your doctor about the side effects you might have while using olanzapine. \n \n   Combination anti-nausea medicines include more than one type of anti-nausea drug in one dose. For example, you can get a combination of a serotonin (5-HT3) antagonist with a NK-1 receptor antagonist. This combination is meant to help with both acute and delayed nausea and vomiting.\n \n  \n \n  The drug names given above are only examples. This is not a complete list of the drugs in each group.\n \n  Cost of anti-nausea and vomiting drugs\n \n  Many of these drugs can be expensive and you might need pre-approval from your health insurance before they will be covered. Others are available as generic drugs and cost a lot less than the name brands. Don’t be afraid to ask your cancer care team about the cost of these drugs, what your options are, and what you might have to pay out of pocket. It's important to think about how many pills you may need to get you through your treatment. Be sure you talk to your insurance company about how many pills are covered for each prescription, and let your doctor know if you think you might not have enough to get you through until your next appointment.\n \n  How are anti-nausea and vomiting medicines given?\n \n  There are many ways to take anti-nausea and vomiting medicines. For instance, you may be able to take them:\n \n   \n   Through an IV (intravenously)\n \n   By mouth as a pill or liquid you swallow\n \n   As a tablet that dissolves under your tongue\n \n   As a suppository\n \n   Through a patch that sticks to your skin\n \n  \n \n  Your doctor will consider the following things when deciding the best way to give your anti-emetics:\n \n   \n   How likely it is that the cancer treatment will cause nausea and vomiting\n \n   How bad your nausea and/or vomiting is\n \n   The easiest way for you to take the medicine\n \n   What you prefer\n \n   How quickly the drug will start working\n \n   Your medical insurance coverage (many of these drugs are very expensive, especially in IV form) \n \n  \n \n  If the drugs used at first don’t work, your doctor can switch you to another drug or add a new drug. Another option is to give the drugs a different way (by a different route). Taking pills by mouth is often the best, easiest, and cheapest way to prevent nausea and vomiting. But if you’re already vomiting, or you can’t swallow and keep things down, the medicine might need to be given another way.\n \n  Let your doctor know if you are still having problems despite treatment. Don’t let nausea and vomiting make you feel bad and keep you from getting the nutrition your body needs during treatment. There’s no reason for you to have uncontrolled nausea and vomiting. There are many drugs that can be used to prevent and treat these side effects.\n \n  Treating nausea and vomiting caused by medicines used to treat cancer\n \n  The specific anti-emetic given and how often you take it is based on how likely the chemo or other drug is expected to cause nausea and vomiting. It’s easier to prevent nausea and vomiting than it is to stop it once it starts. No one drug can prevent or control treatment-related nausea and vomiting 100% of the time. This is because treatments act on the body in different ways and each person responds to chemo and to anti-nausea and vomiting drugs differently.\n \n  To choose the best treatment plan for you, the doctor will:\n \n   \n   Consider how likely your treatment is to cause nausea and vomiting\n \n   Look at current research and guidelines that tell the doctor what anti-nausea medicines work best for the treatment you're receiving\n \n   Select medicines based on whether the treatment for cancer is known to affect the vomiting center in the brain\n \n   Ask about your history of nausea and vomiting\n \n   Ask how well any anti-nausea medicines have worked for you before\n \n   Consider side effects of the anti-nausea medicines\n \n   Prescribe the lowest effective dose of the anti-nausea medicine before treatment is given\n \n   Make changes as needed to help keep you from having nausea and vomiting\n \n  \n \n  Anti-nausea and vomiting medicines are often given on a regular schedule around the clock. Your doctor might encourage you to take them on a schedule even if you don't have any nausea or vomiting. Sometimes, you may take the medicine on an \"as needed\" schedule. This means you take the medicine at the first sign of nausea to keep it from getting worse. Ask your cancer care team how you should take these drugs.\n \n   \n   Preventive medication should start before the treatment is given.\n \n   Medication should continue for as long as the cancer treatment is likely to cause vomiting, which may be different for different people based on the type of chemo drug given.\n \n  \n \n  Each time you start a new cycle of chemo, be sure to tell your cancer team what did and didn’t work the last time.\n \n  Treating nausea and vomiting caused by radiation therapy\n \n  If your radiation treatment is likely to cause nausea and vomiting, your doctor will probably give you medicines to help prevent it each day before you get radiation. Anti-nausea and vomiting medicines may be given by mouth or into a vein, or both.\n \n  To choose the best treatment plan, the doctor will:\n \n   \n   Consider how likely the radiation is to cause nausea and vomiting\n \n   Ask about your history of nausea and vomiting\n \n   Ask how well any anti-nausea medicines have worked for you before\n \n   Consider side effects of the anti-nausea medicines\n \n   Prescribe the lowest effective dose of the anti-nausea medicine before radiation therapy is given\n \n   Make drug changes as needed to help keep you from having nausea and vomiting\n \n  \n \n  Anti-nausea and vomiting medicines are often given on a regular schedule around the clock. your doctor may encourage you to take them on a schedule even if you don’t have any nausea or vomiting.

        "text": "Managing Nausea and Vomiting at Home\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n \n   \n  \n                                                    \n   \n   Managing nausea and vomiting at home\n \n  \n \n  Frequent vomiting can be dangerous because it can lead to dehydration. It can also lead to inhaling food or liquids, which can cause choking and other problems.\n \n  Be sure to tell your cancer care team if you have nausea or are vomiting because there are medicines that can help. These medicines should be taken on a regular schedule, or as needed, as prescribed by your doctor. And if a certain drug doesn’t work, your cancer care team may be able to recommend another one. It may take a few tries to find the medicines that work best for you. Talk with your cancer care team about what's causing your nausea and vomiting and what you can do about it.\n \n  What to look for\n \n   \n   Changes in eating habits\n \n   Foul mouth odor\n \n   Yellow or green foul-smelling fluids on bedclothes\n \n   Feeling queasy or having an upset stomach\n \n   Increased saliva, clamminess, and sweating that may come before vomiting\n \n  \n \n  What the patient can do\n \n  For nausea\n \n   \n   Eat the foods you like and those that sound good to you. For example, some people develop a dislike for red meat and meat broths during treatment. In that case, try other protein sources, such as fish, chicken, beans, and nuts.\n \n   If the nausea only happens between meals, keep something in your stomach. Eat frequent, small snacks throughout the day. Snack ideas include smoothies, trail mix, and fruit.\n \n   Do not skip meals or snacks. If your stomach is empty, your nausea might be worse.\n \n   On chemotherapy treatment days, eat a small meal or snack before treatment.\n \n   Try to avoid eating your favorite foods when you have nausea. If you eat foods you like when you are nauseated, you could find them unappealing when treatment is over because you associated them with feeling sick.\n \n   Sip liquids slowly throughout the day. You may find it easier to tolerate cold and clear liquids (Clear liquids are those you can see through, such as ginger ale, apple juice, broth, tea, etc.)\n \n   Also try popsicles or gelatin. Suck on hard candy with pleasant smells, such as lemon drops or mints, to help get rid of bad tastes. (Don’t eat tart candies if you have mouth sores.)\n \n   Eat bland foods, such as dry toast and crackers.\n \n   Eat food cold or at room temperature to decrease its smell and taste. \n \n   Avoid fatty, fried, spicy, or very sweet foods.\n \n   Try small amounts of foods high in calories that are easy to eat (such as pudding, ice cream, sherbets, yogurt, and milkshakes) several times a day. \n \n   Use butter, oils, syrups, sauces, and milk in foods to raise calories. \n \n   Avoid low-fat foods unless fats upset your stomach or cause other problems.\n \n   Tart or sour foods may be easier to keep down (unless you have mouth sores).\n \n   Try to rest quietly while sitting upright for at least an hour after each meal.\n \n   Distract yourself with soft music, a favorite TV program, or the company of others.\n \n   Tell your cancer team about the nausea, because there are many drugs that can help it.\n \n   Take your anti-nausea medicine at the first signs of nausea to help prevent vomiting.\n \n   While waiting for your nausea medicine to work, relax and take slow, deep breaths.\n \n   Try some non-drug treatments for nausea and vomiting\n \n  \n \n  Complementary or alternative (non-drug) treatments for nausea and vomiting\n \n   \n   Anti-nausea and vomiting drugs (anti-emetics) are the main treatments for nausea and vomiting, but some non-drug treatments can also be used. These involve using your mind and body with the help of a qualified therapist.\n \n   Non-drug treatments may be used alone for mild nausea, and are often helpful for anticipatory nausea and vomiting. These methods can be used with anti-nausea and vomiting medicines for a person whose cancer treatment is likely to cause nausea and vomiting. If you’d like to try one or more of these methods, ask a member of your cancer care team if the methods are safe for you and to refer you to a therapist trained in these techniques.\n \n   These methods try to decrease nausea and vomiting by:\n \n    \n    Helping you feel relaxed\n \n    Distracting you from what’s going on\n \n    Helping you feel in control\n \n    Making you feel less helpless\n \n   \n \n   Below are some non-drug methods that have helped some people. Most of them have few or no side effects.  Ask your cancer care team what non-drug treatments they may have available and which ones they can recommend.\n \n   Hypnosis\n \n   Hypnosis can be used to make behavior changes to control nausea and vomiting. It creates a state of intense attention, willingness, and readiness to accept an idea. It is done by a trained specialist.\n \n   Relaxation techniques\n \n   Relaxation techniques such as meditation (focusing the mind), breathing exercises, or progressive muscle relaxation (tensing and relaxing the muscles) can help decrease nausea and vomiting.\n \n   Biofeedback\n \n   Biofeedback helps people reach a state of relaxation. It uses monitoring devices to help people gain conscious control over physical processes that are usually controlled automatically. Using biofeedback, a person learns to control a certain physical response of the body, such as nausea and vomiting. This is done by tuning in to the moment-to-moment body changes that are linked to the physical response. For example, biofeedback can be used to prevent skin temperature changes, such as those that often happen before nausea and vomiting starts. Biofeedback alone has not been found to work as well as for nausea and vomiting as the combination of biofeedback and progressive muscle relaxation.\n \n   Guided imagery\n \n   Guided imagery lets people mentally remove themselves from the treatment center and imagine that they are in a place that’s relaxing for them. The place can be a vacation spot, a room at home, or some other safe or pleasant place. While trying to imagine what they usually feel, hear, see, and taste in the pleasant place, some people can mentally block the nausea and vomiting.\n \n   Systematic desensitization\n \n   Systematic desensitization helps people learn how to imagine an anxiety-producing situation (such as nausea and vomiting) and reduce the anxiety related to the situation. In most cases, what a person can imagine without anxiety, he or she can then experience in the real world without anxiety.\n \n   Acupuncture or acupressure\n \n   Acupuncture is a traditional Chinese technique in which very thin needles are put into the skin. There are a number of different acupuncture techniques, including some that use pressure rather than needles (acupressure). Acupuncture or acupressure can help with nausea.\n \n   Music therapy\n \n   Specially trained health professionals use music to help promote healing.. Music therapists may use different methods with each person, depending on that person’s needs and abilities. There’s some evidence that, when used with standard treatment, music therapy can help to reduce nausea and vomiting due to chemo.\n \n  \n \n  What to eat or not eat on days that you have nausea*\n \n  \n \n  *Adapted from The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics; 2013\n \n  For vomiting\n \n   \n   If you are in bed, lie on your side so that you won’t inhale the vomit.\n \n   Ask that medicines be prescribed in the form that would be easiest for you to tolerate, such as dissolving tablets or suppositories, if possible. To prevent vomiting, take the medicine at the first hint of nausea.\n \n   Wait for the vomiting to stop before eating or drinking anything. After vomiting stops, start taking in small amounts of clear liquids slowly and increase as tolerated.\n \n   Sit upright after vomiting.\n \n   Try liquids in the form of ice chips or frozen juice chips, which can be slowly dissolved in your mouth.\n \n  \n \n  What caregivers can do\n \n   \n   When the patient feels nauseated, offer to make meals or ask others to make meals to reduce bothersome food odors. Use kitchen vent fans to reduce smells.\n \n   Cover or remove foods with strong or unpleasant smells.\n \n   Use plastic forks and spoons rather than metal ones, which may cause a bitter taste..\n \n   Ask about medicines to help prevent vomiting.\n \n   Watch the patient for dizziness, weakness, or confusion.\n \n   Try to help the patient avoid constipation and dehydration by encouraging them to sip on clear liquids slowly throughout the day. Either of these can make nausea worse.\n \n  \n \n  Call the cancer care team if the patient\n \n   \n   Might have inhaled some of the vomited material\n \n   Is vomiting over a period of days,\n    \n \n   Vomits blood or material that looks like coffee grounds\n \n   Cannot take in more than 4 cups of liquid or ice chips in a day or hasn’t eaten for more than 2 days\n \n   Can’t take medicines\n \n   Becomes weak, dizzy, or confused\n \n   Loses 2 or more pounds in 1 to 2 days (This means they are losing water quickly and might be getting dehydrated.)\n \n   Has dark yellow urine and doesn’t urinate as often or as much\n"

        "text": "What Is Peripheral Neuropathy?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n \n \n  \nPeripheral neuropathy is a set of symptoms caused by damage to the nerves that are outside the brain and spinal cord.  These distant nerves are called . They carry sensations (a feeling in different parts of your body) to the brain and control the movement of our arms and legs. They also control the bladder and bowel. \n \n  If you have peripheral neuropathy, you may notice some of these sensations in your hands or feet:\n \n   \n   Tingling (or a “pins and needles” feeling)\n \n   Burning or warm feeling\n \n   Numbness\n \n   Weakness\n \n   Discomfort or pain\n \n   Less ability to feel hot and cold\n \n   Cramps (in your feet)\n \n  \n \n \n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n \n \n  \nWhat causes peripheral neuropathy?\n \n  Some of the chemotherapy and other drugs used to treat cancer can damage peripheral nerves. When this happens it is called . This can be a disabling side effect of cancer treatment. \n \n  CIPN can cause severe pain and can affect your ability to do things like walk, write, button your shirt, or pick up coins. CIPN can last for weeks, months, or even years after treatment is done. If it gets very bad, it can cause more serious problems like changes in your heart rate and blood pressure, dangerous falls, trouble breathing, paralysis, or organ failure. \n \n  Peripheral neuropathy can be caused by other things besides chemotherapy; such as:\n \n   \n   Other cancer treatments, like surgery or radiation\n \n   Tumors pressing on nerves\n \n   Infections that affect the nerves\n \n   Spinal cord injuries\n \n   Diabetes\n \n   Alcohol abuse\n \n   Shingles\n \n   Low vitamin B levels\n \n   Some autoimmune disorders\n \n   HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) infection\n \n   Poor circulation (peripheral vascular disease)\n \n  \n \n  It’s very important to know what’s causing peripheral neuropathy so that the right treatment can be given. The focus here will be on peripheral neuropathy that’s a side effect of chemo – CIPN.\n \n  \n \n  Certain chemo drugs are more likely to cause CIPN. Some of the more common ones include:\n \n   \n   Platinum drugs like cisplatin, carboplatin, and oxaliplatin\n \n   Taxanes, including paclitaxel (Taxol), docetaxel (Taxotere), and cabazitaxel (Jevtana)\n \n   Plant alkaloids, such as vinblastine, vincristine, vinorelbine, and etoposide (VP-16)\n \n   Immunomodulating drugs (IMiDs), like thalidomide (Thalomid), lenalidomide (Revlimid), and pomalidomide (Pomalyst)\n \n   Proteasome inhibitors, such as bortezomib (Velcade), carfilzomib (Kyprolis), and ixazomib (Ninlaro)\n \n  \n \n  If you’re not sure if a chemo drug you’re getting might cause CIPN, ask your cancer care team. \n"

        "text": "Managing Peripheral Neuropathy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n \n \n  \nThere is no sure way to prevent chemo-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN), but there are things you can do to manage your symptoms.  During treatment,  your cancer care team will ask you about your symptoms and watch you to see if the CIPN is getting worse. Your team may need to delay your treatment, use smaller doses of the chemo drugs, or stop treatment with the drug that is causing the CIPN until your symptoms get better. These actions must be started right away to prevent long-term damage that won’t get better.\n \n  Can CIPN be treated?\n \n  Treatment can often help ease some of the symptoms of CIPN. Sometimes these symptoms go away a short time after treatment is done. But sometimes they last much longer and need long-term treatment. Severe CIPN may never go away.\n \n  Treatment is mostly given to relieve the pain that can come with CIPN. Some of the drugs used include:\n \n   \n    for a short time until a long-term treatment plan is in place\n \n    that can be put right on the painful area (for example, lidocaine patches or capsaicin cream)\n \n   , often in smaller doses than are used to treat depression\n \n   , which are used to help many types of nerve pain\n \n   , for when pain is severe\n \n  \n \n  Researchers are looking at which drugs work best to relieve this kind of pain. It may take more than one try to find out what works best for you.\n \n  Other treatments that can be tried to ease nerve pain and its effects on your life include:\n \n   \n   Electrical nerve stimulation\n \n   Occupational therapy\n \n   Physical therapy\n \n   Relaxation therapy\n \n   Guided imagery\n \n   Distraction\n \n   Acupuncture\n \n   Biofeedback\n \n  \n  \n  What can I do to deal with CIPN?\n \n  There are some things you can do to better manage the symptoms of CIPN, such as:\n \n   \n   Talk to your doctor or nurse about the problems you are having in daily life. They might be able to suggest ways to make you feel better or function better.\n \n   If you are taking pain medicines, use them as your doctor prescribes them. Most pain medicines work best if they are taken before the pain gets bad. See Cancer Pain to  learn more about pain, how to talk about it, and how to manage it.\n \n   Avoid things that seem to make your CIPN worse, such as hot or cold temperatures, or snug clothes or shoes.\n \n   Give yourself extra time to do things. Ask friends for help with tasks you find hard to do.\n \n   Don’t drink alcohol. It can cause nerve damage on its own, and might make CIPN worse.\n \n   If you have diabetes, control your blood sugar. High blood sugar levels can damage nerves. \n \n   Talk to your doctor or nurse about whether it is safe for your to exercise. A physical therapist can make suggestions for what might be most helpful to you. \n \n   If constipation is a problem, follow your doctor’s recommendations about laxatives and exercise. Drink plenty of water and eat fruits, vegetables, and whole grains to get enough fiber.\n \n   If the neuropathy is in your feet, sit down as much as possible, even while brushing your teeth or cooking.\n \n   If your neuropathy is permanent, your doctor may refer you to an occupational therapist (OT). They are experts who help people lead more normal lives despite physical limits. \n \n  \n \n  What should I do to avoid injury?\n \n  When your sense of feeling is affected by CIPN, you might be more likely to injure yourself by accident. Here are some things you can do to stay safe:\n \n   \n   If you have neuropathy in your hands, be very careful when using knives, scissors, box cutters, and other sharp objects. Use them only when you can give your full attention to your task.\n \n   Protect your hands by wearing gloves when you clean, work outdoors, or do repairs.\n  \n   Take care of your feet. Look at them once a day to see if you have any injuries or open sores.\n \n   Always wear shoes that cover your whole foot when walking, even at home. Talk to your doctor about shoes or special inserts that can help protect your feet.\n \n   Be sure that you have ways to support yourself if you have problems with stumbling while walking. Hand rails in hallways and bathrooms may help you keep your balance. A walker or cane can give you extra support.\n \n   Use night lights or flashlights when getting up in the dark.\n \n   Protect yourself from heat injuries. Set hot water heaters between 105° to 120°F to reduce scalding risk while washing your hands. Use oven gloves and hot pads when handling hot dishes, racks, or pans. Check bath water with a thermometer.\n \n   Keep your hands and feet warm and well covered in cold weather. For example, consider keeping a pair of gloves in your car. Avoid extreme temperatures.\n    \n  \n \n  What questions should I ask about CIPN?\n \n  Here are some questions you might want to ask your health care team:\n \n   \n   Is the chemo I’m getting likely to cause CIPN?\n \n   Am I at high risk for CIPN?\n \n   What symptoms do I need to watch for and report to you?\n \n   Have you treated CIPN in other patients? How? Did it work?\n \n   What can I do to manage my CIPN?\n \n   If my CIPN gets bad and is very painful, will it change my treatment plan?\n \n   Is it likely that my CIPN will get better or go away after treatment is over?\n \n  \n \n  Talk to your  cancer care team\n \n  It’s important to work closely with your doctor or nurse to manage peripheral neuropathy caused by chemotherapy. Talk to your doctor about any changes in how you feel, and any trouble you have walking or holding things. Tell the doctor how your symptoms affect the things you do every day.\n  \n  If you get medicines for CIPN, be sure to tell your doctor if the drugs are helping and if new problems start up. You might also want to talk with your doctor about whether you can get into a clinical trial to help deal with your CIPN.\n \n  If you are concerned about how future treatment might affect your quality of life, talk with your doctor about what’s most important to you. Remember that only you can decide whether you want to get, or keep getting, a certain treatment.\n"

Cancer and chemotherapy can damage your immune system, reducing your numbers of infection-fighting white blood cells and making it harder for your body to fight infections.\nAn infection can also lead to sepsis,\n the body’s extreme response to an infection. It is a life-threatening medical emergency.\nHaving cancer can make you more likely to get severely ill from COVID-19. Treatments for many types of cancer can weaken your body’s ability to fight off disease. Having a history of cancer may increase your risk.\nWhat Is an Infection?\nYou get an infection when germs enter your body and multiply, causing illness, organ and tissue damage, or disease. Bacteria and viruses cause infections.\nYou can get bacteria\n from the air, water, soil, or food during the course of your medical treatment. Most bacteria come from your own body. Common bacterial infections include pneumonia, urinary tract infections, and ear infections.\nViruses\n are passed from one person to another. Common viral infections include the common cold, herpes, and the flu.\nHow Does Chemotherapy Increase My Risk for Getting an Infection?\n1. Chemotherapy\nChemotherapy drugs treat cancer by killing the fastest-growing cells in the body—both cancer cells and good cells.\n2. Neutropenia\nWhite blood cells\n are good cells that help your body fight infections. Chemotherapy kills many of these cells. This is a side effect called neutropenia.\n3. Infection\nGerms enter your body. With fewer white blood cells, your body can’t kill the germs as well as it could before you started chemotherapy. So you’re more likely to get sick.\nWhat Should I Do If I Think I Have an Infection?\nCall your doctor right away, even if this happens in the middle of the night. This is considered an emergency. Don’t wait until morning. Keep your doctor’s phone numbers with you at all times. Make sure you know what number to call during your doctor’s office hours, as well as after hours.\nWhat Can I Do to Protect Myself from an Infection?\nWatch Out for Fever\nTake your temperature any time you feel warm, flushed, chilled, or not well. Call your doctor right away if you have a temperature of 100.4ºF (38ºC) or higher.\nClean Your Hands\nMany diseases are spread by not cleaning your hands, which is especially dangerous when you’re getting chemotherapy treatment. Wash your hands often.\nKnow the Signs and Symptoms of Infection\nInfection during chemotherapy can lead to hospitalization or death. Call your doctor right away if you notice any of the signs and symptoms of an infection.\nTalk to Your Doctor About Neutropenia\nYour doctor or nurse will let you know exactly when your white blood cell count is likely to be at its lowest. You should carefully watch for signs and symptoms of infection during this time.\n"

These cells are the body’s main defense against infection. Neutropenia is common after receiving chemotherapy and increases your risk for infections.\nWhy Does Chemotherapy Cause Neutropenia?\nThese cancer-fighting drugs work by killing fast-growing cells in the body—both good and bad. These drugs kill cancer cells as well as healthy white blood cells.\nHow Do I Know if I Have Neutropenia?\nYour doctor or nurse will tell you. Because neutropenia is common after receiving chemotherapy, your doctor may draw some blood to look for neutropenia.\nWhen Will I Be Most Likely to Have Neutropenia?\nNeutropenia often occurs between 7 and 12 days after you receive chemotherapy. This period can be different depending upon the chemotherapy you get. Your doctor or nurse will let you know exactly when your white blood cell count is likely to be at its lowest. You should carefully watch for signs and symptoms of infection during this time.\nHow Can I Prevent Neutropenia?\nThere is not much you can do to prevent neutropenia from occurring, but you can decrease your risk for getting an infection while your white blood cell count is low.\n"

State and local authorities, as well as health officials, continue to adjust their recommendations as the number of COVID-19 cases changes in different parts of the country and as new information becomes available.\n \n  \n \n  COVID-19 is the name of the illness caused by a new type of coronavirus that has led to a worldwide outbreak, which was first reported in China in December 2019. The name of this coronavirus strain is “SARS-CoV-2.”\n \n  Coronaviruses are a family of viruses that can cause common colds, as well as more serious respiratory diseases such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS).\n \n  COVID-19 variants\n \n  Over time, viruses such as the one that causes COVID-19 can change (mutate), which can result in . These variants might have slightly different traits than the original virus – for example, some of them seem to spread more easily and quickly. Several variants of the virus that causes COVID-19 have appeared around the world in recent months, and some of these have now been found in the United States.\n \n  Much is still unknown about these variants, including how well they can be detected with current COVID-19 tests, how effective the current COVID vaccines will be against them, and how well current COVID treatments will work against them. For the latest information, visit the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website.\n \n  \n \n  According to the CDC, the most common way for the virus to spread is during  with another person:\n \n   \n   When somebody who is infected coughs, sneezes, talks, raises their voice (such as when shouting or singing), or even breathes, they can create respiratory droplets that contain the virus.\n \n   These droplets might reach the mouths, eyes, or noses of people who are in close contact (within about 6 feet), which could lead to an infection.\n \n  \n \n  But there are other ways the virus might spread as well:\n \n   \n   Some small droplets and particles can linger in the air for minutes to hours. They might travel farther than 6 feet or might remain in the air even after the infected person has left, and they might be able to cause new infections, especially in enclosed spaces that aren’t well ventilated. This form of spread is known as .\n \n   Respiratory droplets can also land on , which people might then touch. This could potentially lead to an infection if a person then touches their mouth, nose, or eyes.\n \n  \n \n  Because of this, it’s important that everyone\n follow the CDC’s and other health departments’ recommendations on how to protect yourself and others.\n \n  \n \n  According to the CDC, there are things you can do to help lower the risk of being infected, as well as infecting others.\n \n  \n \n   \n   Wear a mask that covers your mouth and nose when around others. (See below for more details.)\n \n   Avoid close contact – being within 6 feet (about 2 arms' length) of people who don't live in your household, and any people who are sick.\n \n   Get a COVID-19 vaccine as soon as it is available to you. And stay up to date with your COVID-19 vaccines, which might include an additional dose and/or a booster.  \n \n   Avoid crowded indoor spaces.\n \n   Avoid indoor places with poor air circulation that do not allow as much fresh outdoor air as possible.\n \n   Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash, or cough or sneeze into your elbow. Then wash your hands right away.\n \n   Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds because it’s one of the best ways to kill germs on your hands and prevent the spread of germs to others. If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol.\n \n   Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands, because if you picked up the virus, you could infect yourself by allowing the virus to enter your body. \n \n   Follow CDC recommendations for isolation, quarantine, and testing if you are exposed to COVID-19 or have symptoms of COVID-19.\n \n   Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces daily using a regular household cleaning spray or wipe. Always read the directions of the products closely to make sure you are using them correctly. Cleaning and disinfecting products should not be used directly on skin, taken by mouth, or inhaled into the lungs. Disinfecting products, like bleach, should not be used on food.\n \n  \n  \n  If you are a cancer patient, survivor, or caregiver, talk to your cancer care team about whether there are any additional precautions you should take. \n \n  People who need medical care might be encouraged to take advantage of telehealth services, if they are available, and \"see\" their doctors without going in person for an office visit. Medicare has temporarily expanded its coverage of telehealth services. Some health insurance providers are doing the same.\n \n  It’s important to keep in mind that some people who are infected with the virus might not have symptoms, but they could still spread the virus to others. Because of this, it’s important that everyone\n follow the CDC’s recommendations on how to protect yourself and others.\n \n  Should I wear a mask?\n \n  The CDC recommends that in certain situations people should wear a mask that completely covers the nose and mouth to protect yourself and others from COVID-19 and to reduce the spread of the disease. \n \n  Since not all masks provide the same protection, the CDC has information on the types of masks available (for example, cloth, surgical, KN95, and N95) and how to wear them so they work the best they can. The CDC recommends that you wear the most protective mask you can, that fits you well, and that you will wear regularly. Keep in mind that wearing any type of mask is better than not wearing a mask at all.\n \n  It is best to check with your local authorities to see if your area has specific guidelines about wearing a mask in public. People with weakened immune systems should check with their healthcare team about if and when they should wear a mask (see below).\n \n  It’s important to understand that wearing a mask is not a substitute for social distancing. It’s still very important to stay at least 6 feet away from others who don't live in your household, even while wearing a mask, and to continue to wash your hands frequently.  \n \n  Are there different recommendations for cancer patients and caregivers?\n \n  The CDC  has guidance for  people who immunocompromised or taking medicines that can weaken their immune system, such as people with cancer. People being treated for cancer, especially with treatments like chemotherapy or stem cell (bone marrow) transplants that can weaken the immune system, may not be fully protected even if they are fully vaccinated. Even after vaccination, they may need to continue taking precautions such as wearing masks. \n \n  What about eye protection?\n \n  The CDC recommends the use of eye protection (goggles or face shields) for health care workers (doctors, nurses, technicians, dentists, and others) in certain settings. However, face shields by themselves are not recommended for the general public in place of a mask, as it’s not yet clear how effective they are.\n \n  The CDC has recommendations for certain things people and their households can do to help prevent COVID-19 depending on the level of COVID-19 spread in their community. This guidance is updated regularly, so check the CDC website for details. \n \n  \n \n  Vaccines that can help protect against COVID-19 are  available in the US. The CDC recommends the vaccines for everyone 5 years of age and older.\n \n  To learn more, see COVID-19 Vaccines in People With Cancer.\n \n  \n \n  \n \n  The most common symptoms of COVID-19, which may appear 2-14 days after being infected, are:\n \n   \n   Fever\n \n   Cough\n \n   Shortness of breath\n \n   Chills\n \n   Muscle aches and pains\n \n   Sore throat\n \n   New loss of smell or taste\n \n   Feeling very tired\n \n   Headache\n \n   Diarrhea\n \n   Nausea or vomiting\n \n   Runny nose\n \n  \n \n  Contact your doctor or local health department if you have any of these symptoms.\n \n  If you or the person you’re caring for has any of the following  of COVID-19, get medical attention right away:\n \n   \n   Trouble breathing\n \n   Constant pain or heaviness in the chest\n \n   New confusion or being hard to wake up\n \n   Bluish lips or face\n \n  \n \n  Some people with COVID-19 might have signs or symptoms of blood clots such as bluish toes (also referred to as “COVID toes”), swelling of the lower leg, chest pain, shortness of breath, or stroke symptoms (slurred speech, weakness or numbness of an arm or leg). The reasons for this are being still studied, but it's important to tell your doctor right away if you are having any of these symptoms.\n \n  COVID-19 generally does not seem to affect children as much as it does adults, but children can become infected, and some can even develop serious illness. Just like adults, children who have certain medical conditions are at a higher risk for these severe symptoms. A rare but serious syndrome that is linked to COVID-19 in children, called multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), has also been reported. Children with this syndrome can have symptoms such as a fever and rash similar to Kawasaki disease, as well as severe body inflammation. The CDC is keeping track of this syndrome to learn more about it and its relationship to the coronavirus infection.\n \n  It’s important to know that some people who are infected with the virus might not have symptoms, but they could still spread the virus to others. Because of this, it’s important that everyone\n follow the CDC’s recommendations on how to protect yourself and others.\n \n  \n \n  Some cancer patients might be at increased risk of serious infection in general because their immune systems can be weakened by cancer and its treatments. Most people who were treated for cancer in the past (especially if it was years ago) are likely to have normal immune function, but each person is different.  \n \n  Doctors are still learning about the possible risks of COVID-19 infection for people with cancer. Taking steps to limit exposure to the virus that causes COVID-19 is especially important for cancer patients, who might be at higher risk for serious illness if they get infected. This can be particularly true for people with blood cancers (such as leukemia or lymphoma) and those getting chemotherapy, long courses of corticosteroids, certain types of immunotherapy, or a stem cell or bone marrow transplant, because their immune systems can be severely weakened by the cancer itself or the treatment.\n \n  The pandemic has also affected the way many people get medical care, including people with cancer. Depending on the COVID-19 situation where you live, this may mean a delay in getting some types of cancer tests, or even treatments. Some people may need to reschedule appointments.\n \n  Cancer care teams are doing the best they can to deliver care to their patients. However, in many cases, it isn’t life as usual. It's important to keep in contact with your cancer care team to determine the best course of action for you. This may involve talking to your care team virtually (online or over the phone) and not physically going to the clinic.\n \n  Many clinics and infusion centers have made changes to allow you to come in safely for in-person visits as well as treatment. These might include screening for COVID-19 symptoms ahead of your visit, proper spacing of waiting room and infusion chairs, spacing out appointments to limit the number of people in the waiting room at one time, requiring people to wear a mask, and cleaning all surfaces frequently. It’s important to know who to call to reach your cancer care team to find out how to proceed.\n \n  You might have other options for getting your cancer medicines as well. For example, some people might be able to switch to oral medicines instead having to go in for infusions. For some people, another option might be to get infusions of their cancer medicines at home. However, there are safety issues to consider with home infusions, and it’s important to discuss these with your health care team before deciding on getting treatment this way.\n \n  The issues with getting cancer treatment and testing during this pandemic are slowly improving, but there will likely continue to be changes in the way cancer patients receive their care.\n \n  In the meantime, doctors need to learn more about cancer patients and COVID-19. Registries such as the COVID-19 and Cancer Consortium and studies such as the NCI COVID-19 in Cancer Patients Study are actively collecting data. Early studies from registries in the US and around the world have looked at outcomes for cancer patients who develop COVID-19 with symptoms, as well as if certain anti-cancer treatments change these outcomes. These initial study results are helpful, but it is very important to gather more data and analyze it over a longer time to better understand the effects of COVID-19 on current and former cancer patients. Contact your doctor if you are interested in participating in a registry or study.\n \n  Why can’t someone come with me for my doctor visits/treatments?\n \n  While some medical visits are now being done online or over the phone, things like physical exams, lab or imaging tests, and treatments (such as surgery, radiation therapy, or chemotherapy) still need to be done in person. \n \n  Many doctor’s offices, treatment centers, hospitals, and other facilities have ‘no visitor’ or 'only one visitor' policies in place, meaning that only the person being treated and/or one visitor is allowed to enter. This is to help protect the people in these places, many of whom might be vulnerable if they were to be infected with COVID-19. \n \n  At the same time, these policies can create a great deal of anxiety for both cancer patients and their loved ones. The caregivers who usually accompany patients are an important source of support for them, and they can often be invaluable in both giving information to the health care team and in helping to make sure that patients understand what’s being told to them.\n \n  While it might not be possible for caregivers to attend all of these in-person visits right now, there are still some ways to stay involved and informed about what’s going on:\n \n   \n   Ask if the patient can have the caregiver on a phone call during the visit so the caregiver can listen to the conversation and ask/answer questions.\n \n   Ask for a family consult with someone from the health care team after the visit so the caregiver knows what was discussed.\n \n   Ask if the center might allow more frequent telehealth visits so the caregiver can be present.\n \n   If you have an online portal, ask if you can submit questions and get answers there.\n \n   Ask if you can get a copy of the progress note that the healthcare provider writes up after each visit – either a physical copy on the day of the visit or in some other format (for example, via an online portal).\n \n  \n \n  Does health insurance cover COVID-19 testing and care?\n \n  You may or may not have out-of-pocket costs if you get tested for COVID-19 or if you need medicines or other care to treat it. You’ll need to check with your health insurance company about coverage. Here are some tips and resources to get you started:\n \n   \n   Call the toll-free number on the back of your insurance card\n \n   Read about Medicare coverage of coronavirus-related needs\n \n   See Medicaid’s frequently asked questions about COVID-19\n \n   Learn about coronavirus and your Marketplace health plan coverage﻿\n \n  \n \n  \n \n  At the start of the pandemic, many places put elective medical procedures, including cancer screening, on hold to conserve medical resources and reduce the risk of spreading COVID-19 in healthcare settings. Since then, many states and other authorities have re-opened businesses and eased restrictions. Likewise, many health systems are scheduling cancer screening tests and exams again. So, what should you do if you’re due (or overdue) for a cancer screening?\n \n  Decisions about getting screened depend on many factors, and they may not be the same for every person. Some important things to consider include your risk of getting a certain type of cancer, how long it’s been since you were last screened for it, how common COVID-19 is in your community, and your age and overall health.\n \n  Talk to your health care provider about the risks and benefits for you of being screened now, and whether or not it might make sense to postpone it at this time.  Getting back on track with cancer screening should still be a priority.\n \n  For more information, see Cancer Screening During the COVID-19 Pandemic.\n \n \n\n\n\n    \nScreening tests are different from tests your doctor might order if you have symptoms that could be from cancer. \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n \n \n  \n \n  According to the CDC, the risk for severe illness from COVID-19 increases with age, with older adults at highest risk. People with certain medical conditions are also at increased risk. This includes:\n \n   \n   Having cancer\n \n   Having a weakened immune system after getting an organ transplant, after a stem cell or bone marrow transplant, or after getting certain treatments like chemotherapy\n \n   Being overweight or obese (having a body mass index [BMI] of 25 or higher)\n \n   Smoking (now or in the past)\n \n  \n \n  The CDC says that people with a history of cancer may be at increased risk of getting severely ill from COVID-19, so it is a good idea to talk with your doctor about your situation.\n \n \n\n\n\n    \n\n    \n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n \n \n  \nCan I get COVID-19 from a blood transfusion?\n \n  According to the American Red Cross, there is no evidence that the virus that causes COVID-19 can be transmitted through a blood transfusion.\n \n  Donating\n blood\n is still possible for those who are healthy and feel well, and it’s greatly needed, according to the Red Cross. The COVID-19 outbreak and resulting social distancing has led to canceled blood drives and dramatic blood shortages in many parts of the country. And people with cancer often need blood during their treatment.\n \n  The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has information on donating blood and other things you can do to help during this pandemic.\n \n  Can I get tested to see if I’m infected (or was infected in the past)?\n \n  Tests for the virus that causes COVID-19can be done on samples taken by swabbing inside the nose or throat or on saliva (spit) samples. The testing field is changing rapidly, as the FDA continues to allow new tests onto the market. But not everyone needs to be tested for COVID-19.\n \n  The CDC has issued guidance on who should consider being tested. This is based on things like:\n \n   \n   If the person is having symptoms\n \n   If the person has had close contact with someone known to have COVID-19\n \n   If the person is likely to be exposed to the virus (as is the case for many health care workers)\n \n   If the person is in the hospital or is at higher risk for complications if they’re infected\n \n  \n \n  If you are having symptoms that might be from COVID-19 or have been exposed to someone who has it, call your doctor or health department to discuss whether you need to be tested.\n \n  Testing is now available in many areas without the need for a doctor’s order. If you feel you should be tested, your state or local health department may have information on testing places available in your area.\n \n  The results of your test might change what you need to do (such as isolating yourself from other people if the test is positive), but they might not change your treatment. For example, if you have mild (or no) symptoms, you may not need treatment even if the test is positive.\n \n  If you do get tested and are negative for COVID-19, it doesn’t guarantee that you are not infected, as testing is not always 100% accurate. It also doesn't mean that you can’t be infected at a later date. It’s still important to do what you can to lower your risk of infection, such as getting a COVID vaccine and taking other appropriate precautions.\n \n  Are at-home tests an option?\n \n  For some of the COVID-19 tests in use, the samples need to be obtained by a health care professional. But for other tests the samples can be collected at home:\n \n   \n   Most at-home tests use swabs to collect samples from inside the nose\n \n   Some tests use samples of saliva\n \n  \n \n  With some at-home tests, once the samples are collected, they need to be shipped to a lab for the actual testing, so the results won’t be available right away. There are  other at-home tests that do not need to be sent to a lab, and that give results within a short amount of time.\n \n  Certain at-home tests  require a doctor’s order before they can be done, but other tests can be done without the need for a doctor’s order.\n \n  What about antibody (serology) tests?\n \n  These tests look at a person’s blood for specific antibodies (immune system proteins) that would show that the person has been exposed and had an immune response to the virus. Antibody tests do not look for the virus itself, so they can’t be used to tell if someone is currently infected. They can only tell if a person has been exposed to the virus at some point.\n \n  It's not clear how useful the results of antibody testing are at this time. While many different antibody tests are now being used, the results from some of them might not be as accurate as others. And even with an accurate test result, experts aren’t yet sure if having a positive test means that you can’t be infected again.\n \n  The FDA has more information about the different types of COVID-19 tests now in use.\n    \n  Do I still need to take precautions if I get the COVID-19 vaccine?\n \n  The COVID-19 vaccines are still being studied, as there are things we don’t yet know about them. For example, researchers are still trying to determine how long the COVID-19 vaccines will help protect against the virus, as well as how well it works against different virus variants. And while the vaccines can clearly lower the risk of getting serious disease from COVID, it’s not yet clear how well they can prevent the spread of the virus to others.\n \n  The CDC has recommendations for certain things people and their households can do to help prevent COVID-19 depending on the level of COVID-19 spread in their community. This guidance is updated regularly, so check the CDC website for details. \n \n  \n \n  Can other medicines lower the risk of COVID-19 infection?\n \n  COVID-19 vaccines are the main medicines used to lower the risk of getting COVID-19 (and of having more serious disease if you do get it). But some other medicines can also be used to lower the risk of infection in certain situations.\n \n  In people who have not\n been exposed to the virus recently\n \n  For certain people who are less likely to get adequate protection from COVID-19 vaccines, a combination of the monoclonal antibodies , given as an injection into a muscle once every 6 months, can help lower the risk of infection. (This is known as pre-exposure prevention\n.)\n \n  These medicines can be used in people who do not\n have COVID-19 and who have not\n recently been exposed to the virus, AND who:\n \n   \n   Aren’t likely to have an adequate immune response to the COVID-19 vaccine because they have a weakened immune system (which includes many people being treated for cancer), OR\n \n   Can’t get the vaccine because of a previous severe reaction to the vaccine (or parts of it)\n \n  \n \n  It’s important to note that \n \n  Are there medicines to treat COVID-19?\n \n  Not everyone infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 needs to be treated. But if treatment is needed, several different drugs (or combinations of drugs) might be used, depending on how sick a person is, how old they are, and other factors. These treatments can be used in most people, including people with cancer.\n \n  Some of these drugs work by targeting the virus that causes COVID-19. Examples include:\n \n   \n   (Veklury)\n \n    and  (Paxlovid)\n \n   \n \n   \n \n   \n \n  \n \n  Some drugs work by helping to reduce inflammation in the body. (Inflammation can lead to some of the more severe symptoms of COVID-19.) Examples of such drugs include:\n \n   \n    \n \n    \n \n   Corticosteroids, such as  and\n \n  \n \n  People who have fully recovered from COVID-19 have antibodies against the virus in the liquid part of their blood (known as plasma). Treatment with this plasma (known as ) might be helpful in some people with COVID-19.\n \n  Many other drugs that might help treat COVID-19 or its symptoms are now being studied as well.\n \n  What about chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine?\n \n  The drugs chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are already used to treat malaria and some other conditions. Some doctors have tried them in certain patients with COVID-19. The FDA has cautioned against the use of these drugs to treat COVID-19 unless a person is taking part in a clinical trial. According to the FDA, “Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine have not been shown to be safe and effective for treating or preventing COVID-19.” Clinical trials are still needed for doctors to truly know if these drugs are safe and effective.\n \n  What about ivermectin?\n \n  The drug ivermectin is approved to treat parasitic worms and some other conditions in humans. It is also approved for use in animals to prevent heartworm or to treat certain parasites. Some doctors have tried ivermectin in certain patients with COVID-19. The FDA has cautioned against the use of these drugs to prevent or treat COVID-19 unless a person is taking part in a clinical trial. Additional testing is needed to know if this drug might be helpful in preventing or treating COVID-19.\n \n  What about dietary supplements or over-the-counter treatments?\n \n  Despite claims now appearing online and in social media, it’s important to know that .\n \n  The World Health Organization (WHO) has a list of mythbusters to debunk some claims you may have heard about how the new coronavirus may be transmitted or treated.  \n \n  \n \n   \n   \n \n   \n \n   \n \n  \n \n  This article was first published on March 3, 2020.\n",

The person you care for may be at high risk of infection with COVID-19 because cancer and cancer treatments often weaken their immune systems. You may be at higher risk yourself if you are older or have an underlying health condition. Staying healthy protects you and the person you’re caring for. That means taking extra steps to keep both of you from getting sick.\n \n  People with certain cancer types, including lymphomas, multiple myeloma, and most types of leukemia are at the highest risk for infections. These cancers cause changes that make the immune system unable to work as well as it should. People who have recently had surgery for cancer and those in active treatment who are getting chemotherapy, radiation, targeted therapy, or immunotherapy may also be at higher risk. Some treatments, such as stem cell or bone marrow transplants, involve giving high doses of drugs that may cause long-term weakening of the immune system. But most people who have finished treatment (especially if it was years ago) probably have an immune system that’s back to normal.\n \n  If you aren’t sure whether the person you’re caring for has a weakened immune system, ask their health care team. It’s also a good idea to find out if their insurance covers telehealth, and if the cancer care team is using it to help communicate with patients during this time.\n \n  Have a back-up plan ready in case you, the person you’re caring for, or someone else in the household gets sick.\n \n  \n \n  Stay home as much as you can and have contact with as few people as possible. Stay in touch with the cancer care team and be ready for possible changes to treatment plans. Read our list of questions you may want to ask.\n \n  Take these extra steps to protect yourself and the person you’re caring for:\n \n   \n   Don’t travel. Follow your state and local rules about traveling and leaving your home. Avoid crowds and public places. Go out as little as possible. Ask the cancer care team if medical appointments should be kept or postponed. If you do need to go out, take hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol to clean your hands and then wash with soap and water when you get home.\n \n   If the doctor wants to keep treatment appointments, only one caregiver should go along. No one who is sick or has any symptoms should go to a cancer treatment center. Be prepared to be screened at the door or to have to wait outside because some centers may not allow caregivers in the building at all.\n \n   At home, use household disinfectants regularly on things that you touch a lot, such as door handles, cell phones, remote controls, computer keyboards, and any items that are used by other people.\n \n   If you have to go out, wash your hands with soap and water as soon as you get home, wipe down the items you’ve brought home (including your purse, wallet, and cell phone), and wash your hands again after wiping them down.\n \n   When at home, wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially before eating and before touching your face.\n \n   Wash your hands after using the bathroom, blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing.\n \n   Wash your hands after touching animals, collecting trash, or taking out garbage.\n \n   Wash your hands after touching items used by others.\n \n   Read more about more ways to help someone with cancer lower their risk of infection.\n \n  \n \n  \n \n  If you find out you’ve been exposed to coronavirus, notify your doctor and the cancer care team of the person you’re caring for right away. They will help guide you in your next steps.\n \n  \n \n  If you or the person you’re caring for has symptoms of COVID-19, call your doctor and the cancer care team and let them help you. The most common symptoms that need medical attention are fever, cough, and feeling short of breath. Some people may also have diarrhea or nausea before these other symptoms occur.\n \n  Some symptoms are more serious and mean you need to get help right away. If you notice the following symptoms in either yourself or the person you’re caring for and feel you need to go to an emergency room, call the doctor or 911 first. This way you, the person you’re caring for, the first responders, the medical staff, and other people in the emergency room can be protected. Serious signs and symptoms of COVID-19 include:\n \n   \n   Trouble breathing or shortness of breath\n \n   Constant pain or pressure in the chest\n \n   New confusion or being hard to wake\n \n   Bluish lips or face\n \n  \n \n  If anyone in the household gets sick with mild symptoms and the doctor tells them to stay at home, follow guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n \n   \n   Have the person stay in one room, away from other people, as much as possible.\n \n   Have the person use a separate bathroom and bedroom if possible, and avoid sharing personal household items including dishes, utensils, towels, and bedding.\n \n   If facemasks are available, have the person wear a facemask when they are around others.\n \n   Have the person wash their hands often or use hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol if they cannot get up to use soap and water.\n \n   Wash your hands often, especially after you’ve been with the sick person, and avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth.\n \n   Regularly clean all surfaces that are touched often, such as counters, tabletops, phones, and doorknobs.\n \n   Wash laundry thoroughly. Wear disposable gloves while doing laundry if you have them. After you take the gloves off, wash your hands.\n \n  \n \n  \n \n  Almost everyone has some risk of getting sick from the coronavirus. But staying informed and having healthy habits can help. This goes for you as well as the person you’re caring for.\n \n   \n   Stay informed about local, state, and federal information to help guide your daily activities.\n \n   Get plenty of sleep. The CDC recommends adults get between 7 and 9 hours each night.\n \n   Eat a healthy diet, with lots of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Eat less refined grains, red meat (beef, pork, and lamb) and processed meat (hot dogs, ham, bacon, sausage, and some deli meats), desserts, high-fat dairy products, and fried foods.\n \n   Drink more water, less sugary drinks, and less alcohol.\n \n   Keep getting your regular amount of exercise. Add a little more if you can.\n \n   Stay in touch with family and friends.\n \n   Take care of your emotional health.\n \n  \n \n  COVID-19 and Cancer ECHO for Cancer Caregivers \n \n  Hear from a panel of experts about how to care for your loved ones during the pandemic.",

        "text": "Facts About Cancer Pain\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n \n  \n  \nHaving cancer does not always mean having pain. But if you do have pain, you can work with your health care team to make sure a pain relief plan is part of your care. There are many different kinds of medicines, different ways to take the medicines, and non-drug methods that can help relieve it.\n \n  How might pain affect people with cancer?\n \n  Any type of pain, not just cancer pain, can affect all parts of a person's life. Some days it may be better or worse than others. \n \n  If you have pain, you might not be able to do your job well or take part in other day-to-day activities. You may have trouble sleeping and eating. You might be irritable with the people you love. It’s easy to get frustrated, sad, and even angry when you’re in pain. Family and friends don’t always understand how you’re feeling, and you may feel very alone. This is not unusual, so it's important to talk about your pain with your health care team so they can help.\n  \n  Can cancer pain be relieved? \n \n  You should never accept pain as a normal part of having cancer. It's important to remember that all pain can be treated. Cancer pain may not always be completely relieved, but your doctor can work with you to control and lessen it as much as possible. Knowing how to report and describe it can help your health care team know how to treat it.\n             \n  What causes pain in people with cancer?\n \n  The cancer itself often causes pain. The amount of pain you have depends on different factors, including the type of cancer, its stage (extent), other health problems you may have, and your pain threshold \n(tolerance for pain). People with advanced cancer are more likely to have pain.\n \n  Cancer surgery, treatments, or tests can also cause pain. You may also have pain that has nothing to do with the cancer or its treatment. Like anyone, you can get headaches, muscle strains, and other aches or pains.\n \n  Pain from the cancer itself\n \n  Pain from the cancer can be caused by a tumor pressing on nerves, bones, or organs.\n \n  When a tumor spreads to the spine, it can press on the nerves of the spinal cord. This is called spinal cord compression. The first symptom of spinal cord compression is usually back and/or neck pain, and sometimes it is severe. Pain, numbness, or weakness may also happen in an arm or leg. Coughing, sneezing, or other movements often make the pain worse. If you have this kind of pain, it is considered an emergency and you should get help right away.\n \n  Spinal cord compression must be treated right away to keep you from losing control of your bladder or bowel or being paralyzed.  If you’re treated for the compression soon after the pain begins, you can usually avoid serious outcomes. Treatment for spinal cord compression usually involves radiation therapy to the area where the tumor is pressing on the spine and steroids \nto shrink the tumor. Or you may be able to have surgery to remove a tumor that’s pressing on the spine, which may then be followed by radiation.\n \n   This type of pain can happen when cancer starts in or spreads to the bones. Treatment may be aimed at controlling the cancer, or it can focus on protecting the affected bones. External radiation may be used to treat the weakened bone. Sometimes a radioactive medicine is given that settles in the affected areas of bone to help make them stronger. Bisphosphonates are  drugs that can help make weakened bones stronger and help keep the bones from breaking. These are examples of treatments that are aimed at stopping the cause of the bone pain. You may still need pain medicines, but sometimes these treatments themselves, can greatly reduce your pain.\n \n  Bone pain can also happen as a side effect of medicines known as growth factor drugs or colony-stimulating factors (CSFs). These drugs may be given to help prevent white blood cell (WBC) counts from dropping after treatment. CSF drugs help the body produce more WBCs which are made in the bone marrow. Because the bone marrow activity is higher with these drugs, bone pain may occur. \n \n  Pain from cancer surgery, treatments, and tests\n \n  Surgery is often part of the treatment for cancers that grow as solid tumors. Depending on the kind of surgery you have, some amount of pain is usually expected and can last from a few days to weeks. Talk to your doctor about pain medicines you may need after surgery so you won’t be in pain when your surgery is over. You may need stronger pain medicine at first after surgery, but after a few days or so you should be able to control it with less strong medicines.\n \n  Phantom pain is a longer-lasting effect of surgery, beyond the usual surgical pain. If you’ve had an arm, leg, or even a breast removed, you may still feel pain or other unusual or unpleasant feelings that seem to be coming from the absent (phantom) body part. Doctors are not sure why this happens, \nbut \nphantom pain \nis real; it’s not “all in your head.”\n \n  No single pain relief method controls phantom pain in all patients all the time. Many methods have been used to treat this type of pain, including pain medicine, physical therapy, antidepressant \nmedicines, and transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation (TENS). If you’re having phantom pain, ask your cancer care team what can be done.\n     \n  Some treatment side effects cause pain. Pain can even make some people  stop treatment if it’s not managed. Talk to your cancer care team about any changes you notice or any pain you have.\n \n  Here are some examples of pain caused by cancer treatment:\n \n   \n   Peripheral neuropathy (PN). This refers to pain, burning, tingling, numbness, weakness, clumsiness, trouble walking, or unusual sensations in the hands, arms,  legs, and/or feet. Peripheral neuropathy is due to nerve damage caused by certain types of chemotherapy, vitamin deficiencies, a tumor pressing on a nerve,  or other health problems such as diabetes and infections. When caused by chemotherapy, it's sometimes called . Some non-cancer medications can also have peripheral neuropathy as a possible side effect. Be sure to talk to your health care team about other health problems and medications you are taking, and be sure to tell your doctor right away if you notice  any symptoms that you think may be from peripheral neuropathy.\n \n   Mouth sores (stomatitis or mucositis). Chemotherapy can cause sores and pain in the mouth and throat. The pain can cause people to have trouble eating, drinking, and even talking.\n \n   Radiation mucositisand other radiation injuries. Pain from external radiation depends on the part of the body that’s treated. Radiation can cause skin burns, mucositis (mouth sores), and scarring – all of which can cause pain. The throat, intestine, and bladder are also prone to radiation injury, and you may have pain if these areas are treated.\n \n  \n \n  Some tests used to diagnose cancer and see how well treatment is working can be painful. When you are scheduling a procedure or test, ask your health care team if pain is expected. If you need such a procedure, concern about pain should not keep you from having it done. Any pain you have during and after the procedure can be treated. You may be told that the pain from the procedure can’t be avoided or that it won’t last long. Even so, you should ask for pain medicine if you need it.\n"

        "text": "Acute, Chronic, and Breakthrough Pain\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n \n \n  \nPeople with cancer who have pain may notice that their pain changes throughout the day, and that it may be different from day to day. Keeping track of your pain and its symptoms, and reporting them, will help your health care team understand what you're experiencing, and then figure out the type of pain it is. The type of pain you have determines the type of drug or treatment you will need to best relieve it.\n \n  Even though you have a diagnosis of cancer, your doctor or health care team may not call your pain  \"cancer pain.\" And, it's possible some or all of the pain you're feeling is caused by something other than cancer. You may hear them refer to your pain as , , , or .\n \n  Acute pain\n \n  Acute pain is usually severe, comes on quickly, and lasts a fairly short time. It’s most often a sign that the body has been injured in some way. This pain generally goes away as the injury heals.\n \n  Chronic or persistent pain\n \n  Chronic or persistent pain can come on quickly or slowly, and can range from mild to severe. Unlike acute pain, chronic or persistent pain lasts for long periods of time. Pain is usually considered chronic if it lasts longer than 3 months. It can disrupt your life and normal activities if it’s not well treated. Chronic pain doesn’t go away unless its underlying cause is treated, but it can usually be lessened or controlled by taking pain medicines on a regular schedule. Sometimes this is referred to as taking pain medicines \"around the clock.\"\n \n  Breakthrough pain\n \n  Breakthrough pain is a flare of pain that might happen even though you are taking pain medicine regularly for chronic pain. It “breaks through” the pain relief you get from the regular pain medicine. It usually cannot be predicted.\n \n  As a rule, breakthrough pain comes on quickly, lasts as long as an hour, and feels much like chronic pain except that it’s worse, and it can vary in intensity. It can happen many times a day, even when your chronic pain is controlled by the regular pain medicine you are taking around the clock.\n \n  Breakthrough pain often has the same cause as chronic pain. It may be the cancer itself or it may be related to cancer treatment. Some people have breakthrough pain during a certain activity, like walking or dressing. For others, it happens unexpectedly without any clear cause.\n \n  It’s very important to manage this type of pain. Breakthrough pain is not controlled by regular doses of pain medicines. It is usually treated with an additional dose of pain medicine or a different kind of medicine.\n"

Shots may be needed depending on the type of medicine given, but there are many other ways you can take pain medicine.\n \n    The medicine is taken by mouth, either by being swallowed or dissolved and absorbed on the tongue or inside the cheek. Oral pain medicine is given as a liquid, pill, capsule, or transmucosal form  in a lozenge, “sucker,” or spray absorbed directly through the tissues of the mouth.\n \n   \n \n    \n   \n \n   : A clear, sticky patch placed on the skin. It slowly – but constantly – releases medicine through the skin for 2 to 3 days.\n \n   : Medicine that is inserted into in the rectum, dissolves, and then is absorbed by the body.\n \n   There are several ways medicines can be injected.\n \n    \n    Subcutaneous (SC) injection – medicine is put just under the skin using a short, small needle.\n \n    Intramuscular (IM) injection - medicine is put deeper into a muscle (usually in the arm, leg, or buttocks) using a medium length needle. This method is rarely used for pain medicines if other options are available.\n \n    Intravenous (IV) injection – medicine goes right into a vein through a needle, port, or catheter.\n \n    Intrathecal and epidural injections – medicine is put into the fluid around the spinal cord (intrathecal) or into the space around the spinal cord (epidural).\n \n   \n \n   : The pump is connected to a small tube going into your body. The medicine in the pump goes into a vein, just under the skin, or into the area around the spine.\n \n    When you need pain relief, you press a button to get a pre-set dose of pain medicine through a computerized pump. (The pump carefully controls how much you can get at a time, so you can’t take too much.) With this method, you have control over the amount of pain medicine you take."

        "text": "Opioids for Cancer Pain\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n \n  \n  \nOpioids (narcotics) are used with or without non-opioids to treat moderate to severe pain. They are often a necessary part of a pain relief plan for cancer patients. These medicines are much like natural substances (called endorphins) made by the body to control pain. They were once made from the opium poppy, but today many are man-made in a lab. \n \n  Safe use of opioids\n \n  Doctors and cancer care teams may prescribe opioids for patients having increasing or severe pain from their cancer or their treatment. Opioids should be prescribed and used with great care for several reasons:\n \n   \n   Some pain medicines may interfere with other medications. \n \n   Pain medicines may affect people differently. Because of this, some cannot be given to older adults, young children, or certain people being treated for other medical conditions. \n \n   The growing concern of what is being called an \"opioid epidemic\" in the U.S. It's important to remember that opioids can be safely prescribed and used to help control cancer pain.\n \n  \n \n  Your cancer care team will understand any safety concerns you or your loved ones may have about opioids. They also know it's their responsibility to treat your cancer-related pain in the most effective way. Sometimes opioids are needed as part of a pain relief plan.\n \n  Because of safety concerns, you will always need a signed,  (not faxed, emailed, or called in) for opioid pain medicines. For this reason, it’s important that only  prescribe your pain medicines. If you have 2 or more doctors, be sure that one does not prescribe opioids for you without talking to the others about it.\n \n  Your doctor may ask you and your loved ones questions before prescribing opioids to be sure they will not be used in wrong or unsafe ways. They may ask you who you live with, if children are in the home, how your medications are stored, and other questions. Doctors will also watch you carefully and adjust the doses of pain medicine so you don’t take too much. While taking opioids, you may need to have regular urine or blood tests to check drug levels.  \n \n  If you drink alcohol or take tranquilizers, sleeping pills, antidepressants, antihistamines, or any other medicines that make you sleepy, your doctor will need to know how much and how often you do this. Taking opioids (even small doses) while drinking alcohol or taking tranquilizers may cause problems and can lead to overdoses and symptoms like weakness, trouble breathing, confusion, anxiety, or more severe drowsiness or dizziness.\n \n  If you are taking opioids to help relieve your cancer pain, here are some important tips.\n \n   \n   Store your medications securely, such as in a locked box.\n \n   Only take the drug as instructed.\n \n   Don’t share your medication with anyone.\n \n  \n \n  Common opioids used for cancer pain\n \n  Here are some of the opioids used in cancer care. Some of the more common brand names are in parentheses.\n \n   \n   Tramadol (Ultram)\n \n   Hydromorphone (Dilaudid)\n \n   Methadone (Dolophine, Methadose)\n \n   Morphine (Apokyn, Avinza, Kadian, MS-Contin, and others)\n \n   Oxycodone (OxyContin, OxyIR, Roxicodone)\n \n   Hydrocodone\n \n   Oxymorphone (Opana)\n \n   Fentanyl (Actiq, Duragesic, Fentora, Lazanda, Subsys, and others)\n \n   Tapentadol (Nucynta)\n \n  \n \n  An “ER” behind the name of any opioid drug names stands for “extended release,” and is a sign that the drug is taken on a regular schedule to treat chronic pain. An “IR” stands for “immediate release” and means that the drug will work quickly and for only a short time. These rapid-onset opioids are used to treat breakthroughpain. \nExamples of these types of drugs are fast-acting oral morphine; fentanyl in a lozenge, “sucker,” or under-the-tongue spray. (These forms of fentanyl are absorbed from your mouth – they are not swallowed.)\n \n  A short-acting opioid, which relieves breakthrough pain quickly, is often used with a long-acting opioid.\n \n  Many times the same opioid drug is used to treat both chronic and breakthrough pain. But, it might be prescribed in 2 different pill forms, one that has only the opioid in it and one that combines an opioid with a non-opioid. Be sure you know what you’re taking because it's important not to mix them up!\n  \n   \n  \n \n  Common opioid and acetaminophen or NSAID drug combinations\n \n  See Non-opioids and Other Drugs to Treat Cancer Pain for more on acetaminophen and NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) like aspirin and ibuprofen.\n  \n  Oxycodone\n \n  Oxycodone may be added to aspirin, acetaminophen, or ibuprofen. For instance:\n \n   \n   Percodan has aspirin in it\n \n   Percocet, Roxicet, Roxilox, Oxycet, and Tylox all have acetaminophen\n \n   Combunox has ibuprofen\n \n  \n \n  Hydrocodone\n \n  Hydrocodone may be added to acetaminophen or ibuprofen. For instance:\n \n   \n   Vicodin, Zydone, Norco, and Lortab all contain acetaminophen\n \n   Vicoprofen and Reprexain have ibuprofen\n \n  \n \n  If you’re taking a combination pain medicine, be sure you know what drugs are in each pill.\n \n  How to get proper pain reliefwith opioids\n \n  If you feel the drug is not helping to control your pain, talk with your doctor. When a medicine doesn’t give you the pain relief you need, your doctor may prescribe a higher dose or tell you to take it more often. When your cancer care team is working closely with you, doses of strong opioids can be raised safely to ease severe pain. Don’t decide to take more pain medicine on your own. If changing the dose doesn’t work, your doctor may prescribe a different drug or add a new drug to the one you’re taking.\n \n  If your pain relief isn’t lasting long enough, ask your doctor about  that come in pills and patches. These can control your pain for a longer period of time.\n \n  If your pain is controlled most of the time, but you sometimes have , your doctor may prescribe a fast-acting medicine or immediate-release opioid that will give you faster pain relief right when it’s needed.\n    \n  Opioid tolerance\n \n  You might find that over time you need larger doses of pain medicine. This may be because the pain has increased or you have developed a drug tolerance. Drug tolerance occurs when your body gets used to the opioid you’re taking, and it takes more medicine to relieve the pain as well as it once did. Many people do not develop a tolerance to opioids. But if you do develop drug tolerance, usually small increases in the dose or a change in the kind of medicine will help relieve the pain.\n \n  Having to increase your dose of opioids to relieve increasing pain or to overcome drug tolerance  mean that you are addicted.\n \n  Side effects of opioids\n \n  Not everyone has side effects from opioids. The most common side effects are usually sleepiness, constipation, nausea, and vomiting. Some people might also have dizziness, itching, mental effects (such as nightmares, confusion, and hallucinations), slow or shallow breathing, or trouble urinating.\n \n  Many side effects from opioid pain medicine can be prevented. Some of the mild ones such as nausea, itching, or drowsiness, often go away without treatment after a few days, as your body adjusts to the medicine. Let your doctor or nurse know if you’re having any side effects and ask for help managing them.\n \n  Here are a few of the more common side effects:\n \n  Drowsiness or sleepiness\n \n  When you first start taking them, opioids might make you sleepy, but this usually goes away after a few days. If your pain has kept you from sleeping, you may sleep more for a few days after starting opioids while you “catch up” on your sleep. You also will get less sleepy as your body gets used to the medicine. Call your doctor or nurse if you still feel too sleepy for your normal activities after you’ve been taking the medicine for a week.\n \n  Sometimes it may be unsafe for you to drive a car, or even to walk up and down stairs alone. .\n \n  Here are some ways to handle sleepiness:\n \n   \n    and see if it goes away.\n \n   Check to see if .\n \n   Ask the doctor if you can  more often or an extended-release opioid.\n \n   Ask your doctor what you can do to , if the opioid is not relieving the pain. The pain itself may be tiring you out. In this case, better pain relief may lead to less sleepiness.\n \n   Ask for . It will still relieve your pain but won’t cause drowsiness. If the drowsiness is very bad, you may be taking more medicine than you need. Talk to your doctor about lowering the amount you’re taking.\n \n   Ask your doctor about .\n \n   Ask your doctor if you can  such as caffeine during the day.\n \n    or if it suddenly starts to be a problem after you’ve been taking opioids for a while, .\n \n  \n \n  Constipation\n \n  Opioids cause constipation in most people, but it can often be prevented or controlled. Opioids slow the movement of stool through the intestinal tract, which allows more time for water to be absorbed by the body. The stool then becomes hard. When you start taking opioids, it’s best to take a laxative, stool softener, or other treatment to help keep your stool soft and your bowels moving. For more detailed information on what you can do, see Constipation \n   \n  Nausea and vomiting\n \n  Nausea and vomiting caused by opioids will usually go away after a few days of taking the medicine.  For suggestions on handling this side effect, see Nausea and vomiting.\n \n  Some people think they’re allergic if they have nausea after they take an opioid. Nausea and vomiting alone usually are not allergic reactions. But a rash or itching along with nausea and vomiting may be an allergic reaction. If this happens, stop taking the medicine and call your doctor right away. If you have swelling in your throat, hives (itchy welts on the skin), or trouble breathing, get help right away.\n \n  When you no longer need opioids\n \n  You should not stop taking opioids suddenly. People who need or want to stop taking opioids are usually tapered off the medicine slowly so that their bodies have time to adjust to it. If you stop taking opioids suddenly and develop a flu-like illness, excessive sweating, diarrhea, or any other unusual reaction, tell your doctor or nurse. These symptoms can be treated and tend to go away in a few days or weeks. Again, slowly decreasing your opioid dose over time usually keeps these kinds of symptoms from happening. Check with your doctor about the best way to taper off your pain medicines.\n"

        "text": "Non-opioids and Other Drugs Used to Treat Cancer Pain\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n \n   \n  \nNon-opioids or non-narcotics, like acetaminophenand non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) control mild to moderate pain. Some can be bought without a prescription (over-the-counter). These medicines are stronger pain relievers than most people realize. In many cases, non-opioids are all you’ll need to relieve your pain, especially if you “stay on top of the pain.” Staying on top of the pain means you should take pain relievers regularly, and not wait until your pain level becomes too intense. Waiting too long can make the pain harder to treat. \n \n  Acetaminophen\n \n  Acetaminophen is commonly known as Tylenol. It relieves pain much the same way NSAIDs do, but it doesn’t reduce inflammation as well as NSAIDs do. People rarely have side effects from the usual dose of acetaminophen. But liver and kidney damage may result if you take large doses of this medicine every day for a long time or drink alcohol with the usual dose. Even moderate amounts of alcohol (3 drinks per day) can lead to liver damage in people taking acetaminophen. You also need to be careful about taking other drugs that have added acetaminophen. See the section on Precautions about aspirin, acetaminophen, and ibuprofen in other medicines.\n \n  Your doctor may not want you to take acetaminophen regularly if you’re getting chemotherapy because it can cover up a fever. Your doctor needs to know if you have a fever because it could mean you have an infection, which needs to be treated quickly.\n \n  Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs\n \n  Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) work a lot like aspirin. Either alone or used with other medicines, NSAIDs can help control pain. Before you take any NSAIDs or other non-opioids, ask your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse if it’s safe for you to take it with your other medicines, and how long you can take it. See the chart below for examples of commonly used NSAIDs.\n \n  Precautions about NSAIDs\n \n  Some people have a higher risk of complications related to NSAIDS. In general, NSAIDs should be avoided by people who:\n \n   \n   Are allergic to aspirin or any other NSAIDs\n \n   Are on chemotherapy\n \n   Are taking steroids\n \n   Are taking blood pressure medicines\n \n   Have stomach ulcers or a history of ulcers, gout, or bleeding disorders\n \n   Are taking oral medicine (drugs by mouth) for diabetes or gout\n \n   Have kidney problems\n \n   Will have surgery within a week\n \n   Are taking blood-thinning medicine\n \n   Are taking lithium\n \n  \n \n  If you drink alcohol, be careful taking NSAIDs. It can cause stomach upset and raise the risk of having reflux or even . Smoking may also increase this risk. NSAIDs may also , especially if you take them for a long time.\n \n  \n \n  Precautions about aspirin, acetaminophen, and ibuprofen in other medicines\n \n  Some opioids also contain aspirin or acetaminophen in the same pill. A few also contain ibuprofen. It can be dangerous if you take these drugs without being aware of this.\n \n   \n   If one of your doctors tells you not to take aspirin or ibuprofen, or if you can’t take NSAIDs for some reason, be sure to check your medicine labels carefully.\n \n   If one of your prescription medicines has acetaminophen in it, and you also take over-the-counter acetaminophen for pain, you can get too much without knowing it. Too much acetaminophen can damage your liver.\n \n   If you’re not sure if a medicine contains aspirin, acetaminophen, or ibuprofen, ask a pharmacist.\n \n   If you take any non-prescription medicine for a cold, sinus pain, or menstrual symptoms while you’re taking pain medicines, read the label carefully. Most of these drugs are combination products that contain aspirin, ibuprofen, or acetaminophen. Check with a pharmacist to find out what you can safely take with your pain medicines.\n \n  \n \n  Side effects of acetaminophen and NSAIDS*\n \n  \n \n  * NSAIDs = Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs\n \n  How drugs are named\n \n  A drug may have as many as 3 different names: Brand, generic, and chemical. For example:\n  \n  \n \n  Drug companies give their products brand names, and some products have more than one brand name. You should also know that the same brand name may be used on different drugs, since the name belongs to the company. Read the labels to see what ingredients are in each medicine.\n \n  \n \n  The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approves the generic names by which drugs are usually known. Sometimes medicines can have the same generic name, but are made by different companies. Because the companies may produce the medicines differently, they may differ slightly in the way they’re absorbed by the body. For this reason, your doctor may sometimes prefer that you take a brand-name drug. Generic drugs usually cost less than brand-name ones. Ask your doctor, nurse, or pharmacist if you can use a cheaper generic medicine. Pharmacists are careful to get high-quality generic products, so it’s often possible to substitute a generic.\n \n   N-(4-hydroxyphenyl) acetamide\n \n  Chemical names tend to be long and hard to pronounce, so they are not used often.\n \n  What you need to know about drug names\n \n  Many pain relievers are available under both generic and brand names. Your doctor, nurse, or pharmacist can tell you the generic and common brand names of any medicines you’re taking. It’s always good to know both because you may hear either name when talking about your medicines. Knowing both names can also keep you from getting confused when keeping track of prescriptions and pill bottles. It can also keep you from taking too much of the same medicine if it’s prescribed using 2 different names.\n \n  Drug additives\n \n  Along with the main substance (for example aspirin, acetaminophen, or ibuprofen), some brands contain additives. Common additives include:\n \n   \n    (such as magnesium carbonate or aluminum hydroxide) to decrease stomach upset\n \n    to act as a stimulant and to improve the effect of some pain medicines\n \n    (such as diphenhydramine or pyrilamine) to help you relax or sleep\n \n  \n \n  Medicines with additives can cause side effects you wouldn’t expect from the main drug. For example, antihistamines sometimes cause drowsiness. This may be all right at bedtime, but it could be a problem during the day. Additives tend to increase the cost of non-prescription pain relievers. They can also change the action of other medicines you may be taking or even keep your body from absorbing the other drug. When you start a new drug, even one you can get over the counter, always talk with your doctor or pharmacist about what you’re already taking to see if the combination can cause harmful effects.\n \n  Plain aspirin, acetaminophen, or ibuprofen probably works as well as the same medicines with additives. But if you find that a brand with certain additives is a better pain reliever, ask your doctor, nurse, or pharmacist if the additives are safe for you. Talk with them about any concerns you may have about the drugs contained in your non-prescription pain medicines.\n \n  Other medicines commonly used to help treat cancer pain\n \n  Many different types of medicines can be used along with (or instead of) opioids and non-opioids to help relieve cancer pain. Some of these medicines can help relieve pain or increase the effect of the pain medicine. Others lessen the side effects of pain medicines. These drugs are often started at low doses and increased over time. The table shows the classes and some examples of drugs that are not really pain medicines, but might be used to help you get the best pain relief with as few side effects as possible.\n \n  \n \n \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            Written by\n        \n\n    \n        \n            References\n        \n\n    \n\n    \n        \n    \n            \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n            \n\n            The American Cancer Society medical and editorial content team\nOur team is made up of doctors and oncology certified nurses with deep knowledge of cancer care as well as journalists, editors, and translators with extensive experience in medical writing.\n\n        \n\n    \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n            \n        \n\n    \n        \n    \n            \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n        \n            \n            American Cancer Society.

        "text": "Other Medical Treatments for Cancer Pain\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n \n \n  \n  \n   If your cancer pain isn’t being relieved by drugs or non-medical methods, other types of treatments may be an option.\n \n   Treatments to stop or lessen pain impulses \n \n   Surgery\n \n   Pain can’t be felt if the nerve pathways that carry pain impulses or signals to the brain are interrupted. To block these pathways, a neurosurgeon may cut nerves, usually near the spinal cord. When the nerves that relay pain are cut, pain, pressure, and temperature can no longer be felt – the area becomes numb.\n \n   Only surgeons with special skills, who are also experts in pain management, should do this kind of surgery. These surgeons normally work with other pain specialists to explore other methods of pain control before they cut nerves – this treatment cannot be reversed.\n \n   Nerve block\n \n   A nerve block is a procedure where a local anesthetic (a numbing drug), \noften combined with a steroid, is injected into or around a nerve or into the space around the spinal cord to block pain. After the injection, the nerve is no longer able to relay pain so the pain is relieved for some time. For longer-lasting pain relief, phenol or alcohol can be injected. A nerve block may cause muscle paralysis or a loss of all feeling in the affected area.\n \n   Spinal analgesia\n \n   Low doses of pain medicine may be injected into the fluid around the spine (called ). If this works, a tube and a pump may be used to deliver the pain medicine right into the spinal fluid to control the pain. Morphine is often used for this purpose, and you can still have side effects like itching and constipation. You will need surgery to put the small pump and tube into your body.\n \n   Epidural or intrathecal injections\n \n   Certain kinds of pain may respond to pain medicine that’s injected into the space around the layers of the spine. If this works, a pump can be implanted so that you can get pain medicines right around the nerves. This may cause numbness or weakness of the treated area.\n \n   Neuroablation\n \n   Neuroablation may be helpful for some pain. It uses heat therapy (through radiofrequency or ultrasound) or cold therapy (cryotherapy) to reduce pain. \n \n   Nerve stimulation\n \n   There are different types of nerve stimulation therapies that may be an option for treating certain types of cancer-related pain. Research is continuing on these methods for pain control.\n \n    \n    Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS): Uses low-voltage electric current to the skin at the area of pain with a small, battery-powered machine. \n \n    Spinal cord stimulation: Uses a device to send mild electric currents to block nerves in the spine.\n \n    Peripheral nerve stimulation: Uses small electrodes to send mild electric currents to peripheral nerves, which are located outside the brain and spinal cord. \n \n   \n \n   Treatments to shrink the tumor\n \n   Sometimes, even when treatment can’t cure the cancer, it can shrink the size of a tumor that’s pressing on nerves and organs and causing pain. Cancer treatments like chemo, hormone therapy, or radiation may be used in this way.\n \n   Radioactive injections are sometimes used when the cancer has spread to many places in the bone – the radioactive drug settles in the bones near the cancer to help stop its growth and relieve pain.\n \n   In some cases, other treatments like radiofrequency ablation can be used in certain areas of the body. In this treatment, electrodes are put in near the tumor to heat and destroy the cancer.\n"

        "text": "Non-medical Treatments for Pain\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n \n  \n  \nA few non-medical treatments may be used to treat cancer pain along with pain medicines. This is sometimes called complementary or integrative therapy. Some people may find they can take a lower dose of pain medicine when they also use non-medical treatments, but it's important to talk with your doctor and cancer care team to know if these may be good options for you.\n \n  Health care professionals – social workers, physical therapists, psychologists, nurses, or others – can help you find information and learn if these techniques may be good options to include in your pain relief plan. \n \n  To learn about these techniques and find someone who specializes in them:\n \n   \n   Talk with members of your cancer care team.\n \n   Contact a local palliative care team, hospice organization, \ncancer treatment center, or pain clinic.\n \n   Visit your local bookstores or library.\n \n   Look for pain relief information on reliable websites.\n \n  \n \n  You can also contact the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health to learn more about these techniques.\n \n   Pain may be a sign that the cancer has spread, an infection has started, or that the cancer treatment is causing problems. Or, pain may be happening for a reason not related to cancer. Because of this, you should report any new pain problems to your doctor or nurse before trying to relieve the pain on your own.\n \n  General guidelines\n \n  Here are some general guidelines for using non-medical methods to manage pain:\n \n   \n   Try using a non-medical method along with your regular pain medicines. For instance, you might use a relaxation technique (to lessen tension, reduce anxiety, and manage pain) at the same time you take medicine.\n \n   Know yourself and what you can do. Often when you are rested and alert, you can use a method that demands more attention and energy. When tired, you may need to use a method that requires less effort. For example, try distraction when you’re rested and alert; use hot or cold packs when you’re tired.\n \n   Try different methods to learn which ones work best for you. Be open-minded, and keep a record of what makes you feel better and what doesn’t help.\n \n  \n \n  Common techniques used for cancer pain\n \n  Acupuncture\n \n  In acupuncture, very thin needles are put into the body at certain points and at various depths and angles. Each point is thought to control the feeling of pain in a different part of the body. When the needle is put in, some people feel a slight ache, dull pain, tingling, or electrical sensation for a few seconds. Once the needles are in place, they shouldn’t hurt. The needles are usually left in for 15 to 30 minutes. It doesn’t hurt when the needles are removed. Acupuncture is widely available, but it should only be done by a licensed, certified acupuncturist. You'll need the advice of your doctor and will need to ask your cancer care team where to get acupuncture.\n \n  If you are getting chemotherapy, talk to your doctor before starting acupuncture.\n \n  Biofeedback\n \n  You’ll need the advice of your doctor and the help of a licensed biofeedback technician to learn if this technique is an option for you. Biofeedback is sometimes used to help people learn to relax and cope with pain. This technique is usually used along with other pain-relief methods. Biofeedback uses special machines that give instant feedback on the state of your body. This helps you learn to control certain body functions such as heart rate, blood pressure, and muscle tension. \n \n  Distraction\n \n  Distraction means turning your attention to something other than the pain. People often use this method without realizing it when they watch TV or listen to music to take their minds off a worry.\n \n  Distraction may be used alone to manage mild pain or used with medicine to manage brief bouts of severe pain, such as pain related to procedures. Distraction can be useful while you’re waiting for pain medicine to start working.\n \n  Any activity that you have to focus on can be used for distraction. Distractions can be internal, such as counting, singing to yourself, praying, or repeating statements in your head such as “I can cope.” Or distractions can be external, such as needlework, model building, or painting. Losing yourself in a good book might divert your mind from pain. Watching TV and listening to music are also good distractions. Slow, rhythmic breathing can be used along with distraction to help you relax. Visiting with friends or family is another useful distraction technique.\n \n  You may find it helpful to listen to rather fast music through a headset or earphones. To help keep your attention on the music, tap out the rhythm. This technique doesn’t require much energy, so it may be useful when you’re tired.\n \n  After using some distraction techniques, people have reported feeling tired, irritable, and in more pain. If this happens to you, try different techniques, and use them only when you have mild pain.\n \n  Emotional support and counseling\n \n  If you feel anxious or depressed, your pain may feel worse. Pain also can make you feel worried, depressed, or easily discouraged. Some people feel hopeless or helpless. Others may feel embarrassed, inadequate, angry, frightened, lonely, or frantic. These are all normal feelings.\n \n  Try to talk about your feelings with someone you feel comfortable with – doctors, nurses, social workers, family or friends, a member of the clergy, or other people with cancer. You could also talk to a counselor or a mental health professional. Your cancer care team can help you find a counselor who is specially trained to help people with chronic illnesses.\n \n  You may want to try a support group where people with cancer meet and share their feelings. Support groups can be face-to-face meetings, or you can meet in a group online. For information about support groups in your community and online, ask your cancer care team or call us at 1-800-227-2345. Also, many newspapers carry a special health supplement with information on where to find local support groups.\n \n  Hypnosis\n \n  Hypnosis is a trance-like state of high concentration in which you are awake but calm and still. In this relaxed state, people might become more relaxed and open to suggestion. Hypnosis can be used along with other methods to blunt the awareness of pain, to substitute another feeling for the pain, or to change the feeling to one that’s less painful. You can be hypnotized by a person trained in hypnosis, often a psychologist, psychiatrist, or other mental health therapist. You can also be taught to hypnotize yourself.\n  \n  A trained hypnotherapist can teach people to put themselves in a hypnotic state, make positive suggestions to themselves, and leave the hypnotic state when they’re ready.\n \n  Choose a hypnotherapist who’s licensed in the healing arts or who works under the supervision of someone who is licensed. You'll need the advice of your doctor and help to find a therapist skilled in hypnosis.\n \n  Imagery\n \n  Imagery is using your imagination to create mental pictures or situations. The way imagery relieves pain is not fully understood, although it may be simply a combination of relaxation and distraction. Imagery can be thought of as a deliberate daydream that uses all of your senses – sight, touch, hearing, smell, and taste. Some people believe that imagery is a form of self-hypnosis.\n \n  Certain images may reduce your pain both during imagery and for hours afterward. If you must stay in bed or can’t leave the house, you may find that imagery helps you feel less closed in – you can imagine and revisit your favorite spots in your mind. Imagery can help you relax, relieve boredom, decrease anxiety, and help you sleep.\n \n  Imagery usually works best with your eyes closed. The image can be something like a ball of healing energy moving through your body, or a picture drawn in your mind of yourself as a person without pain. (For example, imagine that you’re cutting the wires that send pain signals from each part of your body to your brain.) Or think of a pleasant, safe, relaxing place or activity that has made you happy. Exploring this place or activity in your mind can help you feel calm.\n \n  Here’s an exercise with the ball of energy.\n \n   \n   Close your eyes. Breathe slowly and feel yourself relax.\n \n   Focus on your breathing. Breathe slowly and comfortably from your abdomen (belly). As you breathe in, say silently and slowly to yourself, “In, 1, 2.” As you breathe out, say, “Out, 1, 2.” Breathe in this slow rhythm for a few minutes.\n \n   Imagine a ball of healing energy forming in your lungs or on your chest. It may be like a white light. It can be vague – it doesn’t have to be clear or vivid. Imagine this ball forming, taking shape.\n \n   When you’re ready, imagine that the air you breathe in blows this healing ball of energy to the area of your pain. Once there, the ball heals and relaxes you.\n \n   When you breathe out, imagine the air blows the ball away from your body. As it goes, the ball takes your pain with it.\n \n   Repeat the last 2 steps each time you breathe in and out.\n \n   You may imagine that the ball gets bigger and bigger as it takes more and more discomfort away from your body.\n \n   To end the imagery, count slowly to 3, breathe in deeply, open your eyes, and say silently to yourself, “I feel alert and relaxed.” Start moving about slowly.\n \n  \n \n  Problems that may occur with imagery are much like the ones that occur with the relaxation techniques.\n \n  Relaxation\n \n  Relaxation helps relieve pain and/or keeps it from getting worse by reducing muscle tension. It can help you fall asleep, give you more energy, make you less tired, reduce anxiety, and help other pain-relief methods work better.\n \n  Relaxation may be done sitting up or lying down. Choose a quiet place whenever possible. Close your eyes. Do not cross your arms and legs because that may cut off circulation and cause numbness or tingling. If you’re lying down, be sure you’re comfortable. Put a small pillow under your neck and under your knees or use a low stool to support your lower legs.\n \n  You can also ask your doctor or nurse to recommend relaxation CDs for you. These recordings provide step-by-step instructions in relaxation techniques.\n \n  \n \n   \n   Open your eyes and stare at an object, or close your eyes and think of a peaceful, calm scene.\n \n   With the palm of your hand, firmly massage near the area of pain in a circular movement. Avoid red, raw, or swollen areas. A family member or friend can do this for you.\n \n   Inhale/tense, exhale/relax.\n \n   Breathe in deeply. At the same time, tense your muscles or a group of muscles. For example, you can squeeze your eyes shut, frown, clench your teeth, make a fist, stiffen your arms and legs, or draw up your arms and legs as tightly as you can.\n \n   Hold your breath and keep your muscles tense for a second or two.\n \n   Let go. Breathe out and let your body go limp.\n \n  \n \n  \n \n   \n   Stare at an object or close your eyes and focus on your breathing or on a peaceful scene.\n \n   Take a slow, deep breath and, as you breathe in, tense your muscles (such as your arms).\n \n   As you breathe out, relax your muscles and feel the tension draining.\n \n   Now stay relaxed and begin breathing slowly and comfortably. Focus on your breathing, taking about 9 to 12 breaths a minute. Breathing too fast or too deeply can cause dizziness or other symptoms.\n \n   To keep a slow, even rhythm as you breathe out, you can say silently to yourself, “In, 1, 2; out, 1, 2.” It may be helpful at first if someone counts out loud for you. If you ever feel out of breath, take a deep breath and then continue the slow breathing. Each time you breathe out, feel yourself relaxing and going limp. If some muscles, such as your shoulder muscles, aren’t relaxed, tense them as you breathe in and relax them as you breathe out. Do this only once or twice for each muscle group.\n \n   Continue slow, rhythmic breathing for a few seconds up to 10 minutes, depending on your need.\n \n   To end your slow, rhythmic breathing, count silently and slowly from 1 to 3. Open your eyes. Say silently to yourself, “I feel alert and relaxed.” Begin moving about slowly.\n \n  \n \n   Some people who have used relaxation for pain relief have noticed some common problems and have made these suggestions.\n \n   \n   Relaxation may be hard to use when you have severe pain. Try quick and easy relaxation methods such as rhythmic massage or breathe in/tense, breathe out/relax. Or you can wait until your pain medicine starts working before you start the relaxation methods.\n \n   Sometimes breathing too deeply for a while can make you feel short of breath. If this happens, take shallow breaths and/or breathe more slowly.\n \n   You may fall asleep. This can be a good thing if you’re ready to go to bed. If you don’t want to fall asleep, sit in a hard chair while doing the relaxation exercise or set a timer or alarm.\n \n  \n \n  If you have trouble using these methods, ask your cancer care team to refer you to someone experienced in relaxation techniques. Do not keep using any technique that increases your pain, makes you feel uneasy, or causes unpleasant effects.\n \n  Skin stimulation\n \n  You'll need the advice of your doctor or help from your cancer care team to know if skin stimulation is a safe option for you. If you’re getting radiation therapy, you shouldn’t put ointments, salves, menthol, or liniments on the treatment area, and you shouldn’t use heat or extreme cold on treated areas. If you’re getting chemotherapy, some techniques for the skin may worsen skin-related or neuropathy side effects.\n \n  In this series of techniques, pressure, warmth, or cold is used on the skin, while the feeling of pain is lessened or blocked. Massage, pressure, vibration, heat, cold, and menthol preparations can also be used to stimulate the skin. These techniques also change the flow of blood to the area that’s stimulated. Sometimes skin stimulation will get rid of pain or lessen pain during the stimulation and for hours after it’s finished.\n \n  Skin stimulation is done either on or near the area of pain. You can also use skin stimulation on the side of the body opposite the pain. For example, you might stimulate the left knee to decrease pain in the right knee.\n  \n  Massage\n \n  Using a slow, steady, circular motion, massage over or near the area of pain with just your bare hand or with any substance that feels good, such as powder, warm oil, or hand lotion. Depending on where your pain is, you may do it yourself or get help from a family member, friend, or a massage therapist. Some people find brushing or stroking lightly feels better than deep massage. Use whatever works best for you.\n \n  If you’re getting radiation therapy, avoid massage in the treatment area as well as in any red, raw, tender, or swollen areas.\n \n  Pressure\n \n  Press on various areas over and near your pain with your entire hand, the heel of your hand, your fingertip or knuckle, the ball of your thumb, or by using one or both hands to encircle your arm or leg. You can test this by applying pressure for about 10 seconds to see if it helps. You can also feel around your pain and outward to see if you can find “trigger points,” small areas under the skin that are very sensitive or that cause more pain. Sometimes gradual pressure on the trigger points helps to relieve pain. Pressure usually works best if it’s applied as firmly as possible without causing more pain. You can use pressure for up to 1 minute. This often will relieve pain for several minutes to hours after the pressure is released.\n \n  Vibration\n \n  Vibration over and near the area of the pain may bring short-term relief. For example, the scalp attachment of a hand-held vibrator often relieves a headache. For low back pain, a long, slender battery-operated vibrator placed at the small of the back may be helpful. You can use a vibrating device such as a small battery-operated vibrator, a hand-held electric vibrator, or a large heat-massage electric pad.\n \n  If you’re getting radiation therapy, avoid vibration in the treatment area. Do not use a vibrator on the stomach or over red, raw, tender, or swollen areas.\n \n  Cold or heat\n \n  Heat often relieves sore muscles. Cold can help lessen the feeling of pain by partly numbing the painful area. You can also switch back and forth between heat and cold for added relief in some cases.\n \n  For cold, try gel packs that are sealed in plastic and stay soft and flexible even when frozen. You can get them at drugstores and medical supply stores. They can be stored in the freezer and reused. You may want to wrap the pack in a towel to make it more comfortable. An ice pack, ice cubes wrapped in a towel, frozen peas, or water frozen in a paper cup also work.\n \n  If you start to shiver when using cold, stop right away. Do not use cold so intense or for so long that the cold itself causes more pain.\n \n   \n   Avoid cold over any area where you are getting radiation treatments and for 6 months after it has ended.\n \n   If you’re getting chemotherapy, check with your doctor before using a cold pack.\n \n   Do not use cold over any area where your circulation or sensation is poor.\n \n   Do not apply cold for more than 5 to 10 minutes at a time.\n \n  \n \n  To use heat for pain relief, a heating pad with a moisture option is handy. You can also try gel packs warmed in hot water; hot water bottles; a hot, moist towel; a regular heating pad; or a hot bath or shower. You might want to try one of the heat patches you can buy at the drugstore. For aching joints, such as elbows and knees, wrap the joint in a lightweight plastic wrap (tape the plastic to itself). This retains body heat and moisture.\n \n  Do not use a heating pad on bare skin.\n \n   \n   Do not fall asleep with the heating pad turned on.\n \n   Be very careful if you’re taking medicines that make you sleepy or if you don’t have much feeling in the area.\n \n   Do not use heat over a new injury because heat can increase bleeding.\n \n   Avoid heat over any area where you’re getting radiation treatments and for 6 months after treatment has ended.\n \n   Do not use heat over any area where your circulation or sensation is poor.\n \n   Do not apply heat for more than 5 to 10 minutes at a time.\n \n  \n \n  Menthol\n \n  Because it can possibly worsen side effects of certain cancer treatments, talk to your doctor or nurse to know if menthol is a good option for you. Many menthol preparations – creams, lotions, or gels – are available for pain relief. When they’re rubbed into the skin, they increase blood circulation to the affected area and produce a warm (or sometimes cool) soothing feeling that lasts for several hours.\n  \n  You should not use menthol when you are getting certain chemotherapy and radiation treatments for cancer that can affect sensation and skin. Do not rub menthol near your eyes, or over broken skin, a skin rash, or mucous membranes (such as inside your nose or mouth, or around your genitals and rectum).\n \n   \n   Make sure you do not get menthol in your eyes. Wash your hands well with soap and warm water after using menthol.\n \n   Do not use menthol on the skin of the treatment area during radiation therapy.\n \n  \n   \n \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            Written by\n        \n\n    \n        \n            References\n        \n"

        "text": "Developing a Pain Control Plan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n \n \n  \n  \n   Cancer pain is a personal experience and different for every person who has a cancer diagnosis. A plan to control pain needs to take into account a person's diagnosis, type and stage of cancer, other health problems, medications being taken, personal response to pain, and other personal choices. \n \n   Remember that only you know how much pain you are having. Telling your cancer care team when you’re in pain, and describing it the best way you can, is very important because pain is easier to treat when it first starts. Pain can also be an early warning sign of the side effects of your cancer treatment or some other problem. Together, you and your cancer care team can talk about how best to treat your pain. \n \n   Learning about cancer pain\n \n   Here are some things that might help you talk about pain with your cancer care team.\n \n    \n    Understand what causes cancer pain.\n \n    Know about different types of pain and how each type is treated.\n \n    Learn about opioid pain medicines and other medicines to manage pain.\n \n    Learn how pain medicines are given\n \n    Learn about other medical treatments and non-medical ways to help manage pain.\n \n    Know how to take your medicines safely.\n \n    Work with your doctors, nurses, and pharmacists to develop a pain control plan.\n \n    Talk with your cancer care team about your pain and how well your pain treatment plan is working.\n \n   \n \n   What you can expect from your cancer care teamand pain control plan\n  \n   Your cancer care team has certain responsibilities and a set of steps they follow to develop a pain control plan that works best for you. You should expect your doctor and cancer care team to do the following to develop a good pain control plan that works for you.\n \n    \n    Believe your descriptions of pain.\n \n    Take a careful history of your pain (called a ) after you report it and at every appointment.\n \n    Do a physical exam or other tests to understand the location and possible cause of the pain \n \n    Set goals about your pain based on how bad it is and what medicines you are willing to try.\n \n    Treat your pain based on the most recent research (called ).\n \n    Talk to you about how the pain control plan is working and make changes as needed. \n \n   \n \n   Pain assessment \n \n   The first step is for your cancer care team to talk with you about any pain you may be having. This is called doing a pain assessment. Your doctor or cancer care team should ask about your pain during your appointments. You need to be able to describe your pain to your cancer care team, and to give them a history about it. They can ask you questions and use certain tools that will help you use the right words so they know the type of pain you may be having, how bad it is, and how it may be affecting your activities and life. Your family or friends can help you talk about your pain, if you’re too tired or in too much pain to talk yourself. \n \n   Use a pain rating scale \n \n   Using a pain scale or another tool is a helpful way to describe how much pain you’re feeling. For example, here is a Pain Intensity Scale that is commonly used. To use it, you should, try to give your pain level a number from 0 to 10. If you have no pain, give it a 0. As the numbers get higher, they stand for pain that’s getting worse. A 10 means the worst pain you can imagine. For instance, you could say, “Right now, my pain is a 7 on a scale of 0 to 10.” \n \n   \n \n   You can use the rating scale to describe:\n \n    \n    How bad your pain is at its worst\n \n    What your pain is like most of the time\n \n    How bad your pain is at its best\n \n    How your pain changes with treatment\n \n   \n \n   Some pain rating scales use faces instead of numbers, and these may help you better describe how bad your pain is. Ask your cancer care team if they have another pain rating tool to use if you don't think numbers are the best way to describe it. \n \n   Give your cancer care team and your family and friends details about your pain\n  \n    \n    Where you feel pain\n \n    What it feels like (for instance, sharp, dull, throbbing, gnawing, burning, shooting, steady)\n \n    How strong the pain is (using the 0 to 10 scale)\n \n    How long it lasts\n \n    What eases the pain\n \n    What makes the pain worse\n \n    How the pain affects your daily life\n \n    What medicines you’re taking for the pain and how much relief you get from them\n \n   \n  \n   Your cancer care team may also need to know other details, like the ones listed here.\n \n    \n    All the medicines you’re taking now, including vitamins, minerals, herbs, supplements, and non-prescription medicines\n \n    The pain medicines you’ve taken in the past, including what has and has not worked for you\n \n    Any known allergies to medicines, foods, dyes, or additives\n \n   \n  \n   Pain Management\n \n   After a pain assessment, your cancer care team will work with you to find medicines and other ways to control or manage your pain. Making a decision about the best way to manage pain is based on how you have described your pain and how you have answered other questions. Choosing the best pain medicine should take into account what medicines work best for the type of pain you have and how bad it is, what side effects are possible, your activity level, and what other medications and treatments you are getting. \n \n   Questions you may want to ask about pain medicine include:\n \n    \n    What kind of pain medicine is this?\n \n    Do I need a prescription for this medicine? Is there a refill or do I need to call you for a refill?\n \n    What are the different names for this medicine?\n \n    How much should I take? (What’s the dose?)\n \n    Do I take it on a regular schedule or only when I need it? If only when I need it, how often can I take it?\n \n    How do I take it?\n \n    If my pain is not relieved, can I take more? If so, how much?\n \n    Should I call you before increasing the dose?\n \n    What if I forget to take it or take it too late?\n \n    Should I take the pain medicine with food?\n \n    How much liquid should I drink with the medicine?\n \n    How long does it take the medicine to start working?\n \n    Is it safe to drink alcohol or drive after I’ve taken this pain medicine? What should my limits be while taking it?\n \n    What other medicines can I take with the pain medicine?\n \n    What medicines should I stop taking or not take while I’m taking the pain medicine?\n \n    What are possible side effects from the medicine? How can I prevent them? What should I do if I have them?\n \n    Are there other safety concerns about this medicine?\n \n   \n \n   Palliative care as an option\n \n   Certain patients are helped by services from a palliative care team. A palliative care team has some of the same people on a cancer care team, but usually has others, including doctors, nurses, mental health specialists, social workers, chaplains, pharmacists, and dietitians. One of the goals of palliative care is to manage pain and other symptoms. The specialists that are part of a palliative care team can help to develop a pain control plan that works for you.\n  \n   Making the most of your pain control plan\n \n   To help make sure your pain control plan works well:\n \n    \n    If you’re taking pain medicine on a regular schedule (around the clock) to help control chronic pain, take it when it’s time to take it, even if you’re not having pain.\n \n    Do not skip doses of your scheduled medicine. The more pain you have, the harder it is to control.\n \n    Use your short-acting breakthrough pain medicine as instructed. Don’t wait for the pain to get worse – if you do, it can be harder to control.\n \n    Be sure only one doctor prescribes your pain medicine. If another doctor changes your medicine, the two doctors should discuss your treatment with each other.\n \n    Don’t run out of pain medicine. Remember that written prescriptions are needed for almost all pain medicines – they can’t be called in and drugstores don’t always have them in stock. It can take a few days to get the medicine, so give yourself time for delays. Sometimes you may need to pick up a prescription from the doctor because certain pain medicine prescriptions have to be taken in person to the pharmacy.\n \n    Store pain medicines safely away from children, pets, and others who might take them.\n \n    Never take someone else’s medicine. Medicines that helped a friend or relative may not be right for you.\n \n    Do not use old pain medicine or medicine left over from other problems. Drugs that worked for you in the past may not be right for you now.\n \n   \n \n   Keep a record of your pain\n \n   You may find it helpful to keep a record or a diary to track details about your pain and what works to ease it. You can share this record with those caring for you. This will help them figure out what method of pain control works best for you. Your records can include:\n \n    \n    Words to describe the pain (like sharp, dull, throbbing, gnawing, burning, shooting, steady)\n \n    Anything that seems to make the pain better or worse\n \n    Any activity that you can’t do because of the pain\n \n    The name, dose, and time you take your pain medicines\n \n    The times you use other pain-relief methods (such as relaxation techniques, distraction, or imagery)\n \n    The number you rate your pain at the time you use a pain-relief measure (medicine or method to reduce pain)\n \n    Your pain rating 1 to 2 hours after using the pain-relief measure\n \n    How long the pain medicine works\n \n    Your pain rating throughout the day (to get an idea of your general comfort)\n \n    How pain interferes with your normal activities, such as sleeping, eating, sex, or work\n \n    Any side effects you have that could be from the medicines\n \n   \n \n   You can print out a Pain Diary \nfrom our website, or call us to have it mailed to you. \n"

        "text": "Managing Cancer Pain at Home\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n \n \n  \nEach patient needs a personal plan to control cancer pain, and that plan needs to be able to work for you and your family. \n  \n  When people say they are having pain, it usually means they’re hurting somewhere. But it can also mean that they just can’t get comfortable. They could be feeling bad in general, not in any one place. The pain can feel worse if a person is sad, anxious, or depressed. Some people have a hard time talking about their pain. It’s important that you tell your cancer team about any pain you have and to describe it the best way you can.\n \n  Pain can be controlled in most people with cancer\n \n  Even severe pain can be controlled well by combinations of medicines that can be taken by mouth. Pain medicines work best if they are taken on a regular schedule before the pain becomes severe. You’ll want to treat pain when it first starts and regularly after that. If the cause of the pain can be treated with other methods, the need for medicine will slowly decrease or disappear as the cause is treated.\n \n  Pain control can improve quality of life\n \n  If you have pain from cancer that has spread or other long-term cancer pain, it can exhaust you. This type of pain can keep you from doing things that you want and need to do. Although cancer pain cannot always be fully relieved, there are ways to make it less severe and allow you to do many of your normal activities.\n \n  Even with around-the-clock pain medicines, pain often “breaks through” between doses. Breakthrough pain usually calls for a second pain medicine that you can safely take in addition to your regular pain medicine. Don’t be surprised if it takes more than 2 medicines to control your pain. Always tell your cancer care team how well your pain is being controlled so that medicines and doses can be adjusted as needed.\n \n  What to look for\n \n   \n   Pain that doesn’t seem to go away or that goes away and comes back before your next dose of pain medicine is due (This might mean that your medicine plan needs to be changed.)\n \n   Trouble sleeping\n \n   Lack of interest in things you used to enjoy\n \n   New areas of pain or a change in your pain\n \n   Less ability to move around or do things\n \n  \n \n  What the patient with cancer can do\n \n   \n   Talk with your cancer team about your pain – where it is, when it began, how long it lasts, what it feels like, what makes it better, what makes it worse, and how it affects your life.\n \n   If the prescribed pain medicines don’t work as expected, let your cancer team know.\n \n   Rate your pain using a pain rating scale, such as 0 = no pain to 10 = the worst pain you can imagine. You can use this scale to explain your pain to others.\n \n   Take your pain medicine exactly as prescribed. (For chronic pain, medicine should be given around the clock on a schedule, rather than only when pain is severe.) Check with your cancer team if this schedule needs to be adjusted.\n \n   As the pain is relieved with medicines, increase your activity level.\n \n   Don’t wait until the pain is severe before taking medicine for breakthrough pain.\n \n   Avoid suddenly stopping any of your pain medicines. Instead, reduce the dose slowly as the pain decreases. Ask your cancer team before you do this, or if you have questions.\n \n   Some people feel nauseated even when they’re taking the right dose of pain medicine. If your pain medicine makes you feel sick, ask your cancer team about changing it or trying something to control the nausea.\n \n   Some pain medicines make you sleepy or dizzy. This often gets better after a few days, but you may need help getting up or walking. Don’t try to drive or do anything dangerous until you are sure of the effects.\n \n   People taking pain medicines are normally given laxatives or stool softeners to prevent constipation, a common side effect.\n \n   Keep track of any other side effects you notice. Discuss them with your cancer team.\n \n   Do not crush or break your pain pills unless you get the OK from your cancer team. If medicines are in time-release form, taking broken pills can be dangerous.\n \n   If pain medicines are not keeping your pain under control, ask your cancer team about other measures. If you keep having trouble, ask to see a pain specialist.\n \n   Keep at least a one-week supply of pain medicines on hand. Most pain medicines can’t be refilled by phone, so you’ll need a written prescription.\n \n  \n \n  What caregivers can do\n \n   \n   Watch the patient for signs of pain. Ask the patient about pain if you notice grimacing, moaning, tension, or reluctance to move around in bed.\n \n   Try warm baths or warm washcloths on painful areas. (Avoid areas where radiation was given.) If this doesn’t help, you can try ice or cool packs. Gentle massage or pressure might also help some types of pain.\n \n   Watch for confusion and dizziness, especially after starting a new medicine or changing the dose. Help the patient walk until you know they can do it alone safely.\n \n   Suggest enjoyable activities to distract the patient.\n \n   Plan activities for when the patient is most comfortable and awake.\n \n   Offer plenty of fluids and food with fiber.\n \n   If the patient seems forgetful, help them track when pain medicines are due to avoid over- or under-dosing.\n \n   Help the patient remember to take stool softeners or laxatives suggested to prevent constipation.\n \n   If the patient is having trouble taking pills, ask the cancer care team about medicines that come in liquids, lozenges, suppositories, skin patches, or other forms.\n \n   Check with the cancer team before you crush or dissolve pain pills to make them easier to swallow. Some pills can cause a dangerous overdose if broken.\n \n   Talk with the cancer team so that you understand which medicines are for pain and how each is to be used.\n \n   Be sure that the patient has a complete list of all the medicines they are taking, including pain medicines.\n \n   If you help the patient use pain patches, be sure you know how to avoid touching the part with the pain medicine on it and how to dispose of used patches safely.\n \n   Keep pain medicines away from others, especially children and pets.\n \n   When you are caring for someone with pain, plan time for activities you enjoy and take care of yourself. A support group for family members may be helpful.\n \n  \n \n  Call the cancer team if the patient:\n \n   \n   Has new or worse pain\n \n   Can’t take anything by mouth, including the pain medicine\n \n   Doesn’t get pain relief, or if the relief doesn’t last long enough\n \n   Has trouble waking up, or if you have trouble keeping them awake\n \n   Becomes constipated, nauseated, or confused\n \n   Has any questions about how to take the medicines\n \n   Develops a new symptom (for instance, is unable to walk, eat, or urinate)\n"

        "text": "Shortness of Breath\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n \n \n  \nCancer and its treatment may cause shortness of breath or a feeling of not being able to catch your breath (breathlessness).  This is called . Sometimes you can become short of breath quickly \n    , and it can be quite frightening. Other times, it can be mild and bothersome when doing daily activities . When people have trouble breathing, the body might not be getting enough oxygen because the lungs can’t take in enough air or the body can’t get enough oxygen through the bloodstream.\n \n  For many people with advanced cancers, shortness of breath comes on over time rather than quickly. There are things that can be done to help make people with advanced cancers more comfortable.\n \n  People with cancer can have different causes of shortness of breath, such as:\n \n   \n   Tumors in or near the lung\n \n   Other lung or breathing disorders\n \n   Side effects of cancer treatment (such as surgery, chemo, targeted therapy, immunotherapy, or radiation)\n \n   Fluid in or around the lungs or heart\n \n   A blocked airway\n \n   Pneumonia (a lung infection)\n \n   Weakened breathing muscles\n \n   Lack of regular physical activity\n \n   Obesity\n \n   \n \n   Poor nutrition\n \n   Stress or anxiety\n \n   Allergic or infusion reactions\n \n   Anemia or changes in blood counts\n \n  \n \n  What to look for\n \n   \n   Shortness of breath, or a feeling of breathlessness\n \n   Trouble breathing when resting, eating, talking, or with exercise\n \n   Chest pain\n \n   Faster breathing\n \n   Faster heartbeat\n \n   Pale or bluish-looking skin, fingernail beds, and mouth\n \n   Cold and clammy feeling skin\n \n   Nostrils flaring when inhaling\n \n   Wheezing\n \n  \n \n  Sometimes a patient may have chest discomfort or difficulty breathing but may not show obvious symptoms like exertion or rapid breaths and pulse.\n \n  What the patient can do\n \n   \n   Stay calm.\n \n   \n \n   Sit up or raise your upper body to a 45° angle by raising the bed or using pillows.\n \n   Take medicine or treatments prescribed for breathing (for example, oxygen, medicine for relief of wheezing, inhalers, or nebulizers).\n \n   If you’re not in a lot of distress, check your temperature and pulse.\n \n   Inhale deeply through your nose and exhale through pursed lips for twice as long as it took to inhale. (This is called .)\n \n   If you’re still not breathing easier after 5 minutes, sit up on the side of the bed, with your feet resting on a stool, arms resting on an overbed table (tray table) or side table with pillows on it, and your head tilted slightly forward.\n \n   If you’re coughing and spitting, note the amount of sputum and what it looks and smells like.\n \n   Tell your cancer care team how your breathing problem affects you, especially if you avoid some of your usual activities to keep from getting out of breath.\n \n   Try muscle relaxation to reduce anxiety. Anxiety makes breathing problems worse.\n \n   If you keep having trouble breathing, ask about medicines that might help.\n \n  \n \n  What caregivers can do\n \n   \n   Using a watch with a second hand or timer to check the patient’s pulse, count the number of beats per minute. (If you also count the number of breaths per minute, do it without telling the patient. If the patient knows you’re counting, they may slow down or speed up breathing without realizing it.)\n \n   \n \n   Check the patient’s temperature to see if they have a fever.\n \n   Offer medicines or inhalers prescribed for shortness of breath.\n \n   If home oxygen is prescribed, be sure you know how to set it up, use it safely, and what flow rate to use. (Do not change the flow rate without first talking to the health care team.)\n \n   When the patient feels short of breath, remove or loosen tight clothing.\n \n   Have the patient sit up in a resting position that feels comfortable to them.\n \n   Remind them to breathe in slowly and deeply, then exhale slowly.\n \n   Remove the patient from extreme temperatures, especially heat, which can make it harder to breathe.\n \n   Notice when the patient gets out of breath. (During normal activity, while talking, or when they are at rest?) Also note if it happens when they’re standing, sitting, or lying down.\n \n  \n  \n  \n \n  Call the cancer care team if the patient\n \n   \n   Has trouble breathing or chest pain\n \n   Has thick, yellow, green, and/or bloody sputum\n \n   Develops pale or bluish skin, nail beds, or mouth; or if their skin feels cold and clammy\n \n   Has a temperature not related to a cold or the flu, that's above what's considered normal for the patient or above a certain level as instructed by the cancer care team\n \n   Has flared nostrils during breathing\n \n   Becomes confused or restless\n \n   Has trouble speaking\n \n   Has dizziness or weakness\n \n   Has swelling of the face, neck, or arms\n \n   Starts wheezing\n"

You might hear your cancer care team refer to itching as . In cancer patients, itching can be causedby:\n \n    \n    Cancer treatments such as chemotherapy, radiation, targeted therapy, or immunotherapy\n \n    The cancer itself\n \n    Certain medications used as part of cancer treatment such as pain medicines, drugs for nausea or vomiting, or hormone treatments\n \n    Other causes of itching may include dry skin, infection, or a condition that is not cancer\n \n   \n \n   Continuous itching can cause your skin to break, bleed, or get an infection especially if the skin is broken. Itching can be a sign of an infection, so be sure to let your doctor know about any new itching you might be experiencing. It is important that you know and communicate to your cancer care team what might make your itching worse or better so you can protect your skin and stay comfortable.\n \n   What to look for\n \n    \n    Dry, red, rough, flaky skin\n \n    A yellowing of the skin or of the whites of eyes\n \n    Rash or bumps\n \n    Scratch marks\n \n    Skin sores\n \n    Scratching when you don’t notice it\n \n   \n \n   What the patient can do\n \n   To soothe the skin\n \n    \n    Ask your pharmacist about skin creams that don’t contain alcohols or fragrances. Apply them 2 to 3 times a day, especially after a bath when the skin is damp. Ask your cancer care team which creams might be safe for you.\n \n    Bathe in warm water instead of hot.\n \n    Add baking soda, oatmeal (in a cloth or mesh bag), or bath oil to your bath water.\n \n    Wash your skin gently using a mild, unscented soap and a soft washcloth.\n \n    When drying off, try not to rub your skin. Instead, gently pat your skin dry.\n \n    Use baking soda instead of deodorant.\n \n    Avoid using scented or alcohol-based products on the skin (such as powders, after-shaves, or perfumes). Cornstarch-based powders may clump in moist areas and cause irritation.\n \n    Use an electric razor rather than a blade to avoid cuts and irritation.\n \n    Keep your room cool (60° to 70° F) and well ventilated to avoid sweating.\n \n    Wear loose-fitting clothes made of soft fabric to avoid irritating your skin.\n \n    Drink plenty of water and other fluids.\n \n    Get enough rest. Ask about medicine (antihistamines) if itching keeps you awake.\n \n    Ask your cancer care team for tips that might help reduce or prevent itching. If your itching is severe, your doctor may order prescription drugs to help relieve the itching.\n \n   \n \n   To reduce the desire to scratch\n \n    \n    Apply cool, wet packs (such as crushed ice in a plastic bag wrapped in a damp towel) to the skin. Remove the pack when it becomes warm, and let your skin dry. Use again as needed.\n \n    Keep nails clean and short. Wear clean fabric gloves if you scratch without thinking about it.\n \n    Try rubbing, pressure, cool cloths, or vibration instead of scratching. Avoid breaking the skin.\n \n    Wear loose, soft clothing.\n \n    Distract yourself with music, reading, and the company of others.\n \n    Take medicines for itching as prescribed.\n \n   \n \n   What caregivers can do\n \n    \n    Try using mild, unscented detergents to wash the patient’s clothes and bedding.\n \n    If the patient scratches in their sleep, ask them to wear clean cotton gloves to reduce the chance of skin damage.\n \n   \n \n   Call the cancer care team if the patient\n \n    \n    Has itching that does not go away after 2 or more days\n \n    Develops yellowish skin or has urine the color of tea\n \n    Scratches skin until it’s open or bleeding\n \n    Has a rash that gets worse after creams or ointments have been used\n \n    Has blisters, bright red skin, or crusts on the skin\n \n    Has foul-smelling drainage or has pus coming from the skin\n \n    Becomes very anxious and restless (can’t sleep through the night due to itching)\n \n    Develops hives (itchy white or red welts on the skin), shortness of breath, swelling of the throat or face, or other signs of a severe allergic reaction\n"

        "text": "Skin Rash\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n \n \n  \nA skin rash is a common side effect of certain types of cancer treatments. Cancer treatments that can cause skin rash may include chemotherapy, radiation therapy, immunotherapy, targeted therapy, and stem cell transplant. \n \n  Skin rashes can show up on the scalp, face, neck, chest, upper back, and sometimes on other parts of the body. Rashes can itch, burn, sting, or be painful. They usually develop within a few weeks of receiving the treatment, but can develop at any time during your cancer treatment. \n \n  It's important to know that a skin rash that is an expected side effect of treatment is not considered an allergy or allergic reaction. However, just like any medicine, people can have allergies to chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and targeted therapy drugs. \n \n  A skin rash that develops suddenly while you are receiving a drug used to treat cancer could be a sign that you are allergic to that drug.\n  \n  Some common types of rashes experienced by patients receiving treatment include:\n \n   \n   : This is a rash that may be itchy and painful and commonly occurs on the chest, upper back, or face. It is common in patients who receive certain treatment drugs.\n \n   : This is a rash that develops in patients receiving radiation therapy. It usually occurs in the area of the skin getting radiation. It may be mild or severe depending on the location of the radiation, how much skin was affected, total radiation dose, and how long the radiation is given.\n \n   : This is a rash that develops in an area of the body that has previously had radiation therapy. It sometimes happens when a person receives chemotherapy or targeted therapy drugs\n      after completing radiation therapy.\n \n   :Certain patients may develop this condition, which causes redness, swelling, pain, and sometimes tingling in the palms of the hands and soles of the feet.\n \n  \n \n  Talk to your cancer care team about the treatment you are receiving and if you are at risk of developing a skin rash. Let your doctor know if you notice any rash, big or small.\n \n  What the patient can do\n \n   \n   Talk to your cancer care team about your rash and what they recommend to help the rash get better. Your cancer care team may recommend mild soaps, lotions, and moisturizers. In certain cases, your doctor may prescribe medication to help with the rash.\n \n   Clean the skin gently with warm water, gentle soap, and a soft cloth\n \n   Rinse the rash area carefully and pat dry\n \n   Keep your skin moisturized\n \n   Protect the affected area from heat and cold\n \n   Stay out of the sun as much as possible, because sunlight seems to trigger and/or worsen rashes in some people. If you’ll be outside during the day, wear a hat and clothes with long sleeves. Use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with SPF of at least 30 and zinc oxide or titanium dioxide at least 1 hour before going out. Be careful near windows too.\n \n   Wear loose-fitting, soft clothing.\n \n   Apply medicines prescribed for skin reactions.\n \n   Protect all of your skin from the sun. For instance, wear a wide-brimmed hat, sunglasses, and long-sleeved shirts when outside.\n \n  \n \n  What caregivers can do\n \n   \n   Keep track of any new drugs, soaps, detergents, or foods that might have caused a rash\n \n   Help the patient apply medications and creams to areas they can't reach\n \n  \n \n  Call the cancer care team if the patient\n \n   \n   Has a rash that gets worse after creams or ointments have been used\n \n   Has itching that does not go away after 2 or more days\n \n   Scratches skin until it’s open or bleeding\n \n   Has a rash that is uncomfortable and keeps them up at night\n \n   Has blisters, bright red skin, or crusts on the skin\n \n   Has foul-smelling drainage or pus coming from the skin\n \n   Develops yellowish skin or has urine the color of tea\n \n  \n \n   \n \n \n\n\n"

        "text": "Skin Color Changes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n \n \n  \n \n   Skin changes color usually because  something is going on in the body. For example, a person may look yellow because of liver problems, slightly blue because of breathing problems, bruised because of blood disorders, or pink or red because of skin problems or extra sensitivity to sunlight. In cancer patients, changes in the skin color can be due to the side effects of cancer treatment , tumor growth, or sun exposure. Some color changes may improve over time, while others may be long lasting. \n \n   Certain patients may have a condition called hand-foot syndrome\n     , which causes redness, swelling, pain, and sometimes tingling in the palms of the hands and soles of the feet.\n \n   Talk to your cancer care team about your treatment and the risk for changes in your skin color, and let them know if you notice any.\n \n   What to look for\n \n    \n    Yellowish skin and/or the whites of the eyes. May also have deep orange to brown urine  and/or white or clay-colored (light brown or gray-looking) stools.\n \n    Bruises or areas of blue or purple skin that have no known cause\n \n    Very pale or blue-tinged skin, lips, or nail beds. Often with trouble breathing.\n \n    Redness or rash on skin\n \n    Swelling in an area that’s discolored\n \n    \n \n   \n \n   What the patient can do\n \n    \n    Clean the skin gently with warm water, gentle soap, and a soft cloth.\n \n    Rinse the affected area carefully and pat dry.\n \n    Ask your cancer care team what the best skin products for the affected skin may be. Keep your skin moisturized.\n \n    Protect the affected area from heat and cold.\n \n    Wear loose-fitting, soft clothing.\n \n    Apply medicines prescribed for skin reactions.\n \n    Protect all of your skin from the sun. (For instance, wear a wide-brimmed hat, sunglasses, and long-sleeved shirts when outside.)\n \n    Apply broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher on any skin exposed to the sun. Re-apply every 2 hours if in the sun, and after bathing or sweating.\n \n   \n \n   What caregivers can do\n  \n    \n    If a patient’s hands are affected, do not let the patient do tasks involving hot water.\n     \n \n    Offer gentle massages with moisturizing lotions or creams.\n \n   \n \n   Call the cancer care team if the patient\n \n    \n    Develops yellowish skin or whites of the eyes (or has urine that stays dark or orange for a day or more and/or stool that looks white or clay-colored for 2 or more bowel movements)\n \n    Has severe itching\n \n    Has bruises that don’t go away within a week, or new bruises showing up for 3 days\n \n    Has pink or red patches or rash-like areas on the skin\n"

        "text": "Pressure Sores\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n \n \n  \n \n   A pressure sore develops when the blood supply to an area of the body is blocked because there is excessive and prolonged pressure on it. As a result, the skin in that area starts to die, leading to an open crater-like area or ulcer in the skin. These areas on the skin can be called , pressure sores, pressure ulcers, or pressure injuries. \n \n   A person who stays in the same position for a long time, for example, someone who is bedridden or always in a chair or wheelchair puts pressure on the same places much of the time. This reduces the blood flow to these places, making them more likely to develop pressure sores. These areas can be made worse when sheets rub against them or the patient is roughly pulled up in the bed or chair. \n \n   Common places for pressure sores to develop are the hips, buttocks, heels, elbows, shoulders, ears, and back of the head.\n \n   What to look for\n \n    \n    Cracked, blistered, scaly, or broken skin\n \n    An open sore on the skin’s surface or in the tissue under the skin\n \n    Yellowish stains on clothing, sheets, or chairs (may be tinged with blood)\n \n    Painful or tender “pressure points” (such as on the back of the head, ears, back of shoulders, elbows, buttocks, hips, heels, or any place a bony part rests on a surface)\n \n    Red pressure points on the skin that don’t go away even after the pressure is removed (can be an early sign that skin is about to break down or die)\n \n   \n \n   What the patient can do\n \n    \n    Move around as much as you can and change positions frequently\n \n    If you are in bed, change your position at least every 2 hours from your left side, to your back, to your right side.\n \n    In a wheelchair, shift your weight every 15 minutes. Use special foam or gel seat cushions to reduce pressure.\n \n    Choose clothing that isn’t too tight or so loose that it bunches up under you.\n \n    Protect other “pressure points” with pillows to help prevent new sores. If possible, use a pressure-reducing mattress or 3- to 4-inch foam layer over your mattress.\n \n    Exercise as much as possible. Try to take a short walk 2 or 3 times a day. If you can’t walk, pull up, and move your arms and legs up and down and back and forth.\n \n    Eat foods high in protein (such as fish, eggs, meats, milk, nuts, or peanut butter).\n \n    Increase fluids. (If you’re not eating well, try high-calorie liquids such as milkshakes or canned liquid food supplements). Be sure to check with your cancer care team on how much fluid you can safely drink.\n \n    Always protect the sore and the area around it with a foam wedge or pillow.\n \n    Rinse any open sore with water very carefully and cover with a bandage that has been approved by your cancer care team. Do this every time the bandage gets soiled, or at least twice a day as instructed. If you’re given ointments or creams, use them as directed. Report any itching, blistering, new drainage, or increase in size of the sore to your cancer team.\n \n   \n \n   What caregivers can do\n \n    \n    Encourage the patient to move around as much as they can.\n \n    Remind the patient to change positions often, or help the patient turn every 2 hours if they're in bed.\n \n    If the patient can’t control their bowels and bladder, change their underwear as soon as you notice soiling. After cleaning, apply an ointment (such as A+D ointment) to keep the area dry. Use underpads to keep the patient from soiling the bed and to make it easier to clean up. Don’t use plastic underwear unless the patient is out of bed.\n \n    If the skin has an open sore, ask about special dressings to help protect it.\n \n   \n \n   If the patient can’t get out of bed\n \n    \n    If you notice a reddened “pressure area” (an area that stays red after pressure is taken off it), keep the pressure off it as much as you can to try to prevent further breakdown. Use pillows and have the patient change position often.\n \n    Check the patient’s back and sides each day to be sure that the skin looks normal. Pay special attention to pressure areas such as the tailbone, hipbones, knees, ankles, heels, shoulders, and elbows.\n \n    Keep the head of bed flat or no higher than a 30° angle.\n \n    Keep the bottom sheets pulled tight to prevent wrinkles.\n \n    If the patient has trouble staying on their side, ask about foam wedges to help hold positions.\n \n    Ask your cancer team if you can get a home health nurse to visit and help you make a plan to care for and prevent further skin problems.\n \n    Ask if you can get foam, gel, or air cushions for the bed and chairs. Find out about special beds that help reduce pressure.\n \n   \n \n   Call the cancer care teamif the patient\n \n    \n    Has a reddened \"pressure area\" that is not getting better after repositioning\n \n    Has cracked, blistered, scaly, or broken skin\n \n    Has a sore that’s getting bigger\n \n    Has a thick or bad-smelling liquid draining from the sore\n \n    Needs help from a home care agency for wound care and supplies\n"

        "text": "Scars and Wounds\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n \n \n  \n \n   A wound is a physical injury to the body that causes damage to the structure of the area injured. The wound may be under the skin, may affect only the skin surface, or might affect the skin surface and beneath it.\n \n   Types of wounds include an incision (cut) from surgery, a laceration (cut) from a sharp object, or a bruise, tear, fracture or other injury that is under the skin, in a muscle or tendon, or on a bone or organ. A wound can be caused by a medical procedure, fall or accident, tumor growth, or pressure on bony areas. Proper care for a wound is important to protect it from infection and help it heal.\n \n   Scars  form as wounds to the skin heal.  They are a natural part of the healing process as the body mends damage from skin that has been cut. The new tissue formed by a scar will have a different feel and texture than the skin around it.\n \n   Let your cancer care team know if you notice any wounds so they can be cared for promptly.\n \n   What to look for\n \n    \n    Redness or purple bruising of skin\n \n    Scaly, broken skin \n \n    Crusts, scabs, or cuts in the skin\n \n    Bleeding\n \n    Swelling\n \n    Drainage or pus\n \n    Warmth or heat at the affected area\n \n    Pain or tenderness\n \n   \n \n   What the patient can do\n \n    \n    Wash your hands well before and after changing a wound dressing. Never re-use dressings.\n \n    Always keep the wound clean. Unless you were given different instructions, clean the wound every day with soap and water, rinse well, and pat it dry with a clean towel.\n \n    Dress wounds as instructed, or use sterile, non-stick gauze. Use paper tape if you can.\n \n    Keep your dressing clean and dry. If it gets wet or dirty, change it right away.\n \n    If the wound is bleeding, clean it well and apply moderate pressure with a cool cloth or ice pack until the bleeding stops. Then continue with the dressing change.\n \n    Try not to put tape right on the skin. Use a “skin prep” solution to protect skin where the tape goes, or wrap gauze over the bandage and then tape the gauze. Check with your nurse or pharmacist about supplies.\n \n    Only use wound dressings, skin prep solutions, tapes, and other supplies approved by your care team.\n      \n \n    If you have any medications prescribed, such as antibiotics, take them as instructed\n \n    Avoid scratching or rubbing the wound. Don’t remove scabs.\n \n    Eat citrus fruits, green leafy vegetables, whole grains, meat, fish, and eggs. They contain protein, vitamins, and minerals that help promote wound healing.\n \n    Let your doctor know if your wound is painful. He or she might be able to order some pain medicine to help with the pain.\n \n   \n \n   What caregivers can do\n \n    \n    Help clean wounds or change dressings if the patient can’t do it alone. If you can, wear a fresh pair of disposable plastic gloves each time you clean the area and put on a new dressing. Wash your hands before and after changing a dressing, even if you wear gloves.\n \n    Be sure the patient has enough supplies to change the dressing as often as instructed.\n \n    Check for signs of infection (redness, swelling, tenderness, drainage or pus).\n \n   \n \n   Call the cancer care teamif the patient\n \n    \n    Has a wound that bleeds for a long time and doesn't stop when pressure is applied\n \n    Has a wound that looks very red around the edges and is hot or swollen\n \n    Has more pain than usual at the wound site\n \n    Has a bad smell coming from the wound\n \n    Has yellow pus or greenish liquid that oozes from the wound\n \n    Has any changes in the skin around the wound\n \n    Has a fever (your cancer care team will let you know what they consider a fever)\n"

        "text": "What Are Sleep Problems?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n \n \n  \nSleep problems can be common in cancer patients. You might hear these called sleep disturbances orsleep-wake disturbances.  They can affect a person's ability to do everyday activities.  Any change in usual sleeping habits can affect you in different ways.\n     \n \n  It's important to remember that everyone is different. But sleep is key to having good physical and mental health, and for our mood and well-being. Because of this, having a good sleep routine or good  is important.\n \n  For most adults, averaging at least seven hours of sleep every night is recommended. But, your age, stage in life, home and work life, and stress, along with non-cancer related conditions can affect sleep. People might describe sleep problems as having insomnia or sleep deprivation, but there are things that can help. \n \n  For people with cancer, common types of sleep problems include:\n \n   \n   Feeling overly weak and more tired than usual, or feeling the need to rest and sleep more (fatigue).\n \n   Having trouble getting to sleep or staying asleep (insomnia).\n \n   Getting too much sleep which might affect your activities during the day.\n \n   Taking too many naps during the day which might affect your sleep at night.\n \n   Things that don't allow good sleep at night, such as being hot or cold, needing to use the bathroom, sleep-walking, nightmares, or sleep terrors.\n \n  \n \n  Sometimes changes in sleep are temporary, while others or may last several months to years after cancer treatment. This can lead to having lower energy levels and can affect tasks at home, work, or school. It can also affect your enjoyment of social activities, friends, family, or hobbies. \n \n  It's important to report sleep problems and talk to your health care team about ways to manage more consistent sleep.\n   \n  What causes sleep problems?\n \n  Cancer and its treatment\n \n  For people with cancer, some reasons for changes in usual sleeping habits or sleeping problems include:\n \n   \n   Certain surgeries, radiation therapy, treatment drugs or hormone therapy\n \n   Medications related to cancer and non-cancer conditions\n \n   Side effects related to cancer, cancer treatment, or medications that might include: \n     \n     \n \n     Pain,\n \n     Anxiety and worrying\n \n     Depression \n \n     \n \n     \n \n     \n \n     \n \n     \n \n     \n \n    \n \n \n  \n   \n  Insomnia\n \n  When you have difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep it is called . It can last for a night, a few days or weeks, several months or longer. Temporary or short periods of insomnia, lasting less than three months, is called \n. When insomnia lasts for long periods of time, it can be more serious and may require trying different ways to manage it. There can be several causes for insomnia, such as depression, anxiety, different medications, drinking alcohol or caffeine, or using tobacco. Talk to your doctor about ways to manage insomnia.\n \n  Restless legs syndrome\n \n  Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a condition that can be uncomfortable and interrupt your sleep.  It causes the urge to move your legs when you're trying to rest or sleep. Sometimes your legs can also feel itchy or irritated, often causing jerking movements that keep you awake. RLS usually happens more during the evening hours. Talk to your doctor about ways to manage RLS.\n \n  Sleep apnea\n \n  Sleep apnea is also called . Apnea is a short pause in your breathing pattern that can sometimes last as long as ten seconds.  It can be mild to serious, depending on how often the episodes happen. Sleep apnea might happen simply because airway or throat muscles become very relaxed. But sometimes there is an obstruction, or blockage that causes the breathing pattern to change. \n \n  Certain risk factors for sleep apnea are: sleep position, neck size, an unusual or change in the placement of your chin or jaw, tobacco or alcohol use, or family or genetic history. Many people with sleep apnea snore and their breathing patterns can wake them up them during the night. Sometimes this interrupted sleep pattern causes tiredness or sleepiness during the day.\n \n  Although th﻿is disruption in your breathing pattern only lasts several seconds, it can cause serious problems if it happens often. It can lead to low oxygen levels, high blood pressure (hypertension), heart conditions, or mood and memory changes. Talk to your doctor about tests to find sleep apnea and how to manage it.\n \n  Lifestyle habits\n \n  Other factors that can raise the risk for sleep problems could be related to lifestyle, environment, and habits. Not getting enough daily physical activity, being around lots of noise, taking longer naps, falling asleep outside the bedroom, watching long hours of television or having long hours of other types of screen time, using tobacco products, drinking alcohol and caffeine, and not taking in enough nutrients can all affect sleep. \n"

        "text": "Managing Sleep Problems\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n \n \n  \nSleep problems (sometimes called sleep disturbances or sleep-wake disturbances) can happen for many reasons, and people with cancer often have an increased risk for them. \n \n  Lab tests, such as a sleep study, might help find what might be causing your sleep problem. But most of the time, diagnosing a sleep problem depends on the patient reporting it. \n \n  Your doctor may give you a form or checklist to fill out about your sleep habits and problems. If not, here are some questions to think about when tracking your sleep patterns and writing down notes for your health care team:\n \n   \n   Do you have problems falling asleep?\n \n   Do you have problems staying asleep?\n \n   Do you wake up too early?\n \n   How often do you wake up at night?\n \n   Why do you think you're waking up? For example, are you having dreams or do you need to use the bathroom? Are you in pain? Do you need to get up to take medication at night? Do you often need to care for others at night?\n \n   Do you wake up because you feel you're gasping for breath?\n \n   Have other people said you snore or stop breathing when you sleep?\n \n   What medication are you taking and when do you take it?\n \n   What do you drink or eat in the few hours before going to bed? How late do you eat or drink in the evening?\n \n   What activities are you doing during the day and then in the few hours before going to bed?\n \n   How often do you nap? And for how long?\n \n   Do you fall asleep in places other than bed?\n \n   How often do you feel tired or sleepy during the day?\n \n   Are you able to do your usual daily activities at work and home? If not, how are they affected?\n \n  \n \n  Finding out the best way to manage a sleep problem can begin with how you describe it to your health care team. It's best to keep a sleep diary. This is useful for tracking your sleep patterns and writing down the specific problems you're having will help. Someone who lives with you can often help describe what happens when your sleep is disturbed.\n \n  Improving sleep \n \n  Because sleep problems in people with cancer usually have more than one cause, doctors, nurses, sleep specialists, social workers, therapists, pharmacists, dietitians and nutritionists, and a number of other professionals might be involved in helping manage them. You might hear this referred to as having a . The best sleep hygiene plan for you might be different for someone else. Sometimes the plan includes some testing, lifestyle changes, medication changes, or techniques and therapies that help with relaxation.\n \n   \n  \n \n  Relaxation and exercise\n \n  If relaxing seems to be difficult, you might be able to learn about different relaxation techniques that can help. These are often called . They might include breathing exercises, meditation, mindfulness, music, hypnosis, or guided imagery that can help you relax physically and mentally. These can help you learn ways that let you wind down, stay calm, fall asleep, stay asleep, and go back to sleep if you awaken during the night. \n \n  Exercise as a way to promote better sleep has been studied in people with cancer, and might be helpful.\n \n  It's important to talk to your health care team about whether these might be helpful for your situation, to find professionals who can help you learn these techniques.\n \n  Insomnia\n \n  Insomnia might be managed by adjusting lifestyle, activities, or medications.\n \n  Some medication or sleep aids can be used temporarily, whether they are prescribed by your doctor or over-the counter. But it's important to talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking any medication or supplement that claims to be helpful for sleep and relaxation. More research is needed to understand how these medications can better help cancer patients, and if they are safe to take. Possible interactions may occur with these because of other medications, vitamins, or herbals you take. Some  sleep aids your doctor might recommend or prescribe include:\n \n   \n   Zolpidem, Zolpidem CR (Ambien and other brands)\n \n   Eszopiclone (Lunesta)\n \n   Ramelteon (Rozerem)\n \n   Temazepam (Restoril)\n \n  \n \n  Restless legs syndrome\n \n  Restless legs syndrome (RLS) might be managed with different treatment or therapy options. Your doctor may check your iron or vitamin levels with a blood test to see if adding iron, B12, or folate in your diet may help. A therapist may help you with daily stretching exercises to help you relax your muscles. If needed, some common medicines your doctor might recommend or prescribe for RLS include:\n \n   \n   Iron \n \n   Gabapentin (Neurontin and other brands) or gabapentin enacarbil (Horizant)\n \n   Different types of pain relievers or opioids \n \n   Clonazepam (Klonopin)\n \n  \n \n  Sleep apnea\n \n  Your doctor may order a sleep study to diagnose sleep apnea. This study may require you to stay overnight at a sleep center. The sleep specialist at the center will monitor different sleep functions like heart rate, breathing, airflow, and oxygen blood levels. \n \n  A continuous positive airway pressure devise (CPAP) mask may be prescribed as a treatment. The mask is placed on your face, secured with elastic, and attaches to a machine that gently blows air to keep your throat and airway open while you sleep. It is usually recommended this mask be used every night during sleep. \n \n  Changes in daily diet or exercise may also help with sleep apnea. A dietitian, your doctor, or sleep specialist can help you start a plan that works for you. \n \n  What the patient can do\n \n   \n   Keep a sleep diary. You can track your sleep by writing down the time and patterns of your sleep and naps. Include anything special you might notice when you first wake up or if you remember anything that might be different from a usual routine. A person who is with you at home or during the night can help describe these too.\n \n   Talk with your health care team if you' notice a change in sleeping patterns. \n \n   Review your list of over-the-counter or prescribed medicines with your health care teamDifferent medications, sleeping pills, or pain relievers can affect sleep.\n \n   Take your medications at the same time every day, and make sure your health care team knows the schedule for them.\n \n   Talk to your doctor about a referral to a sleep specialist, if needed.\n \n   Sleep as much as your body tells you to, but when you’re awake, try to limit nap time and try to exercise at least once a day. Talk to your health care team about an exercise plan that you can follow before, during, and after your cancer treatment. \n \n   Avoid caffeine for at least 6 to 8 hours before bedtime – longer if it affects your sleep.\n    \n \n   Avoid alcohol. \n \n   Try  warm, caffeine-free drinks, such as warm milk or decaf tea, before sleep.\n \n   Use a quiet setting for rest at the same time each day. Take short daytime naps if needed (less than an hour) to avoid interfering with nighttime sleep.\n \n  \n   \n   \n   Keep sheets clean, neatly tucked in, and as free from wrinkles as possible.\n \n  \n  \n  What caregivers can do\n \n   \n   Help keep the room quiet and comfortable during sleep.\n \n   Help keep a sleep diary that records total sleep time, total nap time, quality of sleep, and side effects or other problems that may affect sleep each day.\n \n   Offer gentle backrubs or foot massages near bedtime.\n \n   Offer a light bedtime snack.\n \n   Let the cancer team know if the patient seems to be confused during the night.\n \n  \n \n  Call the cancer care team if the patient\n \n   \n   Is confused at night\n \n   Is sleeping very little or can’t sleep at all at night\n \n   Seems to stop breathing frequently while sleeping\n"

This can be caused by retaining salt and water because of certain medicines. It can also be a sign of heart, liver, or kidney damage or failure. Other causes might include surgery, infection, poor nutrition, tumor growth, or a blockage. \n \n  Swelling that happens because lymph nodes are blocked or removed causes lymph flow to be impaired. This is called lymphedema \n    \n \n  Some medications, like diuretics, can help edema.  Diuretics are often called water pills. They stimulate your kidneys to remove sodium and water from your body, so you'll urinate more often and get rid of extra fluid. But diuretics can have possible dangerous side effects. Talk to your doctor to learn more about this if you are prescribed diuretics for swelling or edema.\n \n  "

Ascites is common in some cancers that have reached the advanced stages and spread in the abdominal area, including cancer of the ovary, liver, colon, stomach, or pancreas. Sometimes chemotherapy or surgery might help manage ascites.  More often, a procedure is done to drain the fluid, called a paracentesis.

        "text": "How Targeted Therapies Are Used to Treat Cancer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n \n \n  \nWhat is targeted therapy?\n \n  Targeted therapy is a type of cancer treatment that uses drugs designed to \"target\" cancer cells without affecting normal cells. \n \n  Cancer cells typically have changes in their genes that make them different from normal cells. Genes are part of a cell's DNA that tell the cell to do certain things. When a cell has certain gene changes, it doesn't behave like a normal cell. For example, gene changes in cancer cells might allow the cell to grow and divide very quickly. These types of changes are what make it a cancer cell. \n \n  But there are many different types of cancer, and not all cancer cells are the same. For example, colon cancer and breast cancer cells have different gene changes that help them grow and/or spread. Even among different people with the same general type of cancer (such as colon cancer), the cancer cells can have different gene changes, making one person's specific type of colon cancer different from another person's.\n \n  Researchers have also learned that the environment in which different cancers start, grow, and thrive are not always the same.  For example, some cancers have certain types of proteins or enzymes send certain messages to tell the cancer cell to grow and copy itself. \n \n  Knowing these details has led to the development of drugs that can “target” these proteins or enzymes and block the messages being sent. Targeted drugs can block or turn off signals that make cancer cells grow, or can signal the cancer cells to destroy themselves. \n \n  \n \n  Targeted therapy is an important type of cancer treatment, and researchers will develop more targeted drugs as they learn more about specific changes in cancer cells. But so far, only a few type of cancers are routinely treated using only these drugs. Most people getting targeted therapy also need surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or hormone therapy.\n \n  How is targeted therapy different from chemotherapy?\n   \n  Targeted therapy drugs, like other drugs used to treat cancer, are technically considered chemotherapy. But targeted therapy drugs don’t work the same way as traditional or standard chemotherapy (chemo) drugs. Targeted drugs zero in on some of the changes that make cancer cells different from normal cells. This makes them work differently from chemotherapy in two key ways:\n \n   \n   Because of their targeted action, these drugs have an effect on the cancer cells and mostly leave normal, healthy cells alone. Traditional chemotherapy is cytotoxic\n to most cells, meaning it can damage normal, healthy cells in addition to damaging and killing cancer cells. \n \n   Targeted drugs often work by blocking cancer cells from copying themselves. This means they can help stop a cancer cell from dividing and making new cancer cells. Traditional chemotherapy, however, kills cancer cells that have already been made. \n \n  \n \n  How targeted therapy works\n \n  Targeted therapies are made to find and attack specific areas or substances in cancer cells, or can detect and block certain kinds of messages sent inside a cancer cell that tell it to grow. Some of the substances in cancer cells that become the \"targets\" of targeted therapies are:\n \n   \n   Too much of a certain protein on a cancer cell\n \n   A protein on a cancer cell that is not on normal cells\n \n   A protein that is mutated (changed) in some way on a cancer cell\n \n   Gene (DNA) changes that aren't in a normal cell. \n \n  \n \n  \n   \n  The action of targeted drugs can work to:\n \n   \n    that tell the cancer cell to grow and divide\n \n    within the cancer cells so the cells die\n \n    to feed the cancer cells\n \n    to kill the cancer cells\n \n    to kill them, but not normal cells\n \n  \n \n  The action of the drugs can affect where these drugs work and what side effects they cause.\n \n  It's important to note that some targeted therapy drugs, for example, monoclonal antibodies, work in more than one way to control cancer cells and may also be considered immunotherapy because they boost the immune system.\n  \n  Targeted therapy as precision medicine\n \n  Targeted therapy is sometimes called precision medicine\n or personalized medicine\n. This is because they are made to exactly target specific changes or substances in cancer cells, and these targets can be different even when people have the same type of cancer. Certain types of tumors are tested for different targets after a biopsy or surgery, and this can help find the most effective treatment. Finding a specific target makes matching patients with treatment more precise or personalized.\n \n  Some targeted drugs are more “targeted” than others. Targeted therapies are classified as either ﻿small or large molecule drugs. \n \n   \n    are tiny enough to enter a cancer cell once they find it. They work by targeting a specific substance inside the cell and blocking it.\n \n    usually can't fit into a cell. They work by attacking then weakening or destroying proteins or enzymes on the surface of the cell. They are often described as a \"lock and key\" because the molecule is like a key that opens the enzyme or protein on the surface of the cell like a lock. The key fits into the lock, allowing the drug to work. \n \n  \n \n  Types of targeted therapy\n \n  Many kinds of cancer can be treated with targeted therapies, and there are many different types of targeted therapies. Here are some types with a few examples of how they are used. \n \n   \n    These block the formation of new blood vessels that feed and nourish the cancer cells. Example: bevacizumab (many different cancers). \n \n    These might deliver molecules by themselves or molecules with drugs into or onto the cancer cell to kill it. Examples: alemtuzumab (certain chronic leukemias), trastuzumab (certain breast cancers), cetuximab (certain colorectal, lung, head and neck cancers). NOTE: Some monoclonal antibodies are referred to as targeted therapy because they have a specific target on a cancer cell that they aim to find, attach to, and attack. But other monoclonal antibodies act like immunotherapy because they make the immune system respond better to allow the body to find and attack cancer cells more effectively.\n \n    These disrupt normal cell functions so the cancer cells die. Example: bortezomib (multiple myeloma) \n \n    These disrupt cell signals so that they change the actions of the cancer cell. Example: imatinib (certain chronic leukemias)\n"

        "text": "Getting Targeted Cancer Therapy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n \n       \n  \nThere are also other drugs that are used to treat cancer in different ways, including ﻿chemotherapy, hormone therapy, and immunotherapy.\n \n  Getting IV Targeted Therapy\n \n  Some targeted therapies are given as an infusion. Intravenous or IV chemo is put right into your bloodstream through a tiny, soft, plastic tube called a catheter\n. A needle is used to put the catheter into a vein in your forearm or hand; then the needle is taken out, leaving the catheter behind. Some patients may have a central venous catheter (CVC) or port placed that allows treatment to be given through the same line each time. It stays in as long as you’re getting treatment so you won’t need to be stuck with a needle each time. Different kinds of CVCs are available.\n \n  Intravenous drugs are given in these ways:\n \n   \n    the drugs can be given quickly through the catheter right from a syringe over a few minutes.\n \n    a typical infusion can last from a few minutes to a few hours. A mixed drug solution flows from a plastic bag through tubing that’s attached to the catheter. The flow is usually controlled by a machine called an IV pump. \n \n  \n \n  Getting Oral Targeted Therapy\n \n  If a targeted therapy drug is taken by mouth, you swallow the pill, capsule, or liquid just like other medicines. Oral targeted therapy is usually taken at home. Because of this, it’s very important to make sure you know exactly how it should be taken. If you and your doctor have decided oral chemo is the best treatment option for you, be sure to ask questions and get instructions about:\n \n   \n    You should have clear instructions on how much and when to take your treatment. You need to take the exact dosage, at the exact right time, for exactly as long as you’re supposed to do so. Oral doses are set up so that the same level of drug stays in your body to target and kill the cancer cells. Not taking your treatment the right way can affect how well it works. Sometimes dose changes are needed, but don’t make any changes unless your doctor tells you to do so. If you miss a dose or are late taking one, tell your doctor or nurse about it. They need to know about this when deciding if treatment is working. It may also help the doctor decide whether to change how much of the medicine you take or when you take it.\n \n   . Not a lot is known about long-term effects of certain targeted therapies that might make special handling needed. But many experts recommend taking precautions just in case. To learn more, see ﻿Targeted Therapy Safety.\n \n    Oral anti-cancer drugs can be expensive. Make sure you ask your doctor about the cost of your treatment so you are not surprised when you get to the pharmacy or when you get your bill if the treatment is not available at pharmacies. Depending on the type of drug, some insurances don't cover the full cost, or may not cover it at all. Sometimes you can get assistance but many people have to pay more of their own money for them than what they would pay for treatment that’s given with a needle in the hospital or clinic. If you have health insurance, this might mean a higher co-pay. Make sure you know how much you’ll have to pay for each treatment. You can call the American Cancer Society at 1-800-227-2345 for more information about financial assistance.\n \n  \n \n  Be sure to tell your doctor or nurse about any problems you have taking your oral treatment at home. For instance, if you’re throwing up or feel sick to your stomach, you might feel too sick to take your treatment. Or, you might not be able to keep your treatment pill down and could throw it up. Your doctor needs to know about any problems so they can change your treatment plan, if needed.\n \n  Do I need to protect others from exposure to my targeted drug?\n \n  Much is known about the need to protect others from exposure to traditional or standard chemotherapy because it is hazardous. However, because targeted therapy drugs are newer, there is not as much information about long-term effects of exposure. To be safe, many experts recommend treating targeted therapy drugs as hazardous and taking the same precautions. To learn more read Targeted Therapy Safety. \n"

        "text": "Targeted therapy is a type of ovarian cancer treatment that uses drugs to identify specific and unique features of cancer cells to attack them. It does this without causing much damage to healthy normal cells. Your doctor may use it as a standalone therapy or along with other cancer treatments like surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation therapy.\nHow Does Targeted Therapy Work?\nWhen changes affect the genes in your cells, they tend to behave differently compared with healthy, normal cells. The changes can cause the cells to divide, multiply quickly, grow rapidly, repair themselves, and even interact or communicate with other cells to do similar things. This is what makes a cell “cancerous.”\nBut research shows that not all cancer cells are the same. For example, even if you and many others have the same type of cancer, the gene changes that happen in each person’s cancer cells may be different. They can produce unique proteins or enzymes that tell the cancer cell how it should copy itself and grow in your body.\n This is where targeted therapy comes in. It’s designed to “target” certain cancer cells, take control, attack, and destroy them.\nThe drugs are built to know and target cells if they have:\nToo much of a certain type of protein on a cancer cell\nA type of protein that other normal cells don’t have\nMutated proteins on the cancer cell\nGenetic changes in the makeup of the DNA that doesn’t show up on normal cells\nWhen the drugs do find the cells they’re targeting, they work to:\nBlock or turn off chemical signals that tell cancer cells to multiply\nChange proteins within the cancer cells. This kills them.\nStop making new blood vessels to feed the cancer cells\nMake your immune system attack and kill the cancer cells\nDeliver toxins to cancer cells to kill them but leave normal cells alone\nTargeted therapy drugs, unlike chemo that kills existing cancer cells, can stop new ones from forming in your body.\nRight now, this therapy is used to treat several types of cancer including ovarian cancer. But as experts learn more about cancer cell behavior, more drugs may become available.\nRelated Article\nTargeted Therapy Drugs\nDepending on the type of drug, your doctor may give it to you through your veins (you may hear it called an intravenous or IV drug) or as pills that you take by mouth.\nDifferent types of targeted therapy drugs and their uses include:\n This drug is part of a class of targeted therapy drugs called angiogenesis inhibitors. In order for cancerous cells to divide and multiple, they form new blood vessels to feed off of and grow. This is called angiogenesis.\nBevacizumab targets a protein called VEGF that triggers new blood vessels to form to feed the tumor. The drug helps slow, stop, or shrink the cancer growth. It works well for advanced epithelial ovarian cancer. You get bevacizumab as an IV infusion every 2 to 3 weeks.\nExperts say bevacizumab works well when paired with chemotherapy. The duo can shrink or stop tumor growth. You might get bevacizumab along with other targeted therapy drugs if you have the BRCA gene, which can boost your chances of getting breast or ovarian cancer.\nRelated Article\n The BRCA1 and BRCA 2 genes also play a role in repairing cell DNA. But if you have the mutated version of this gene, you’re more likely to get ovarian cancer. If you do have it, the PARP inhibitors target the mutated cells and block the DNA repair which makes it hard for your tumor or cancer cells to grow.\nPARP inhibitor drugs include:\nNiraparib (Zejula)\nOlaparib (Lynparza)\nRucaparib (Rubraca)\nYou’ll take these drugs by mouth as pills or capsules. However, the type of PARP inhibitor your doctor prescribes depends on whether you have a mutated BRCA gene or not. If you’re not sure you have one, the doctor can check for it by testing your blood, saliva, or tumor.\nThese targeted drugs have been shown to shrink, slow, or stop the growth of tumors in some advanced ovarian cancers.\nDepending on how you respond to your cancer treatment and the stage of your cancer, the doctor may choose a specific PARP inhibitor that you can get:\nAlongside chemotherapy\nWith bevacizumab\nAfter they’ve tried several types and rounds of chemotherapy\nIf your ovarian cancer comes back 6 months after your last chemo\nRelated Article\nTargeted Drugs for NTRK Gene Changes\nA few people with ovarian cancer may have cells with mutations in the NTRK gene (neurotrophic tyrosine receptor kinase). This produces a protein called TRK that can cause abnormal growth in cancer cells.\nEntrectinib (Rozlytrek) and larotrectinib (Vitrakvi) are two types of targeted therapy drugs used to stop or block the TRK protein. These are pills you take by mouth one or two times a day. These drugs aren’t used that often -- your doctor may look into them if you have an advanced type of ovarian cancer with NTRK gene changes and you don’t respond well to other types of treatments.\nSide effectsof these drugs can include:\nDizziness\nTiredness\nNausea\nVomiting\nDiarrhea\nSide effects like heart problems, confusion, or abnormal liver tests are less common but may happen.\nThings to Keep in Mind\nIt’s important to take the targeted therapy drugs exactly as your doctor prescribes them. If you’re unsure, ask the doctor for instructions. Taking them correctly can affect how well they work to target cancer cells and kill them.\nIf you have any issues taking oral anti-cancer pills or capsules at home or notice a reaction, tell your doctor or cancer care team as soon as possible.\nIf you’re feeling sick from your cancer treatments and you can’t keep the pill down because of nausea, let your doctor know before you stop taking it or miss a dose. They may be able to switch or change up your treatment plan or dosage to find out what works best for you.\n"

The approval covers the use of olaparib in combination with bevacizumab (Avastin) in women whose tumors shrink partially or completely after initial treatment with chemotherapy containing a platinum drug. In addition, the olaparib–bevacizumab treatment can be used only to treat women who have certain genetic alterations. These alterations must be determined using a specific FDA-approved test, the agency explained in a statement. The approval was based on findings from the PAOLA-1 trial, results of which are described in this Cancer Currents\n story.\n\n      Drugs known as PARP inhibitors are used to treat some women with advanced ovarian cancer that has returned after earlier treatment. Now, results from three new clinical trials show that the drugs might also benefit women who are newly diagnosed with advanced ovarian cancer.\n\n\nThe studies—which tested the PARP inhibitors niraparib (Zejula), olaparib (Lynparza), and veliparib, respectively—involved women with high-grade serous epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer.\n\n\nStandard initial treatment for women with newly diagnosed advanced ovarian cancer typically includes first-line therapy with a combination of surgery and chemotherapy, sometimes followed by maintenance therapy—an additional treatment intended to help prevent the cancer from coming back. But for most patients, the cancer still returns within 3 years of initial treatment.\n\n\nIn all three studies, the use of a PARP inhibitor as first-line therapy, maintenance therapy, or both substantially delayed the length of time before participants’ cancers came back or got worse. Results from all three trials were presented recently at the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Congress 2019 in Barcelona, Spain.\n\n\n“After decades studying different chemotherapy approaches, it is the first time we have meaningfully prolonged progression-free survival and hopefully we will improve long-term outcome,” Ana Oaknin, M.D., of Vall d' Hebron Institute of Oncology in Barcelona, an investigator on one of the trials, said in a news release.\n\n\nChristina Annunziata, M.D., Ph.D., of the Women’s Malignancies Branch in NCI's Center for Cancer Research, who was not involved in the studies, said that these results are exciting, but she noted that differences among the study designs and outcomes raises questions about how best to incorporate the different PARP inhibitors into treatment strategies for women with ovarian cancer.\n\n\nExperts are currently working together to draft new guidelines for ovarian cancer treatment, Dr. Annunziata added. \n\n\nThe Trouble with DNA Repair\n\n\nOne in three women with ovarian cancer has tumors that are unable to repair a certain kind of DNA damage. Harmful mutations in theBRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, for example, lead to faulty DNA repair.\n\n\nTumors that lack this crucial DNA repair ability are called homologous recombination deficient, or HRD. HRD is defined as the presence of a harmful BRCA\n mutation or a certain score on a molecular test.\n\n\nIn 2018, a landmark clinical trial showed that maintenance therapy with the PARP inhibitor olaparib benefitted women with ovarian cancer that had a harmful BRCA \nmutation.\n\n\nSince then, doctors questioned whether PARP inhibitors also benefit the larger group of women with HRD tumors and women with ovarian tumors that are not HRD. The three new clinical trials begin to address these questions.\n\n\nPRIMA: Niraparib as Maintenance Therapy\n\n\nIn one of the new trials, an international trial called PRIMA, the PARP inhibitor niraparib was evaluated as maintenance therapy for women with newly diagnosed ovarian cancer. The trial was sponsored by GlaxoSmithKline, the manufacturer of niraparib.\n\n\nMore than 700 women whose tumors had responded to first-line chemotherapy were randomly assigned to receive niraparib or a placebo. Half of the women had HRD tumors. \n\n\nOverall, niraparib increased the median length of time women lived without their cancer getting worse or coming back (median progression-free survival, the trial’s primary endpoint) by about 6 months compared with placebo (14 months versus 8 months). \n\n\nIt is important to note that the overall group included women with a high risk of recurrence—those with very advanced cancer and those whose tumors could not be fully removed by surgery—making it more representative of a real-world setting, Dr. Annunziata said.\n\n\nThe improvement in progression-free survival was even more striking for women with HRD tumors. For these women, median progression-free survival was 22 months in the niraparib group and 10 months in the placebo group.\n\n\nAnd for women whose tumors were not HRD, niraparib improved median progression-free survival by about 3 months (8 months versus 5 months). \n\n\nPARP inhibitors can affect blood cells, and the most common serious side effects of niraparib were lower than normal levels of red blood cells (anemia), platelets (thrombocytopenia), and white blood cells (neutropenia).\n\n\nFindings from the PRIMA trial were published September 28 in the New England Journal of Medicine\n.\n\n\nNiraparib was recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for a slightly different setting. The indication is for women with advanced ovarian cancer that is HRD and who have received at least three or more lines of chemotherapy. FDA also approved a test for HRD tumors, called myChoice CDxm, which is manufactured by Myriad Genetics.\n\n\nPAOLA-1: Olaparib Plus Bevacizumab as Maintenance Therapy\n\n\nWomen with advanced ovarian cancer have two FDA-approved options for maintenance therapy after first-line treatment. Olaparib is approved for women whose tumors have a harmful BRCA\n mutation, whereas the other drug, bevacizumab (Avastin), is approved for all women regardless of their BRCA\n mutation status.\n\n\nAnother new trial, called PAOLA-1, tested the combination of bevacizumab plus olaparib as maintenance therapy. More than 800 women with advanced ovarian cancer whose tumors shrank either completely or partially in response to first-line therapy were randomly assigned to receive maintenance therapy with bevacizumab plus either olaparib or a placebo.\n\n\nAmong all of the women in the study, treatment with bevacizumab plus olaparib improved median progression-free survival by about 5 monthsExit Disclaimer compared with bevacizumab plus placebo (22 months versus 17 months).\n\n\nAs with the PRIMA study, patients with HRD tumors appeared to have the greatest benefit. Among these women, median progression-free survival was 19 months longer in the olaparib group than the placebo group (37 months versus 18 months).\n\n\nOn the other hand, there was no difference in median progression-free survival between the olaparib and placebo groups among women whose tumors were not HRD.\n\n\nHowever, study investigator Nicoletta Colombo, M.D., of the University of Milan-Bicocca, said at the conference, “I wouldn’t exclude patients with a negative HRD test” because “the benefit was confirmed in the overall population,” the trial's primary endpoint.\n\n\nPatients in both groups reported similar rates of severe side effects, the most common of which were high blood pressure and anemia. In the olaparib group, 20% of patients discontinued the treatment due to toxicity.\n\n\nThat the combination of bevacizumab and olaparib improves outcomes is an exciting finding, Dr. Annunziata said. “In the past, we had to choose between olaparib for BRCA\n mutation carriers or bevacizumab for nonmutation carriers,” she said, implying that it might be possible to combine both options.\n\n\nVELIA: Veliparib as First-Line and Maintenance Therapy\n\n\nThe VELIA trial took a slightly different approach, testing veliparib as part of first-line treatment and as maintenance therapy. AbbVie, the manufacturer of veliparib, sponsored the international trial. The findings were published September 28 in the New England Journal of Medicine\n.\n\n\nMore than 1,000 women with newly diagnosed advanced ovarian cancer were randomly assigned to receive chemotherapy plus either a placebo or veliparib as first-line treatment followed by either placebo or veliparib as maintenance therapy.\n\n\nOutcomes of the veliparib-throughout group (those who received veliparib during first-line and maintenance therapy) were compared with outcomes of the control group (those who received placebo during first-line and maintenance therapy).\n\n\nOverall, veliparib extended the median progression-free survival by about 7 months (24 months versus 17 months). For women with HRD tumors, median progression-free survival was 11 months longer in the veliparib-throughout group than in the control group (32 months versus 21 months). \n\n\nThe benefit was even more striking among women with harmful BRCA\n mutations. For these women, median progression-free survival was 35 months in the veliparib-throughout group and 22 months in the control group.\n\n\nThe most common side effect reported by patients in the veliparib-throughout group was nausea. These patients also had higher rates of thrombocytopenia than those in the control group. Nineteen percent of people in the veliparib-throughout group discontinued veliparib during the maintenance phase due to side effects.\n\n\nWho Should Get PARP Inhibitors for Initial Treatment?\n\n\nThe three new studies show that, in addition to women with BRCA\n-mutated tumors, initial treatment with PARP inhibitors “also benefits the larger HRD population, which is a major step forward,” said Daniela Matei, M.D., a medical oncologist at Northwestern University in Chicago, who wasn’t involved in the studies.\n\n\nGiven that none of the three regimens are currently indicated by FDA for women with newly diagnosed ovarian cancer, it is difficult to predict how physicians might choose between them, Dr. Matei noted. However, doctors may be less likely to choose veliparib because it is a newer drug and they have less experience with it, she added.\n\n\nAs for women whose tumors are not HRD, the impact of initial treatment with a PARP inhibitor is unclear. Outcomes for this group of women differed among the trials, and because none of the studies were designed to specifically analyze outcomes for this group of women, those findings are “not really definitive,” Dr. Annunziata explained.\n\n\nSo right now, it isn’t clear whether initial treatment with a PARP inhibitor should be recommended for all women, or only those with HRD tumors, she said. Although tests for BRCA\n mutations are part of standard care, HRD tests are not yet mainstream.\n\n\nAnother important question, said Dr. Matei, is what treatments will work for patients whose disease returns or who don’t respond to initial treatment with PARP inhibitors?\n",

This study provides insights into both how the cancers resist treatments, and which patients may respond favorably to the drug, said lead author Dr. Elizabeth Swisher, a UW Medicine gynecologic oncologist and a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Washington School of Medicine. She also co-directs the Breast and Ovarian Cancer Research Program at the Seattle Cancer Care Alliance.\nThe paper represents collaborative work of researchers in 75 universities and focuses on treatments of 493 patients between April 2013 and October 2016.\n“PARP inhibitors are a drug class that has become an important therapeutic for ovarian and some other cancers. This study looked at pretreatment biopsies to define predictors of response to treatment and mechanisms of resistance (within the cancer cells), which is critical to understanding best use of these therapies,” Swisher said.\nThe best responders included those patients with ovarian cancer associated with inherited or somatic (not inherited) mutations in the ovarian cancer susceptibility genes BRCA1, BRCA2, RAD51C and RAD51D, all genes involved in DNA repair, Swisher noted.\n“PARP inhibitors target the Achilles heel of cancers which have certain types of defects in DNA repair,” she said.\nThe study found that cancers exposed to previous platinum chemotherapy have built up resistance by improving their DNA repair capabilities, which then creates cross-resistance to rucaparib. This explains why PARP inhibitors work better earlier in the course of treatment, Swisher said.\nThe researchers correlated many molecular alterations to response to treatment including inherited and somatic mutations, methylation alterations (epigenetic changes) and genomic scars (mutational patterns created by defective DNA repair).\nThe authors defined which mutation and methylation events correlated with response to rucaparib.\nBut in patients who had received previous chemotherapy, cancers had developed a resistance to  rucaparib.\nFunding is from the National Breast Cancer Foundation of Australia  and the Department of Defense Ovarian Cancer Research Program (OC12056) and a Stand Up To Cancer-Ovarian Cancer Research Fund Alliance-National Ovarian Cancer Coalition Dream Team Translational Cancer Research Grant (SU2C-AACR-DT16-15)\n",

        "text": "Experts in Ovarian Cancer Discuss Targeted Agent Combinations and Disparities in Care\nDylann Cohn-Emery\n, May 2021, Volume 10,  Issue 7\nThe ovarian cancer treatmentlandscape, including the use of cytotoxic and targeted therapies, is continuously evolving for patients. Although the standard of care in the front-line treatment of advanced ovarian cancer is a combination of chemotherapy and surgery, recent trials have evaluated PARP inhibitors, antiangiogenic agents, and other targeted therapies. Investigators are looking at strategies to individualize care, not only to find the best treatment practices but also to ensure all patients receive the care they need regardless of where they live or their financial status.\nThe ongoing research in this setting is encouraging because ovarian cancer is the fifth-ranking cancer for number of deaths among women, with an estimated 13,770 who will die from the disease in 2021 in the United States. Approximately 21,410 women will receive an ovarian cancer diagnosis in 2021. Although the disease mainly develops in women over the age of 50 years, it can affect women of any age.\n“The most common type of ovarian cancer, serious carcinoma, more commonly affects women in their 50s and 60s, but that is not to say that does not affect young women who are in their reproductive years or women who are already mothers into their older years,” Erin E. Medlin, MD, a clinical physician at Penn Medicine Lancaster General Health in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, said in an interview with Targeted Oncology.\n“About 25% of all ovarian cancers are going to be caused by an inherited genetic mutation, meaning patients inherit something in their DNA from 1 or both parents that puts them at an increased risk for developing ovarian cancer, in addition to other cancers,” Joshua P. Kesterson, MD, a gynecologic oncologist and chief of the Division of Gynecologic Oncology at Penn State Health Milton S. Hershey Medical Center in Hershey, Pennsylvania, told Targeted Oncology.\nBRCA\n mutations are one of the most common genetic aberrations that can be passed down to daughters or sons of BRCA\n-mutation carriers. The standard in this setting is to test all women with newly diagnosed ovarian cancer for BRCA\n or other inherited mutations, “with genetic counseling and genetic testing, blood or saliva is used to [discover] what’s going on at a DNA level,” according to Kesterson.\nOlaparib (Lynparza) plus bevacizumab (Avastin), olaparib plus rucaparib (Rubraca), or olaparib as monotherapy can be used for patients withBRCA mutationsafter chemotherapy. Niraparib (Zejula) can be used as maintenance after platinum chemotherapy or after several lines of chemotherapy.\nWhile ovarian cancer most often affects post-menopausal women, young women interested in preserving their fertility options may also be affected.\n“In terms of how we see therapies related to fertility, carboplatin-based therapies for women who are able to preserve fertility have little effect on the long-term reproductive outcomes,” Medlin said.\nSeveral trials have examined the preservation of fertility. One of those was ended early because the treatment of oocyte vitrification, or freezing the patients’ retrieved oocytes through vitrification, was deemed a standard of care before the trial finished (NCT01268592).\n“Some women who have an early-stage ovarian cancer will be candidates for fertility- preserving surgery, meaning that they’re able to keep their uterus and ovary. If that is something that could be considered, they should talk to their provider,” Medlin said.\nInvestigators are looking into how to individualize care for these patients. At present, the surrogate biomarker used most often is platinum sensitivity; however, identifying more biomarkers, and targeted agents for those biomarkers, will be beneficial to this setting.\n“Something that I think will probably come first and what has been the trend within trials is [that investigators will] look first in the recurrent setting,” Medlin said. “[In other words, they will be] looking at women who have platinum-sensitive recurrence and instead of getting a platinum- or carboplatin-based therapy, swapping that out for a PARP inhibitor or another targeted agent and comparing that with chemotherapy. [Investigators are] trying to understand if we could give a PARP inhibitor or a more targeted therapy in this setting as opposed to chemotherapy, which has less toxicity or [fewer] adverse effects.”\nImmunotherapy is also undergoing evaluation. Although it hasn’t shown much efficacy as a single-line treatment, immunotherapy is now being investigated in combination with chemotherapy. One such trial is looking at pembrolizumab (Keytruda) plus cisplatin and rintatolimod in patients with recurrent ovarian cancer (NCT03734692). This regimen is a combination of systemic immune checkpoint blockade and intraperitoneal chemoimmunotherapy.\n“The peritoneal cavity is where these tumors often present and recur. So we need to treat locally but do so with the benefit of not just traditional cytotoxic agents, but also inducing an immune response or immune-modulating agent locally. I think that’s incredibly exciting,” Kesterson said. He believes this strategy of treating patients could lead to a potential paradigm shift.\nInvestigators are also studying chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells to see how well they will work in ovarian cancer. “Those trials are undergoing intense scrutiny as well,” Medlin said. Investigators in 1 trial, which is based in China, are studying mesothelin (MESO)-CAR T-cell therapy in patients with relapsed or refractory disease (NCT03799913). This early phase 1 trial is still actively recruiting patients to receive anti–MESO-CAR T cells, fludarabine, and cyclophosphamide.\nAntifolate antibody therapy, antibody-drug conjugates, and hormonal therapy are other possibilities in different types of ovarian cancer and are undergoing research in this setting. Beyond the newer therapies being investigated, another important aspect is determining the optimal sequence of therapies to provide the best quality of life, as well as the longest survival rate possible.\n“Speaking to quality of life, I think we have an increased appreciation of the need to truly monitor the patient-reported outcomes beyond that metric of just progression-free survival and overall survival. Although [those are] incredibly impactful and appreciated from a clinical trial and efficacy standpoint, what we need to do is individualize that care so we can align patient expectations with physician expectations to choose the ideal regimen for these women,” Kesterson explained.\nFinding the best sequence of treatment will be beneficial, especially for patients who have progressed on platinum chemotherapy, who Medlin believes have an unmet need in this space. “Once patients progress, they tend to cycle through treatment options and continue to fail next-line therapies,” she said. To find an appropriate treatment beyond chemotherapy, she suggests exploring possibilities such as precision medicine, using molecular testing to find biomarkers, getting more up-to-date biopsy samples, or using artificial intelligence technology.\n“Potentially, artificial intelligence [could] take all that information from patients and help the clinician find the drug that’s going to be most helpful to them. I think we’ll continue to build it in that space as these more targeted therapeutics come out, [and figure out] how we can get all these patient data and funnel them into the correct choice as the next line for the patient, Medlin said.\nAt the annual SGO meeting in March, results were presented from multiple studies on different therapies that may be used to treat patients with ovarian cancer and potentially change the standard of care in this setting.\n“I think there’s some incredibly clinically relevant data…coming out regarding the use of PARP inhibition in the recurrent setting. [It’s] showing some impressive efficacy, even in those who had platinum-sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer, who are BRCA\n mutated, or who were treated with either a PARP inhibitor or with a platinum-based regimen,” Kesterson said. “Those treated with PARP inhibitors did exceedingly well; that rivaled, if not surpassed, the benefit from an outcomes perspective as well as from an adverse effect perspective, when compared with our standard of treating this platinum-sensitive patient with a platinum-based doublet in a recurrent setting.”\nOne trial whose results showed significant improvement among patients in progression-free survival and duration of response was the multicenter, randomized, phase 3 ARIEL4 study (NCT02855944). When compared with standard-of-care chemotherapy, rucaparib demonstrated better efficacy for patients with BRCA\n-mutated advanced, relapsed ovarian cancer (HR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.49-0.84; P\n= .001). “Instead of getting the third platinum therapy, they received a PARP inhibitor…. Those patients did as well or better than the chemotherapy arm. [These agents] were directly compared so it does appear they are able to be swapped out. I anticipate they’ll gain approval for that in this setting, and we’ll continue to see that shift [going] forward,” Medlin said.\nOther findings presented at SGO, from the phase 2 OPAL study (NCT03574779), showed that adding dostarlimab, an investigational anti–PD-1 agent, to niraparib and bevacizumab for patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer produced positive antitumor activity. In this trial, investigators looked at the combination in 39 evaluable patients, 17.9% of whom had an objective response (90% CI, 8.7%-31.1%); 7 patients had partial responses. Twenty-three patients had stable disease and there was an overall disease control rate of 76.9% (90% CI, 63.2%-87.4%).\n“I think there are some interesting data out there looking at the targeted therapies, as well as exploring the role of the immune system, which we know to be incredibly impactful on patient outcomes and disease markers and prognosis,” Kesterson noted. “Finding ways to augment the immune system to make the tumors more recognizable, …whether it be in a systemic fashion or a localized fashion, has been incredibly interesting. The data are quite riveting and warrant further study in larger patient populations.”\nIn Kesterson’s view, the SGO has made an active effort to address differences in care and how the oncology community can do better at offering the standard of care to a larger range of patients. This includes those “from diverse backgrounds, ethnicities, and locations, so that we can standardize care for all and try to elevate not just the care for an individual woman but for women in general.”\n“There’s incredibly meaningful and impactful progress…being made,” Kesterson continued. “I think SGO, and we as members of SGO, appreciate that there’s a need to make sure that care is delivered to all, regardless of background, location, or other factors that may previously have resulted in them receiving what we call substandard care.”\nThis year’s SGO meeting featured an education forum titled “Eradicating Racism and Discrimination in Medicine.” The presentations covered the historical effects of racism on the current practices used in oncology and cancer-specific statistics; how unconscious bias affects patient care and how care providers can combat their biases; and racism in academia and diversifying workforces.\nKeely Ulmer, MD, retrospectively looked at disparities in ovarian cancer survival rates for patients in urban settings versus patients in rural settings. In their poster, Ulmer and colleagues showed that women in rural areas are at significantly greater risk of poorer overall outcomes. In Kesterson’s words: “We need to do a good job of taking care of not just women…living in a bigger city who may have access to a tertiary or a large medical center, but…of all women, regardless of location, …socioeconomic status, or demographic background.”\nAccording to Medlin, giving all women access to cutting-edge treatment, ensuring that treatment is cost effective, and finding a way to make care cheaper without sacrificing its quality are currently the most important unmet needs in this space.\nEnrolling a more diverse range of patients in clinical trials is also a prevalent topic. Medlin believes investigators and physicians should be “making sure that not just the wealthy and well connected have access to trials but that all women have access to clinical trials, so they have access to these up-and-coming treatments and know about them and are able to get [transportation] there.”\nDespite the unmet needs that remain, care providers are working on ways to ensure better, more encompassing care for patients with ovarian cancer.\n“In terms of looking at women across the globe and across the age spectrum, ovarian cancer has a lot of adverse effects. [There’s] a lot of hardship in terms of getting through treatment, and [the cancer] often will recur,” Medlin said. “[It] may be a lifelong journey that women are on in terms of therapy, [which] can impact their ability to see their loved ones or participate in activities that they love.\n“We are constantly looking at how we can make women’s lives better, how they can continue to do the activities they love and be with the people they love, and ultimately get them more quality time with their families and their loved ones,” Medlin concluded.\n"

Dizon, MD, of the Lifespan Cancer Institute at Rhode Island Hospital in Providence.\nCurrent non-platinum, single-agent options for such patients include weekly paclitaxel, pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD, Doxil), gemcitabine, or topotecan, often in combination with the antiangiogenic agent bevacizumab (Avastin).\nOverall response rates (ORRs) with non-platinum single-agent therapy are similar and range from 10-15%, with a progression-free survival (PFS) of 3 to 4 months and an overall survival (OS) of approximately 12 months.\nResults from the phase III AURELIA study, led by Pujade-Lauraine, showed that PFS almost doubled, from 3.4 to 6.7 months, when bevacizumab was added to single-agent chemotherapy (hazard ratio 0.48, 95% CI 0.38-0.60, P\n<0.001). However, the addition of bevacizumab only showed a trend toward improved OS (16.6 vs 13.3 months; P\n=0.171).\nMore recently, the phase III JAVELIN Ovarian 200 study, also led by Pujade-Lauraine, failed to demonstrate improved survival outcomes in 566 platinum-resistant or refractory ovarian cancer patients treated with the PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitor avelumab (Bavencio) alone or in combination with PLD, versus PLD alone. In the intent-to-treat population, median PFS was 3.7 months with the combination versus 3.5 months with PLD alone. Similarly, OS was 15.7 months versus 13.1 months, respectively.\n\"The heterogeneity and marked adaptability of the cancer genome, particularly in [high-grade serous ovarian cancer], indicate that overcoming resistance to therapy will require many different approaches,\" Pujade-Lauraine and colleagues wrote. \"In this regard, increased knowledge of the ovarian cancer driver events will be key for the new therapy developments in the future.\"\nThe reviewers noted that the phase II QUADRA trial of single-agent niraparib (Zejula), a poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor, provided evidence of activity in patients with platinum-resistant disease and both germline and somatic BRCA mutations. All patients had received three or more previous lines of therapy.\nThe ORR was 33% following treatment in 21 patients with platinum-resistant disease and 19% in 16 patients with platinum-refractory disease. The median duration of response was 9.2 months.\n\n                    Medical News from Around the Web\nJAMA\n1\nEffect of Physiologic Point-of-Care Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation Training on Survival With Favorable Neurologic Outcome in Cardiac Arrest in Pediatric ICUs: A Randomized Clinical Trial.\nJ Clin Oncol\n2\nDeterminants of Neutralizing Antibody Response After SARS CoV-2 Vaccination in Patients With Myeloma.\nJ Clin Oncol\n3\nLung Cancer Diagnosed Through Screening, Lung Nodule, and Neither Program: A Prospective Observational Study of the Detecting Early Lung Cancer (DELUGE) in the Mississippi Delta Cohort.\nDespite limited treatment and survival outcomes that are \"completely underwhelming,\" there is good news, Thomas Herzog, MD, of the University of Cincinnati Cancer Institute, told MedPage Today\n.\n\"Platinum-resistant disease has become the focus of novel developmental therapeutics with new approaches and compounds vying for regulatory accelerated approval,\" Herzog said. \"During the entirety of my career, I have never seen as much research activity focused on this space with many of these research initiatives driven by biomarker and molecular anti-tumor strategies.\"\nEven the definition of platinum resistance has evolved, Herzog noted. \"Molecular signature, histologic subtype, maintenance-free interval, and lines of therapies often trump or enrich our understanding of the treatment-free interval [TFI] and traditional platinum-free interval [PFI] upon which platinum resistance is defined.\"\nIn clinical practice and in clinical trials, ovarian cancer continues to be categorized as either platinum-sensitive or platinum-resistant using the length of PFI. Temporal reference points include a PFI of less than 1 month, 1 to 6 months, 6 to 12 months, and more than 12 months.\nHowever, an \"important evolution\" in these concepts is underway, Pujade-Lauraine and colleagues confirmed, noting the recent proposal at the fifth Ovarian Cancer Consensus Conference in Tokyo to reflect a wider range of treatments by replacing PFI with TFI. The terms of reference that were delineated included TFI from the last platinum dose as well as TFI from the last non-platinum therapy and TFI from the last biologic agent.\n\"The relevance of this new classification will be explored in the coming years,\" the authors predicted.\nIt has also been suggested that integration of the factors that influence outcome might predict prognosis better than use of PFI alone. In an AURELIA sub-study, for instance, a prognostic nomogram was validated to predict OS in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer.\nPrognostic factors of different weight could also be used to improve algorithms of treatment and new drug evaluation, Pujade-Lauraine and colleagues pointed out. These factors would include the type and number of prior therapies; tumor burden, co-morbidities, and autonomy capacity; and the presence, type, and severity of symptoms at relapse, including ascites, abdominal symptoms, performance status, and pain.\nIn the meantime, enrollment in early-phase trials is often one of the best options for patients whose outcomes remain poor, the review authors emphasized.\nThe ongoing phase III ARIEL4 trial is evaluating single-agent rucaparib (Rubraca) compared with standard chemotherapy in BRCA\n-mutated ovarian cancer. Included are patients with platinum-resistant disease, and the study's primary completion date is June 2022.\nAnother ongoing phase III trial is looking at the use of olaparib (Lynparza) combined with the oral vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitor cediranib (AZD2171) in patients with resistant disease, regardless of BRCA\n status; the estimated primary completion date is June 2023.\n\n                \n            \n                                                \n                                                    \n                                \n                            \n\n                                                \n                            Kristin Jenkins has been a regular contributor to MedPage Today and a columnist for Reading Room, since 2015.  \n\n                        \n\n                    \n\n                                        \n\n        \n\n                \n                            \n                    Disclosures\n\n                    Pujade-Lauraine disclosed relationships with AstraZeneca, Tesaro, Roche, Clovis Oncology, Pfizer, EMD Serono, Merck, Incyte, and Arcagy Research.\n\n                \n\n                                                        \n                    Primary Source\n\n                    Journal of Clinical Oncology\n\n                    Source Reference: Pujade-Lauraine E, et al \"Management of Platinum-Resistant, Relapsed Epithelial Ovarian Cancer and New Drug Perspectives\" J Clin Oncol 2019; 37(27): 2437-2448.",

        "text": "Treatment Options Abound in Platinum-Sensitive Ovarian Cancer\nConference | \nIn ovarian cancer, disease that returns within 6 months of treatment following platinum-based therapy is defined as platinum-sensitive.\nBobbie J. Rimel, MD\nIn ovarian cancer, disease that returns within 6 months of treatment following platinum-based therapy is defined as platinum-sensitive. A patient’s platinum-sensitivity status can change with minor decisions made in clinical practice; however, oncologists treating these patients have a variety of therapeutics available to choose from, Bobbie J. Rimel, MD, said during a presentation at the 2020 SGO Winter Meeting.\nRimel, an assistant professor of gynecology and obstetrics at Samuel Oschin Comprehensive Cancer Institute, said that early studies by Maurie Markman, MD, helped elucidate platinum-sensitivity in ovarian cancer. Study investigators had looked at how patient response to treatment changes over time, she said. When they went back to perform secondary cytoreduction, a practice which has since fallen out of favor, they found that the vast majority of patients still had tumors.\nTherefore, platinum-sensitivity is a function of time. “Time must pass for your patient to have platinum-sensitive disease,” Rimel said. “It doesn't just mean that the patient responded.”\nThe typical course of therapy means that patient shows a first response to first-line treatment, then the physician follows up with CA-125 or radiographic imaging. Current guidelines do not establish when to perform these tests, and Rimel said that the definition of “platinum sensitive” can change based on how often the physician screens for recurrence.\nApproximately 70% to 80% of patients will relapse and receive a second course of treatment that leads to a second response or stability.\nPhysicianstreating patients with platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer can choose from a range of therapies, including doublet chemotherapy with or without bevacizumab (Avastin) and PARP inhibitors, such as rucaparib (Rubraca), niraparib (Zejula) and olaparib (Lynparza).\nSupport for platinum doublet chemotherapygoes as far back as 2010 with the CALYPSO trial, which compared carboplatin and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (CD) versus paclitaxel and carboplatin (CP). The median progression-free survival (PFS) favored the CD arm at 11.3 months versus 9.4 months with CP (HR, 0.821; 95% CI, 0.72-0.94; P\n = .005).\nMore recently, Jacobus Pfisterer, MD, director of the Gynecologic Oncology Center in Kiel, Germany, reported findings from AGO/OVAR 2.21 at the 2018 ESMO Congress. Investigators determined that CD plus bevacizumab showed a superiority in median PFS compared with carboplatin/gemcitabine/bevacizumab (13.3 vs 11.7 months; HR, 0.807; 95% CI, 0.681-0.956; P\n = .0128).\nIn GOG-0213, the addition of bevacizumab to CP resulted in a median PFS of 13.8 months compared with 10.4 months for CP alone (HR, 0.628; 95% CI, 0.53-0.74).\nIn the OCEANS trial, the addition of bevacizumab to carboplatin/gemcitabine resulted in a 4-month improvement in median PFS over carboplatin/gemcitabine alone at 12.4 versus 8.4 months, respectively (HR, 0.484; 95% CI, 0.388-0.605). Furthermore, the GOG-0213 results showed a 5-month overall survival benefit associated with bevacizumab.\nTaken together, findings from these 4 studies show that the addition of bevacizumab to a chemotherapy doublet results in extended PFS.\nNot all patients are eligible for bevacizumab maintenance. Rimmel said PARP inhibitors are a better choice for those with active fistulas or nonhealing wounds, poorly controlled hypertension, and/or proteinuria. Data from 2 studies, Study 19 and SOLO-2, show that olaparib can improve PFS in this population and especially in patients with BRCA\n-mutant disease.\nIn Study 19, patients were assigned to either olaparib at 400 mg twice daily (n = 136) or placebo (n = 129). Eligible patients had platinum-sensitive, relapsed, high-grade serous ovarian cancer who had received ≥2 previous platinum-based regimens and had a partial or complete response to their most recent platinum-based regimen. The median PFS was 8.4 months in the olaparib arm versus 4.8 months for placebo (HR, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.25-0.49; P\n <.001).\nFindings from a prespecified analysis of Study 19 showed that median PFS was significantly longer in the olaparib group among patients with a BRCA\n mutation than in the placebo group (11.2 vs 4.3 months; HR, 0.18; 95% CI, 0.10-0.31; P\n <.0001).\nThe phase III SOLO-2 trial evaluated the benefit of olaparib maintenance therapy in patients with BRCA\n-mutated ovarian cancer. Patients were assigned to 300 mg of twice-daily olaparib (n = 196) or placebo (n = 99).\nResults showed that olaparib was associated with a 70% reduction in the risk for progression or death (HR, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.22-0.41; P\n <.0001). Investigator-assessed median PFS was significantly longer with olaparib than with placebo at 19.1 months and 5.5 months, respectively (HR, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.22-0.41; P\n <.0001).\nMoreover, the phase III ARIEL3 study included patients with platinum-sensitive, high-grade serous or endometrioid ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube carcinoma who had received ≥2 prior platinum-based chemotherapy regimens and had achieved complete or partial response to their last platinum-based regimen. Patients were randomized to receive rucaparib or placebo.\nData demonstrated that, in patients with a BRCA-mutant carcinoma, the median PFS was 16.6 months with rucaparib and 5.4 months with placebo (HR, 0.23; 95% CI, 0.16-0·34]; P\n <.0001). In the intent-to-treat population, the median PFS was 10.8 months versus 5.4 months, respectively (HR, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.30-0.45; P\n <.0001).\nFor platinum-sensitive PARP inhibitor—naïve patients responding to platinum-based therapy, PARP inhibitor maintenance will prolong PFS, Rimel said. “As in the upfront setting, patients with BRCA\n mutations of any kind consistently derive the most PFS benefit in these trials.”\n       \nPujade-Lauraine E, Wagner U, Aavall-Lundqvist E, et al.

What every clinician should know\nThe contemporary management of recurrent ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian cancers has continued to evolve and now offers women the hope of extended survival with an improved quality of life, although cure remains elusive once disease recurs. Unfortunately, up to 70% of patients who originally presented with advanced ovarian cancer will recur.\n\n\nRecurrence of ovarian cancer may occur via a variety of presentations, as disease may be either silent or symptomatic. The confirmation of recurrence is frustrating for patient and physician alike as the response to front-line therapy after initial surgery is often complete, and thus patients are encouraged by the achievement of a complete remission with no evidence of any active disease, only to be disappointed once again.\n\n\t\nAdvertisement\n\n\nGenerally patients are followed every 3 months for the first 2 years and then every 6 months for at least 5 years following the end of initial chemotherapy. While there are established risk factors for recurrence such as stage and grade of tumor, the outcome or prediction of recurrence can not be made with certainty for any single patient. Some patients with apparent good prognosis disease will recur, and some patients with poor prognosis disease will never recur after initial adjuvant treatment. Patients who do not respond to front-line treatment are technically considered to have persistent, not recurrent, disease; yet many of the treatment options are similar for both groups.\nToday’s top picks on the Haymarket Medical Network\nEponyms in Oncology: Hodgkin LymphomaHaymarket MediaMarch 7, 2022\nAdvances Needed to Reduce Overdiagnosis of Breast CancerMark L.

        "text": "2. Diagnosis and differential diagnosis\nDiagnosis of recurrenceis usually based upon developing symptoms or the detection of a rising CA-125 value. When symptoms progress or CA-125 levels increase substantially (at least two times the upper limits of normal), imaging studies are generally ordered. Most common is CT scan, but PET scan alone or preferably with CT as well as MRI or U/S may be preferred in some cases.\n\n\nSome have questioned the value of routinely following CA-125 values as there is one study that has shown that no survival improvement was demonstrated when patients were randomized to withholding CA-125 results and treating only if symptoms occurred thereby triggering imaging versus active treatment of rising values even if the patient has no symptoms or significant disease on imaging studies. In fact, more chemotherapy was administered in the CA-125 knowledgeable group, but quality of life was worse, presumably secondary to side effects from chemotherapy, and survival was not improved. Despite this data, most patients in the U.S. still have CA-125 values checked during surveillance.\n\n\nThe reliability of elevated CA-125 using GCIG criteria reliably predicts recurrent disease in the vast majority of patients. Not all epithelial ovarian cancers express CA-125; thus, this marker is not as effective when not elevated at the time of original diagnosis. It also important to realize that occasionally patients may have a false positive result as a result of poor clearance due to kidney or liver disease or inflammation in the peritoneal cavity that can result in modest rises in markers. Nonetheless, if the trend continues to elevate, the chances of a false positive result diminish precipitously. Other newer markers can also be used, such as HE4 in surveillance for recurrent ovarian cancer.\n\n\nEstablishing recurrent disease is most often via imaging after the patient has increased symptoms such as pain, bloating, early satiety, or change in urinary or bowel habits, or has an elevated serum tumor marker upon routine surveillance. Biopsy is generally not necessary for confirmation unless a patient has had other malignancies or a lesion on scan is not clearly defined. Rising CA-125 values generally pre-date radiographic confirmation by approximately 3 months.\n",

When should therapies be initiated?\nTherapy is generally initiated immediately if imaging shows significant disease, any solid organ involvement or impending bowel obstruction. Otherwise, the timing of initiation of treatment for recurrent ovarian cancer can be individualized.\n\n\nB. What should the therapy for recurrent cancer be?\nTreatment of recurrence must address the goals of extending survival, mitigating symptoms and optimizing quality of life. Treatment of patients with recurrent ovarian cancer has largely been empiric, and there have been limited data available that clearly establishes the preferred choice, combinations and sequence of the ever-expanding array of therapeutic options available. Recent trials and guideline generation have offered clinical guidance for the treatment of recurrent ovarian cancer.\n\n\nCurrent management of recurrent ovarian cancer usually is dictated by the interval of time until recurrence of disease is diagnosed. Patients are classified into platinum sensitive, platinum resistant or platinum refractory subgroups.\n\n\nPlatinum sensitivity status has been defined by the length of time from which a patient had been treated with front-line therapy, with 6 months marking the delineation between the sensitive and resistant patients. Those patients who demonstrate progression of tumor during front-line therapy are defined as having platinum refractory disease.\n\n\nThe 6-month delineation between platinum sensitive and platinum resistant disease is based upon the changes in response rates when patients were compared before and after this arbitrary cutoff. Patients who recur just after 6 months from platinum-treatment cessation may respond in a similar manner to a patient whose tumor is platinum resistant compared with a patient whose tumor recurs after 12 or more months. The response rates to platinum re-challenge rise significantly after 12 months from the time of front-line therapy.\n\n\nPlatinum refractory disease\nPatients with refractory disease show evidence of a lack of response to front-line therapy, most often in the form of progressive disease. These patients generally exhibit poor objective responses to almost all agents available for re-treatment and the choice of therapy depends upon patient wishes and comorbidities.\n\n\nPatients that develop platinum refractory disease are good candidates for clinical trials in that new active agents may potentially be identified. Furthermore, a thorough discussion with the patient and her family is necessary to communicate the overall poor prognosis and the low likelihood of identifying an agent that will impart an objective response of any significant duration. Some patients may opt to continue active treatment while others may choose supportive care. In the event that patients are treated with a chemotherapeutic and develop stable disease, it may be prudent to continue with treatment until demonstrable evidence of progression of disease.\n\n\nPlatinum resistant disease\nPatients who are defined as having platinum resistance disease develop objective evidence of recurrent disease within 6 months of previous platinum-based therapy. Technically, to be defined as resistant, these patients should be re-challenged with platinum and in turn show a lack of clinical response.\n\n\nDue to the poor response rates to re-challenging these patients, most clinicians omit re-challenging with platinums and move directly to other therapies. If an agent is found to result in stable disease with mitigation or elimination of symptoms, these patients are likely deriving clinical benefit despite showing now objective evidence of response. Thus these patients may benefit from continued treatment until progression.\n\n\nThe most common treatments for platinum resistant disease are listed in  Table I .\n\n\nTherapy options\n\n\nThree novel agents with unique cytotoxic mechanisms of action have been the most commonly utilized choices in the platinum resistant setting. Two of these agents, pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) and topotecan, are FDA approved for the treatment of recurrent ovarian cancer. PLD is currently the most frequently utilized of all the options in this setting, yet drug shortages in 2011 and beyond have changed prescribing. The third agent, gemcitabine, has been granted approval only in combination with platinum in the platinum sensitive group, but has been used in combination as well as a single agent in resistant disease.\n\n\nPLD\n\n\nPLD consists of doxorubicin that is encapsulated in liposomes and then pegylated or coated with polyethylene glycol. These two processes effect a marked reduction in the cardiac toxicity associated with doxorubicin while prolonging the half-life of the PLD compound such that less frequent dosing is necessary.\n\n\nIn phase II trials, PLD has been shown to have a 14-20% response rate when used as a single agent in patients with recurrent disease. The pivotal phase III randomized trial compared PLD to topotecan and demonstrated a similar response rate and time to progression. Updated survival analysis in this trial noted that patients receiving PLD had an overall survival advantage compared with those treated with topotecan due to the significant survival advantage of PLD seen in patients with platinum-sensitive disease. Survival was not statistically different between agents for those with platinum-resistant disease.\n\n\nThe FDA approved dose for PLD of 50mg/M2 administered every 4 weeks has most commonly been reduced to 40 mg/M2 to decrease the incidence of the two most common significant toxicities: palmer-plantar erythrodysthesia (PPE) and mucositis.\n\n\nTopotecan\n\n\nTopotecan is a semi-synthetic derivative of campothecin. Its mechanism of action is as a direct inhibitor of topoisomerase I. This enzyme is critical in the DNA replication process, and inhibition of this enzyme by topotecan results in single and double strand DNA breaks that accumulate and result in apoptotic cell death. Topotecan showed response rates of 14–18% in patients clinically defined as platinum-resistant or platinum-refractory. Significantly, up to nearly 50% of patients demonstrated stable disease in most studies.\n\n\nThe drug has been administered using an on-label 5-day schedule with 30-minute, intravenous (IV) bolus infusions of 1.5 mg/m  repeated every 21 days. The dose-limiting toxicity associated with this schedule has been significant neutropenia. Lower doses of topotecan to reduce the incidence of grade 3 and 4 neutropenia that can approach 80% with the traditional dosing schedule have been investigated. The results of these studies demonstrated that the dose of topotecan could be lowered to 1.25 or even 1.0 mg/m  without significantly compromising efficacy while decreasing the incidence of toxicity.\n\n\nAlthough, these data were based on a 5-day infusion every 3 weeks, phase II data has suggested that weekly topotecan at 4 mg/m  is tolerable and efficacious. This weekly regimen is associated with less myelosuppression, but equivalent antitumor activity has not been uniformly seen across trials as some have shown decreased efficacy especially in terms of response with the weekly schedule. Others have explored the use of a 3-day infusion schedule at a dose of 2.0 mg/m with mixed results in terms of efficacy, but with a decrease in the toxicity as well. Currently, the weekly schedule seems to be most utilized despite the concerns with decreased response.\n\n\nGemcitabine\n\n\nThe nucleoside analogue gemcitabine initially received an indication in pancreatic cancer and has been utilized in several malignancies including ovarian carcinoma. When utilized in platinum-paclitaxel refractory or resistant ovarian cancer, a 16% objective response rate with median duration of response of 4 months was achieved.\n\n\nGemcitabine is well tolerated and does not exhibit cumulative myelosuppression, and it is given as a weekly regimen at doses ranging from 800 to 1,200 mg/m . Combination data with PLD or platinum has demonstrated some impressive response rates in platinum resistant patients with responses in the 40% range. The Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) completed a trial that exhibited only a 16% response rate in platinum resistant patients when treated with a combination of cisplatinum and gemcitabine, but the progression free survival (PFS) appeared impressive.\n\n\nOther agents\n\n\nA number of other agents are available for the treatment of ovarian cancer. Weekly paclitaxel is a frequently utilized option, and response rates compare favorably to other options for these patients. One of the most active single agents in platinum resistant disease is a novel taxane compound, docetaxel, which has shown significant activity with impressive single agent response rates\n\n\nOne well done study by the Gynecologic Oncology Group(GOG) exhibited a 22% response. Hexamethylmelamineis also FDA approved for recurrent ovarian cancer and has demonstrated activity in patients with platinum and/or paclitaxel resistant disease. In a GOG study, however, it was noted to have very limited activity in patients with relapsed platinum-refractory ovarian cancer.\n\n\nOral etoposide has been noted to have significant activity in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer. In a GOG study where patients received a starting dose of 50 mg/m  for 21 days, the investigators noted a complete response of 7% and a partial response of nearly 20%, for an overall response rate of 27%. Higher cumulative doses and prolonged therapy increase the risk of myelodysplastic syndromes and acute leukemias. These concerns are of less importance in these poor prognosis patients with platinum-resistant disease.\n\n\nIfosfamide, an alkylating agent, is administered at a dose of 1.0 or 1.2 g/m  for 5 days plus 200 mg/m  or 240 mg/m in combination with mesna for uroprotection against hemorrhagic cystitis. In one trial, this regimen produced a response rate of 12% in platinum-refractory patients. Other agents such as tamoxifen demonstrate response rates of 10-15% in those with platinum-resistant ovarian carcinomas. In platinum-resistant patients, weekly vinorelbine administered at a dose of 25 mg/m  intravenously was noted to have a response rate of approximately 20%.\n\n\nBevacizumab, an anti-angiogenesis agent, is not yet approved for treatment of ovarian cancer in the U.S., but this compound has shown promise in patients with recurrent disease. In one GOG study with a mixture of platinum resistant and sensitive patients, a response rate of 21% and no progression of disease in over 40% of patients at 6 months was observed. This compound is especially effective at targeting ascites and pleural effusions. Data on combinations of bevacizumab with chemotherapeutics such as low dose cyclophosphamide has shown activity as well. Side effects are discussed below.\n\n\nAnother agent not approved for ovarian cancer, yet with demonstrated activity is pemetrexed, an antifolate that inhibits multiple enzymes in the DNA synthesis pathway. Synergy between platinum and pemetrexed has been documented. To estimate the anti-tumor activity and toxicity of pemetrexed in patients with persistent or recurrent platinum-resistant epithelial ovarian or primary peritoneal cancer who have failed on higher priority treatment protocols, a multicenter cooperative group phase II trial was conducted by the GOG. Pemetrexed 900 mg/m  was administered as an IV infusion over 10 minutes every 21 days and continued until disease progression or unacceptable adverse effects.\n\n\nA total of 51 patients were enrolled and received 259 cycles (median: 4; range 1-19) of pemetrexed. 40% of patients received 6 or more cycles. There was 1 CR and 9 PR (21% ORR) with a median duration of response of 6.8 months. An additional 35% had stable disease for 4.1 months. Thirty-eight percent had progressive disease. The median PFS was 3+ months with OS 11.4+ months. The treatment was well tolerated; grade 3/4 toxicities included neutropenia (42%), leukopenia (25%), anemia (15%), and constitutional symptoms (15%). No treatment-related deaths were reported.\n\n\nHormonal agents, including tamoxifen, have shown activity in recurrent ovarian cancer, especially in patients with psammoma carcinomas. These agents can result in anti-angiogenic effects and are well tolerated.\n\n\nPlatinum sensitive disease\nThe treatment approach for patients who recur more than six months after having received primary platinum therapy, defined as platinum sensitive disease, is usually combination chemotherapy. This combination includes a platinum agent.\n\n\nThe question is, should these patients also be retreated with a taxane in addition to the platinum agent? A second question is, should all patients be treated preferentially with a platinum-based regimen or should some patients be treated with non-platinum compounds at the time of first recurrence? If so, who are the best candidates for treatment with a non-platinum agent? The common platinum-based combinations are listed in  Table II .\n\n\nSeveral large randomized trials have examined the role of platinum-based combination therapy versus single agent platinum in platinum sensitive patients. The results of these trials have established that there is a benefit to adding a second active agent to those patients who have an adequate performance status. The first trial was conducted by the ICON4 AGO OVAR 2.2 investigators and compared platinum versus platinum and a taxane. This trial, known as ICON 4, showed a statistically improved progression-free and overall survival.\n\n\nAnalysis of this phase III trial revealed significant methodological problems due to subgroup heterogeneity as entry criteria and assessment of response differed among the three groups that enrolled patients. Nonetheless, the importance of the survival advantage demonstrated in this trial cannot be completely discounted, and the platinum-based doublet should serve as the control arm in future trials. The median treatment-free interval for both arms of the trial exceeded 12 months in 75% of cases. Thus the advantage of combination therapy in patients who recur 6-12 months after primary treatment is not clearly established in this study.\n\n\nThe Intergroup trial was principally conducted by the AGO (ArbeitsgemeinschaftGynakologischeOnkologie), and showed that there was a progression-free survival advantage in using platinum in combination with gemcitabine versus using platinum alone. In this trial, there was a progression-free survival benefit for the combination even in the 6-12 month cohort.\n\n\nUnfortunately, the methodology of that study precluded assessment of overall survival as an endpoint, as it was under-powered to assess this end point, but there was no trend toward any significant improvement in overall survival. In addition, greater toxicity was demonstrated with the combination. The incidence of grade 3/4 neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and anemia was statistically significantly greater in the combination treatment group.\n\n\nThese studies certainly provide evidence that support primary re-treatment with platinum-based compounds. However, the applicability of these trials to all patients with platinum sensitive disease may not be completely valid. The majority of the patients in the ICON4 trial had long platinum free intervals. Thus it may not be necessary to treat those with shorter platinum free intervals with platinum.\n\n\nIt may be possible to achieve the same efficacy by sequencing platinum and other agents without the increase in toxicities observed with platinum-based combination therapy. What these trials have done is establish a new standard. The current convention is to prescribe platinum-based combination therapy for all patients with platinum free intervals of greater than 12 months and for most who recur between 6 and 12 months. Those who are 6-12 months from prior treatment have tumor responses that are not so superior to that of single agents. Thus monotherapy may be considered as an option for those who recur closer to 6 months from prior treatment.\n\n\nFurther trials have tried to define the best option for the second agent that is paired with platinum. The CALYPSO trial compared carboplatin/paclitaxel versus carboplatin/PLD in platinum sensitive patients and found a modest but statistically improved PFS favoring the PLD cohort. No difference in OS was seen, but the investigators concluded that the toxicity and quality of life overall appeared to favor the PLD group as well.\n\n\nThe latest data to be presented combined a targeted anti-angiogenic agent with a platinum/gemcitabine chemotherapy backbone in patients with platinum sensitive disease. The trial compared chemotherapy alone with carboplatin (AUC 4)/gemcitabine (1000 mg days 1 and 8) versus the same regimen plus bevacizumab 15 mg/kg with chemotherapy and until progression. The primary end-point PFS differed by four months (12.4 vs. 8.4), favoring the bevacizumab treated cohort. Additionally the response rate was higher as well (79% vs. 57%). Toxicity was increased with greater hypertension and proteinuria, but no new safety signals were raised as the bevacizumab regimen was well tolerated. GOG 213, besides assessing the value of secondary cytoreduction in platinum sensitive patients, compared the value of adding bevacizumab to carboplatin and paclitaxel chemotherapy in a randomized fashion.\n\n\nThe decision for retreatment versus novel agent administration depends upon multiple factors, including toxicity from prior therapy, patient performance status and co-morbidities, symptoms of recurrence and goals of therapy. Patients with platinum sensitive disease are excellent candidates for clinical trials. This subgroup of patients has been the cornerstone of new drug development, since they have significant and well-characterized response rates that serve as benchmarks for comparison to potentially new active compounds.\n\n\nTargeted agents\nThe concept that one can specifically target a molecule, protein or pathway that is over-expressed or up-regulated in cancer, but not in normal tissues, is appealing theoretically. To that end, a large number of compounds have been tested in patients with ovarian cancer.\n\n\nA number of promising compounds such as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors, Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors, and anti-angiogenics, among many others, are in development. PARP inhibitors have shown excellent responses in both platinum resistant and sensitive patients, even in patients who lacked BRCA mutations. These agents, however, are not yet clinically available.\n\n\nInhibiting angiogenesis is a rational strategy in the treatment of ovarian cancer as this is a vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) driven tumor. The anti-angiogenic compound furthest in development for ovarian cancer is bevacizumab, which binds VEGF ligand.\n\n\nThe results of GOG 170-D included 62 platinum sensitive and platinum resistant patients with recurrent or persistent epithelial ovarian or primary peritoneal cancer. Bevacizumab was administered at a dose of 15mg/kg IV every 3 weeks until disease progression or toxicity was reached. The overall objective response rate was 21%, and 55% of the patients were assessed as having had stable disease. The six months progression free survival (PFS) was 40%. Toxicity assessment revealed four patients with grade 3/4 gastrointestinal events, with one patient having a small bowel obstruction. Grade 3 hypertension was observed in four patients. Three patients developed venous thromboembolism.\n\n\nA second phase II trial reported a 28% response rate and a 55% stable disease rate with the use of bevacizumab in combination with metronomic (low dose) cyclophosphamide in 29 patients treated with bevacizumab at a dose of 10 mg/m2 IV on days 1, 8, 15 and then every two weeks plus cyclophosphamide 50 mg orally every day. Cannistra reported the results from a multi-center, single-arm Phase II trial evaluating bevacizumab in platinum refractory /resistant ovarian cancer patients. Due to an unexpectedly high level of bowel perforations (5 of 44 patients or 11%), enrollment was suspended.\n\n\nThe phase III OCEANS trial seen in  Table II  showed adding bevacizumab to carboplatin/gemcitabine improved PFS and response. Further affimative data is seen in the AURELIA trial in platinum resistant p.\n",

        "text": "The role of surgery in recurrent ovarian cancer\nThe concept of performing surgery in patients who have recurrent ovarian cancer has been controversial and often vexing as different investigators have used different definitions in reporting their findings. Some have confused secondary cytoreduction with second-look, a procedure to determine disease status for patients with no clinical evidence of disease following front-line therapy. Defining clear benefit from either procedure has been difficult in high quality studies. Clearly those who are poor candidates are those patients in whom there is a short treatment-free interval and who have evidence of multifocal disease or ascites.\n\n\nSeveral trials have shown clinical benefit for secondary cytoreduction in those patients who have had the longest treatment-free intervals usually exceeding 12 months or longer, and their radiographic findings have been limited to isolated masses. Such patients should be counseled to consider the option of reoperation as removal of these tumors may improve survival. Prospective data is being collected in trials in Europe to assess the ability to determine prognostic factors that predict successful selection of patients for secondary cytoreduction and to see if there is a survival advantage. GOG 213 also will report on the value of secondary cytoreduction in platinum sensitive patients upon completion of this portion of the trial.\n\n\n7.

        "text": "IP Chemotherapy for Ovarian Cancer\n\n\n    \n\n        Printable PDF Version\nAbout This Treatment\nIntraperitoneal, or IP chemotherapy, is a treatment for ovarian cancer where chemotherapy is put inside your abdomen. This treatment may or may not be combined with chemotherapy that is given in your vein (IV). A port will be placed under your skin and over your ribs to give this chemotherapy into your abdomen.\nDuring an IP chemotherapy treatment, you will lie flat on a bed while chemotherapy runs into your abdomen over a few hours.\nPossible Side Effects (More Common)\n\n    This drug may affect how your kidneys work. Your kidney function will be checked as needed.\n\n    Electrolyte changes. Your blood will be checked for electrolyte changes as needed.\n\n    Effects on the nerves are called peripheral neuropathy. You may feel numbness or pain in your hands and feet. It may be hard for you to button your clothes, open jars, or walk as usual. The effect on the nerves may get worse with more doses of the drug. These effects get better in some people after the drug is stopped, but it does not get better in all people.\n\n    High-frequency hearing loss may occur. You will get IV fluids before and during the infusion to help prevent this. You may also get ringing in the ears.\n\n    Bone marrow depression. This is a decrease in the number of white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets. This may raise your risk of infection, make you tired and weak (fatigue), and raise your risk of bleeding.\n\n    Nausea and throwing up (vomiting). These symptoms may happen within a few hours after your treatment and may last for a few days to a week. Medicines are available to stop or lessen these side effects.\n\n    Hair loss. You may notice your hair getting thin. Some patients lose their hair. Your hair often grows back when treatment is done.\nPossible Side Effects (Less Common)\n\n    Blurred vision or other changes in eyesight\n\n    Soreness of the mouth and throat. You may have red areas, white patches, or sores that hurt.\n\n    Flu-like symptoms: fever, headache, muscle and joint aches, and fatigue (low energy, feeling weak)\n\n    Nail problems: changes in color, thinning, brittleness, or loss of the nail\n\n    Skin and tissue irritation may include redness, pain, warmth, or swelling at the IV site. This happens if the drug leaks out of the vein and into nearby tissue.\nAllergic Reactions\nSerious allergic reactions including anaphylaxis are rare. While you are getting these drugs in your vein (IV), tell your nurse right away if you have any of these symptoms of an allergic reaction:\n\n    trouble catching your breath\n\n    feeling like your tongue or throat are swelling\n\n    feeling your heart beat quickly or in a not normal way (palpitations)\n\n    feeling dizzy or lightheaded\n\n    flushing, itching, rash, and/or hives\nTreating Side Effects\n\n    Drink 6-8 cups of fluids each day unless your doctor has told you to limit your fluid intake due to some other health problem. A cup is 8 ounces of fluid. If you throw up or have loose bowel movements you should drink more fluids so that you do not become dehydrated (lack water in the body due to losing too much fluid). \n\n    If you have numbness and tingling in your hands and feet, be careful when cooking, walking, and handling sharp objects and hot liquids. \n\n    Ask your doctor or nurse about medicine that is available to help stop or lessen fever, headache, back, muscle, and joint aches.\n\n    Ask your doctor or nurse about medicine that is available to help stop or lessen nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, nasal congestion and/or sinus symptoms.\n\n    If you get a rash do not put anything on it unless your doctor or nurse says you may. Keep the area around the rash clean and dry. Ask your doctor for medicine if your rash bothers you. \n\n    During the IV infusion please tell your nurse right away if you get any pain, redness, or swelling at the site of the IV infusion.\n\n    Talk with your nurse about getting a wig before you lose your hair. Also, call the American Cancer Society at 800-ACS-2345 to find out information about the “Look Good, Feel Better” program close to where you live. It is a free program where women getting chemotherapy can learn about wigs, turbans and scarves as well as makeup techniques and skin and nail care.\nFood and Drug Interactions\nThere are no known interactions of these drugs with food. These drugs may interact with other medicines. Tell your doctor and pharmacist about all the medicines and dietary supplements (vitamins, minerals, herbs and others) that you are taking at this time. The safety and use of dietary supplements and alternative diets are often not known. Using these might affect your cancer or interfere with your treatment. Until more is known, you should not use dietary supplements or alternative diets without your cancer doctor's help.\nImportant Instructions\nLet your doctor know if you have had any recent vaccinations. Talk to your doctor before getting vaccines during or after treatment with these drugs.\nWhen to Call the Doctor\nCall your doctor or nurse  if you have any of these symptoms:\n\n    Fever of 100.5 F (38 C) or higher \n\n    Chills \n\n    Easy bleeding or bruising \n\n    Rash or itching \n\n    Feeling dizzy or lightheaded\n\n    Loose bowel movements (diarrhea) more than 4 times a day or diarrhea with weakness or lightheadedness \n\n    Pain when passing urine; blood in urine \n\n    Pain in your lower back or side \n\n    Nausea that stops you from eating or drinking \n\n    Throwing up more than 3 times a day \nCall your doctor or nurse as soon as possible if any of these symptoms happen:\n\n    Change in hearing, ringing in the ears \n\n    Decreased urine\n\n    Nausea that is not relieved by prescribed medicines \n\n    Rash that is not relieved by prescribed medicines \n\n    Heavy menstrual period that lasts longer than normal\n\n    Numbness, tingling, decreased feeling or weakness in fingers, toes, arms, or legs \n\n    Trouble walking or changes in the way you walk, feeling clumsy when buttoning clothes, opening jars, or other routine hand motions \n\n    Swelling of legs, ankles, or feet \n\n    Weight gain of 5 pounds in one week (fluid retention) \n\n    Lasting loss of appetite or rapid weight loss of five pounds in a week \n\n    Fatigue that interferes with your daily activities\n\n    Headache that does not go away\n\n    No bowel movement for 3 days or you feel uncomfortable \n\n    Extreme weakness that interferes with normal activities\nSexual Problems and Reproduction Concerns\n\n    Sexual problems and reproduction concerns may happen. In men and women both, these drugs may affect your ability to have children. This cannot be determined before your therapy. Talk with your doctor or nurse if you plan to have children.  Ask for information on sperm or egg banking.\n\n    This drug may have harmful effects on the unborn child, so effective methods of birth control should be used during your cancer treatment. \n\n     Women should not breast feed during treatment because this drug could enter the breast milk and badly harm a breast feeding baby.\n\n    Genetic counseling is available for you to talk about the effects of this drug therapy on future pregnancies. Also, a genetic counselor can look at the possible risk of problems in the unborn baby due to this medicine if an exposure happens during pregnancy.\n",

IP chemotherapy was used in less than half of women in the study.\nIP chemotherapy is delivered through an implanted subcutaneous port that drains into the cavity of the abdomen, allowing direct access for the drug to the peritoneal cavity, where ovarian cancer has spread. Its use, however, can cause more frequent and more severe side effects than IV chemotherapy, including abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting.\nIn 2006, results from a large clinical trial showed that treatment with IP and IV chemotherapy extended median overall survival for patients with ovarian cancer by more than a year, compared with women treated with IV chemotherapy alone.\nFollowing release of the trial results, NCI issued a clinical announcement detailing findings from the trial and other trials of IP chemotherapy in patients with ovarian cancer, noting that the treatment approach was associated with a “significant survival benefit… compared to IV chemotherapy alone.”\nHowever, it wasn’t known whether IP chemotherapy (in combination with IV chemotherapy) is routinely used in clinical practice. To investigate, Alexi Wright, M.D., of the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, and her colleagues prospectively collected treatment plans and outcomes from 2005-2012, and retrospectively from 2003-2005, for 823 patients who were diagnosed with advanced ovarian cancer at six National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) centers. All of the patients were treated outside of a clinical trial.\nThey found that use of IP treatments increased from 0 to 33 percent between 2003 and 2006, and up to 50 percent by 2008, leveling off from that point forward. Use of IP chemotherapy in eligible patients, however, varied substantially by NCCN center, from 4 percent to 67 percent. When IP chemotherapy was used, the treatment was modified in more than 40 percent of patients from the approach used in the definitive phase III clinical trial.\nThe 3-year overall survival was 81 percent in women treated with IP/IV chemotherapy (402 women), compared with 71 percent in those treated with IV chemotherapy alone. Nearly 60 percent of women who received IP chemotherapy completed all planned cycles of therapy, and there were no differences in infections or nausea and vomiting between the two groups.\n“In our study we looked at ovarian cancer patients who were treated in clinical practice and found the same results as the clinical trial, but with less toxicity to patients,” Dr. Wright said. “This suggests that IP chemotherapy really is feasible to use in clinical practice and should be more widely used. It is low hanging fruit to improve outcomes for patients with ovarian cancer.”\nThe study did not examine why IP chemotherapy is underused outside of clinical trials, explained Elise Kohn, M.D., head of Gynecologic Cancer Therapeutics in NCI’s Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis.\n“However, we know many patients in clinical trials stop IP chemotherapy early because it is too toxic,” Dr. Kohn said. “IP therapy may be cut short, for example, if the port delivery system malfunctions, if there is an infection at the site of implant, or if patients are unable to tolerate pain or other side effects associated with drug administration.”\nThe centers in the study used many different drugs, schedules, and doses, Dr. Wright explained, so the researchers were unable to directly compare the effectiveness of each of the different treatment combinations and modifications.\nThe types of modifications made, including lowering chemotherapy doses and switching the drugs being used, “suggests that clinicians were doing so to avoid harming their patients,” Dr. Wright continued.\nNevertheless, the improved survival with IP chemotherapy “suggests this may be due to the route of delivery, not differences in drugs,” Dr. Wright concluded.\nDr. Kohn noted that NCI is supporting trials to better understand how best to use IP chemotherapy, including a multi-center phase III trial testing IP/IV chemotherapy in combination with bevacizumab in patients with stage II-III ovarian cancer.\n",

        "text": "Intraperitoneal vs IV Chemotherapy in Ovarian Cancer: How Do They Compare?\nA trial compared two intraperitoneal chemotherapy regimens and an intravenous regimen for newly diagnosed advanced ovarian carcinoma.\nA trial comparing two intraperitoneal (IP) chemotherapy regimens and an intravenous (IV) regimen for newly diagnosed advanced ovarian carcinoma found no differences with regard to progression-free survival between the groups. The IV and IP carboplatin regimens were better tolerated than the IP cisplatin regimen.\nThe new study was based on previous work that found significantly improved survival with IP cisplatin and paclitaxel compared with IV therapy. “Despite the survival benefit, less than half of eligible women treated at National Cancer Institute comprehensive cancer centers received this treatment,” wrote study authors led by Joan L. Walker, MD, of the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center in Oklahoma City. It has been suggested that a less toxic, less complicated to deliver, and more feasible outpatient regimen is still needed.\nThe new study included a total of 1,560 women with newly diagnosed advanced ovarian carcinoma, randomized to receive one of three regimens: IV paclitaxel along with IV carboplatin (IV group, 521 patients); IV paclitaxel along with IP carboplatin (IP carboplatin group, 518 patients); or IV paclitaxel along with IP cisplatin (IP cisplatin group, 521 patients). All patients received bevacizumab as well. Patients were followed for a median of 84.8 months, and the results were published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology\n.\nIn the full trial cohort, patients were a median age of 58 years; 72% had primary tumors with a high-grade serous histology, 58% had only microscopic residual disease, 93% had residual tumor of 1 cm or less, and 84% had stage III disease.\nThe median progression-free survival duration was 24.9 months in the IV group, 27.4 months with IP carboplatin, and 26.2 months with IP cisplatin. Compared with the IV therapy, IP carboplatin had a hazard ratio (HR) for first progression or death of 0.925 (95% CI, 0.802–1.07); for IP cisplatin, the HR was 0.977 (95% CI, 0.847–1.13).\nSimilar results were seen among the 1,380 patients who had stage II or III and optimally resected to 1 cm or less residual disease, with no significant differences between the therapy groups. When restricted to the 870 patients with stage II or III and no gross residual disease documented at the completion of surgery, there was again no significant difference.\nThe median overall survival was 75.5 months with IV therapy, compared with 78.9 months with IP carboplatin and 72.9 months with IP cisplatin. The HR for death with IP carboplatin compared with IV therapy was 0.949 (95% CI, 0.799–1.128); for IP cisplatin, the HR was 1.05 (95% CI, 0.884–1.24).\nA total of 25 deaths during the study were attributed in part to toxicity (8 in the IV group, 7 in the IP carboplatin group, and 10 in the IP cisplatin group). Grade 3 or worse infections were more common in the IP groups than in the IV group (P\n = .008). Grade 3 or worse nausea or vomiting was more common in the IP cisplatin group, at 11.0% compared with 5.1% in the IV group and 4.7% in the IP carboplatin group (P\n < .005). Several other adverse effects were also worse with IP cisplatin than the other therapies, including hypertension and central nervous system ischemia.\nPatient-reported outcomes were similar across the groups. However, the mean Trial Outcome Index of the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Ovary scores during chemotherapy treatment were worse with IP cisplatin than with the other regimens.\n“The benefit of IP administration of chemotherapy was not evident in this large randomized clinical trial,” the authors concluded, though they noted that IP therapy may still be beneficial in certain patients.\nIn an accompanying “Oncology Grand Rounds” article, authors led by Sara Bouberhan, MD, of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, wrote that the addition of bevacizumab or changes to the specifics of the dosing schedules could potentially explain the lack of effect seen with IP therapy. They noted that there are ongoing trials that could provide more clarity on preferred treatments.\nStudies such as this “suggest that new strategies will be needed to further improve the treatment of advanced ovarian cancer,” they wrote. “Emerging, novel combinations of antiangiogenic agents, PARP inhibitors, and immune checkpoint inhibitors will be a critical next step in improving the outcomes of patients with this disease.”\n"

        "text": "Hand-Foot Syndrome\nAuthor: OncoLink Team\nRead more about our content writing process\nLast Reviewed: \nWhat is Hand-Foot Syndrome (HFS)?\nHand-foot syndrome (HFS) is a skin reaction on the palms of the hands and/or the soles of the feet as a result of certain chemotherapy agents. It may also be referred to as acral erythema, palmar plantar erythema (PPE), or Burgdorf reaction. Chemotherapy drugs known to cause HFS include: capecitabine (Xeloda®), fluorouracil (5-FU), liposomal doxorubicin (Doxil®), doxorubicin (Adriamycin®), cytarabine (Ara-c®), sunitinib (Sutent®) and sorafenib (Nexavar®).\nHFScan start as a feeling of tingling or numbness in the palms and/or soles, which leads to swelling, redness, peeling skin, and tenderness or pain. If there is no change in the treatment, the hands and/or feet can blister, which can then become infected. These blisters become very painful and can interfere with daily activities. It is very important to tell your care team at the first sign of HFS. Most patients that develop HFS do so within the first few weeks of therapy, but it can also happen after being on the medication for many months.\nWhat causes HFS?\nNo one knows for sure, but there are a few theories. The most widely accepted theory is that the small blood vessels in the palms and/or soles break due to use, pressure, or increased temperature. This causes an inflammatory reaction and a possible release of the drug into the area. Many of the suggested prevention strategies or treatments for HFS are based on this theory.\nHow can I prevent HFS?\nUnfortunately, there is nothing specific you can do to prevent HFS. The key is to catch it early and adjust the chemotherapy dose to prevent it from getting worse or happening again. It is important to note that several studies have shown that lowering the dose of chemotherapy to relieve HFS does not reduce the effectiveness of the treatment. Some tips to help prevent HFS include:\nAvoid tight fitting clothing (socks, stockings) or tight shoes. Wear loose, comfy shoes when going out and slippers around the house. Do not go barefoot.\nAvoid activities that rub the skin or put pressure on the palms or soles for one week after treatment (or as often as possible if you are on a daily medication). Any activity that puts pressure on the palms or soles should be avoided, but some examples include: washing vigorously, running, jumping, aerobics, long periods of walking, working with garden or repair tools (i.e. shovel, screwdriver, hammer) or chopping food.\nApply a moisturizer to your hands and feet liberally and often, but gently to avoid rubbing the skin too harshly. Try applying a good amount of moisturizer at bedtime and wear a loose pair of cotton gloves or socks to bed to help the lotion absorb into the skin. Some recommended moisturizers are Bag Balm, Udderly Smooth Cream, Eucerin, and Aveeno. Avoid any lotions or creams that have perfumes, alcohol or glycerin.\nAvoid hot water such as a hot tub, steam room, hot bath or shower, or when washing dishes. Use warm water to shower or bathe and keep showers/baths short. Use tepid water when washing dishes. Do not use rubber gloves to wash dishes as they can cause further irritation by holding heat against your palms.\nAvoid sun exposure as your skin is very sensitive to the sun while on treatment. Remember, you get sun exposure just sitting near a sunny window! Wear SPF 30 or higher daily or wear long sleeved shirts and pants.\nApplying ice packs to the palms of the hands and soles of the feet during the infusion of some chemotherapy medications may be helpful in preventing HFS. Ask your provider if this is appropriate for your treatment.\nIf I develop HFS, what can be done?\nThe first and most important step is to tell your care team right away if you notice any numbness, tingling, redness, peeling, swelling, or pain. Your provider may stop the chemotherapy for a short time to allow the skin to heal, but in many cases, just reducing the dose is enough to allow the skin to heal. Dose reduction or a break from therapy is the only thing proven to heal HFS, but there are some things you can do that can help you deal with the discomfort or help HFS to heal faster:\nSoaking the hands and/or feet in cold water or applying ice packs can relieve pain and tenderness. Use a bag of frozen peas or corn, as these can conform to your hand or foot. Do not keep the cold on for more than 15-20 minutes at a time, but you can alternate the ice on and off.\nContinue to use lotions or moisturizers often, but applied gently.\nElevating the hands or feet may help decrease swelling.\nSome providers use vitamin B6 to help speed healing. Talk to your care team before taking any vitamins.\nAn over the counter pain reliever, such as acetaminophen, may help with the discomfort. A topical pain reliever, in a cream or patch form, may also be used. Talk to your provider before taking any medications.\nIf you develop blisters, do not break them as they can become infected.\nIf you develop a fever (temperature above 100.4°F/38°C), call your care team right away.\n Tell your care team as soon as you notice any symptoms of HFS! Do not \"wait and see\" if the symptoms will get better on their own.\nReferences\nCancer.Net. 2019.

Talk with your care team about the cause, as this can affect how it is best fixed.\nIncreasing fiber (including Metamucil) in the diet is often not effective if your constipation is caused by pain medication. In those cases, you should take a laxative after speaking to your healthcare provider about which one is right for you.\nDrink 6-8 glasses of fluid per day. Try warm or hot fluids, especially in the morning.\nIncrease your physical activity as much as possible. Even short walks will help decrease constipation.\nTry to have a bowel movement at a regular time each day, preferably after breakfast.\nPrune, apple, peach, and pear nectars/juices may be helpful as they have a laxative effect, but how they work varies from person to person and they may cause diarrhea.\nHow is constipation treated?\nTreatment of constipation depends on its cause. Your provider may recommend a bowel regimen using fiber and/or laxatives.\nA fiber supplement may be helpful to relieve constipation that is not caused by pain medications. This is often the first treatment tried.\nPolyethylene glycol 3350 (Miralax) is an osmotic laxative. It works by causing stool to retain, or hold on to water. This makes the stool softer so it is easier to pass. It can be used to relieve constipation or taken regularly to help chronic constipation.\nA stimulant laxative (such as Bisacodyl, Dulcolax, or Senakot) works by stimulating peristalsis, moving the stool through the bowel. These should only be used for a few days. \nYou may need to combine these medications to find what works best for you. Your care team can help you make a plan. \nDo not use enemas unless told to do so by your care team. If you do not have a bowel movement in 3 or more days, talk with your provider about a stronger medication. If you have any questions about constipation or need more information, ask your provider.\nReferences\nPaquette, I. M., Varma, M., Ternent, C., Melton-Meaux, G., Rafferty, J.

        "text": "Caregiving Basics\nAuthor: OncoLink Team\nRead more about our content writing process\nLast Reviewed: \nWhat is caregiving?\nA caregiver is defined as a \"person who attends to the needs of a dependent child or adult.\" Caregivers manage the physical, emotional, spiritual, and practical needs of another person, all while managing their own life, needs, family, and career.\nOn the surface, this doesn't sound like a particularly glamorous job. Caregiving can be exhausting, frustrating, anxiety-provoking, stressful, and nerve-wracking. It can test our body, our spirit, our emotions, and our patience. It may present us with financial challenges. The needs of our loved one may outweigh our capacity as caregivers and often trump our own needs. The caregiver may be tested, pushed, exhausted, scared, and isolated.\nDespite all this, caregiving is often a rewarding, bonding, cherished, and important experience between loved ones that few would ever choose not to do again. Caregiving gives us the opportunity to connect, love, show affection, dote upon, reminisce, and be compassionate and empathetic towards an individual for whom we care.\nWho provides care?\nCaregivers are typically family members, though not always immediate family members, like a spouse or child. Family caregivers can also be cousins, nieces, uncles, grandparents, or even friends. Depending on the needs of the person being cared for, caregiving may take more than one person - or a caregiving team. Members of the team can include family members, professionals (from a home care agency), community supports (church members, neighbors), and friends.\nCaregivers play multiple roles in the care of a patient. The caregiver must be a skilled communicator. The caregiver must be able to multi-task; often juggling the physical, emotional, and practical needs of the patient, while continuing to live their own lives. The caregiver will often play the role of advocate - speaking up for the patient when s/he cannot. Caregiving requires a great deal of commitment, flexibility, respect, and empathy from the caregiver. The caregiver can expect to receive gratitude, love, and respect from the patient. Care is not provided on a one-way street.\nThere is also a role for professional assistance in caregiving through skilled nursing agencies. These agencies provide nursing services, physical/occupational/speech therapy, IV therapy, social work support, and limited non-skilled home health aide services. Professional agencies can add to your caregiving toolbox by provided needed professional support, medication management, education, and connecting you to other potential sources of support. Utilizing professional agencies is especially important for family caregivers who do not live nearby and need to access services through the patient's medical insurance and private pay resources. Your social worker can help identify agencies in your area that can provide professional caregiving services.\nWhat care do caregivers provide?\nThe tasks of caregiving are wide-ranging and based on the needs of the individual patient. Different caregivers are capable of and comfortable with different tasks, which is why it is helpful to have more than one caregiver. It is also important for the primary caregiver to be able to delegate tasks to others when they need help. One person cannot do it all! Some common tasks include:\nPhysical needs: bathing, dressing, feeding, turning, repositioning.\nEmotional needs: companionship and support.\nPractical needs: transportation to appointments, food shopping, bill paying, and accompanying the patient to medical appointments.\nDo I have\n to do this?\nCaregiving isn't for everyone, and it is OK to say \"no.\" Perhaps the demands of your own family and career make it impossible to add another responsibility. This is okay. It is often better to say \"I can't do this\" than to try to do it and potentially put yourself or your loved one at risk. It is important to remember that you may want to be your loved one's daughter more than you want to be his/her nurse.\nThis is where the \"village\" concept of caregiving applies: it takes a village to provide adequate physical, emotional, and practical care for another individual. It may be necessary to delegate caregiving tasks and dates to multiple family members. It is important that this happens BEFORE the caregiving actually needs to be provided. Sit down as a group WITH the patient and discuss their needs. The patient may not think they need help because they have family involved, but the family has to be realistic with what they can handle. Discuss the plan with the following considerations:\nWhat type of care does the individual need?\nHow often does the individual need help?\nDoes the individual need 24-hour supervision/companionship?\nWhat are our abilities as individuals AND as a group to provide care?\nHow can we fill in gaps in our ability to provide care?\nIf we can't provide this type of care, what are other options; including private duty (paid) care or short/long-term care placement?\nThe benefits of caregiving\nCaregiving can be a rewarding, rich, meaningful experience. It provides individuals with the opportunity to love, support, bond, share and be together. Shifting a focus from the burdens of caregiving to the benefits of caregiving can help you cope. Remember that you are giving back through providing care. You know that your loved one is getting the best possible treatment and support because you are providing it. The caregiving relationship is a gift given to each other.\nSelf-care: The key to maintaining the caregiving relationship\nA caregiver must also take care of him/herself. Self-care includes getting sleep, eating regular meals, maintaining relationships with other family members, exercise, engaging in hobbies, and reflecting on the caregiving experience. The ability to delegate tasks to others is key. Caregivers who ignore their own needs can be at a higher risk for caregiver burnout as well as physical and mental health problems. Remember to ask for help. Take breaks. Meditate. Get a massage. Play games on your phone. Read a chapter of a book. Watch an episode of your favorite old sitcom. It is okay to disconnect, even for a few moments, to re-charge your batteries. You will be a better caregiver if you are able not only to meet the needs of your loved one but also your own needs.\n"

        "text": "Caregiving: Roles and Tasks\nAuthor: OncoLink Team\nRead more about our content writing process\nLast Reviewed: \nThe job description for a caregiver can be overwhelming. The caregiver can be expected to manage the physical, practical, and emotional/spiritual needs of a loved one while continuing to manage his or her own life. In this article, we will explore a bit more about the roles and tasks of the caregivers, as well as how to strategize managing these tasks and roles and to set limits. The caregiver role is \"fluid\"; as your loved one's disease changes, so may your role. It is important to be flexible and to communicate clearly with your loved one about their care needs as they evolve.\nPhysical caregiving needs\nWhile coping with an illness, acute or chronic, the individual requiring care may require physical, medically-based care, and management. As medical care has evolved, less care is being given in the hospital. Many patients are now sent home with high tech medical needs that, not long ago, would have been managed in a hospital. These needs can include tube feedings, chemotherapy, pain management, and wound care. There are also less medically intensive needs, including assistance with mobility and ambulation, repositioning, range of motion exercises, medication management, bathing, dressing, feeding, and supervision for safety.\nLimit setting is extremely important in physical caregiving. There may be tasks that the caregiver feels uncomfortable with providing - it is important to voice your concerns about tasks that you feel you will not be able to perform, for whatever reason. For example, you have a bad back, but your family member requires lifting and repositioning. This is not a safe nor realistic role for the caregiver to play. The health care team can help you strategize for alternative plans and sources of assistance. It is of utmost importance to voice your own limitations to both the health care team and your loved one as care is being put into place. Communicate your needs, fears, and concerns so that safe, appropriate care can be arranged.\nIn many cases, you are being asked to become a nurse for your loved one. This can be a scary reality for the caregiver, but you are not alone. These services are always done in conjunction with and under the supervision of both the physician and a skilled home care agency. Caregivers can be taught (and re-taught) how to provide services to their loved one, how to troubleshoot, as well as when to call for help. Homecare agencies are on call 24 hours a day to provide you with guidance and support. You do not have to do it all on your own. Skilled nursing care, physical therapy, infusion, and wound care services are typically covered by insurance. See our article on \"mobilizing help\" for more information on home care services.\nPractical caregiving needs\nPractical care needs involve assisting your loved one in the management of their daily life and can include paying bills, applying for disability, managing insurance claims, going to appointments, and assisting with medical decision making.\nOverseeing financial tasks may require the appointing of a financial power of attorney. This is not something to be handled lightly. Consult with an attorney to draw up the necessary legal paperwork that affords protections to both you and your loved one. It is important to talk with your loved one about their financial situation, where supplies are located when bills are due, and how you both can work together to manage his or her personal finances.\nAs a caregiver, you may attend medical appointments with your loved one. In this role, you need to be present, take notes, ask questions, and assist your loved one in making decisions with the care team. Your loved one may want to appoint you as medical power of attorney or health care proxy so that in the event that he or she is unable to make decisions, you could make them on his or her behalf. Your social worker can help you with creating these documents.\nIt is important for the caregiver to stay organized. Start a binder or accordion file to keep all the related paperwork. The American Cancer Society offers a free, \"Personal Health Manager\" with tabs and folders to help organize everything from appointment calendars to medication lists to survivorship care plans. Keeping all paperwork necessary for caregiving in one place can be extremely helpful and alleviate the stress of looking for prescriptions, schedules, and legal documents.\nYou may also want to keep a separate folder for managing financial documents, such as disability applications and communication, insurance paperwork, and medical bills. This can help you and your loved one stay on top of needed paperwork and facilitate claims being paid on time. Discuss with your loved one where s/he keeps important documents including their will, living will, life insurance policies, property deeds, and car titles. If your loved one pays bills online, you may want to inventory user names and passwords as well as discuss with him/her if you can access these accounts on his or her behalf. It is important to spell this out in any financial power of attorney document to protect yourself and your loved one.\nEmotional caregiving needs\nWhen faced diagnosis of cancer, your loved one is riding a roller coaster of emotions. Whether you like it or not, you are along for that ride. Your loved one's feelings may change at the drop of the hat. Given your role as caregiver, you may be the one who hears the anger, dries the tears, laughs at a good joke, or hopes with him or her. What can be especially challenging for caregivers is that all of these emotions can happen in a very short period of time, making it hard to anticipate and prepare for how to best support your loved one. At the same time, you need to support your own emotional needs.\nCommunication is key in supporting each other. It is important that you are able to share with your loved one your own feelings and emotions about the experience while continuing to be empathic with the situation. The rewards of providing this emotional support to your loved one should not be ignored. Your loved one is vulnerable, scared, and uncertain about the future. You have been asked to accompany them on this journey. You are committed to them. You are improving their quality of life. You are vital to their physical and emotional well-being. Relationships grow while providing care, but only if you can talk with each other about the experience, the stresses, the highs, and the lows and maintain a plan of action and support together. It is important to explore other avenues for social, emotional, and spiritual support for both you and your loved one. It bears repeating; you do not have to do this alone.\n"

In this article, we will explore how these skills can help you manage your caregiving responsibilities and tasks while delegating responsibilities successfully to those who want to help. Using these skills will help make your caregiving experience a positive one for both yourself and your loved one.\nIf you are a planner, many of these skills may come naturally. Perhaps you work on planning your vacations a year in advance, researching all your destinations, using apps on your smartphone to map out activities, and sight-seeing opportunities. The same skills that help you plan your family's action-packed, memorable vacations, will aid you immensely in being a caregiver. If you aren't a planner, this is the time to build skills in organization.\nGo back to your loved one's care team and ask questions about the specific care needs s/he may require based on their diagnosis and treatment. These needs vary greatly based on the severity and length of their illness and treatments. You can also ask the care team to make referrals for skilled nursing care or home therapy services to assist in the physical (medical) caregiving needs your loved one may have.\nDo not forget to ask your care team about the emotional and mental health impact of the diagnosis. It is important for the caregiver to be prepared to cope with the emotional rollercoaster of an illness like cancer. Social workers can provide excellent guidance to caregivers, helping them to manage their loved one's emotional needs. Social workers can also provide supportive counseling to you and your loved one and help you manage (as a team!) any conflicts or issues that may arise during this challenging and life-altering time.\nGet Organized!\nCreate a caregiver organizer kit. A three-ring binder or accordion file works great. Keep all information about appointments, prescriptions, insurance information, bills, medical providers, and treatments in one place, such as a binder, which can travel with you to appointments.  You should also include a notebook in your \"kit\" to jot down questions you have before, during, and after appointments. You can also download free, fillable logs from Oncolink's Oncopilot.\nThis binder can be very helpful if different people will be taking the patient to appointments, giving them instant access to all the patient's information. In addition, the oncology team appreciates a prepared caregiver at appointments; it assures all questions are answered and they can ask someone who spends a lot of time with the patient for their take on how things are going.\nUse a calendar to organize all appointment dates. Many physician practices can print calendars with appointments for you. This can be especially helpful if you are seeing multiple care providers. Don't forget to mark your own \"blackout\" dates when you have other tasks to attend to (like your own doctor or dentist appointments). If you know ahead of time days you are not available, you also know when you may need tap into your support network for additional help. Sometimes it is helpful to record appointments (another great feature of the smartphone) to be able to listen to them later. Be sure to ask the care team if they are comfortable with you recording the interaction so that you can listen to it again and make sure you understand all the information that is provided in the appointment.\nCommunication & Flexibility\nDon't forget to engage your loved one in conversations about their caregiving needs. Remember that they are also losing aspects of their independence. This can be very troubling for individuals who have never had to rely on others for assistance. It is always a challenge to accept the need for assistance and then to ask for it. This is true for both the patient and the caregiver. Communicating about needs with each other is a key component to a successful caregiving relationship.\nIt is important to accept that things in this caregiving relationship may be beyond your control. Appointments will be changed or canceled. Treatment plans will be altered. Side effects may impact your loved one's quality of life. Flexibility in coping with these changes is of utmost importance. Work with the care team to be as proactive in preparing for these \"hiccups\" as you can be.\nCall on Your Team\nYou cannot and should not do this on your own. This is where your caregiving team comes into play. Likely many people have already said to you, \"what can I do to help?\". Instead of saying, \"nothing, I'm fine,\" keep a list (in your caregiver kit) of tasks with which you need assistance. For example, \"mom needs a ride to radiation on these dates,\" or \"I have a dinner date on Monday, could you come to prepare dinner for dad?\" This way you are prepared with a specific list and know exactly what you need to fill in gaps and maintain your own life and needs.\nYou can also use websites like Lots a Helping Hands, which provides online tools to help you manage caregiving needs. Another great online tool is Sign Up Genius, which enables you to build a customized sign up for anything you may need- from meals to housecleaning to a respite care schedule. MyLifeline allows you to build a page that provides updates on the patient's condition to friends and family, as well as creating a needs calendar and other helpful tools. Most people who are anxious to help you will appreciate being given a specific task to complete and will feel their own satisfaction in being able to help.\nRemember the phrase, \"it takes a village?\" Successful caregiving requires a group of people to support the primary caregiver. Use your networks, neighbors, church groups, friends, and family to help you flourish as a caregiver. This village will also help your loved one cope with their own illness and treatment and feel the love of a caring community.\n"

Compassion means \"to bear suffering.\" As we give more and more of ourselves in caregiving relationships, we also experience the suffering, the ups and downs, the good news and the bad news with our loved ones. Just being compassionate can be exhausting and when it becomes too much, caregivers can experience \"compassion fatigue.\"\nSymptoms of compassion fatigue may include\nSleep disturbances including hypersomnia (sleeping too much), insomnia (inability to sleep), nightmares, and interrupted sleep\nLess interest in caregiving duties\nFeeling more stress\nBeing traumatized by caregiving activities and functions\nIrritability\nDisinterest and resentment (in caregiving or towards the person you are caring for)\nSubstance use/abuse\nOften times, compassion fatigue can be described as feeling \"fried.\" When you feel fried, you doubt your abilities as caregivers. You may experience denial about the caregiving situation or your own abilities (or limits). You may feel discouraged and may disengage from those around you who care. Compassion fatigue is a common side effect of caregiving that can be prevented, or managed by making a commitment to caring for YOURSELF! This is known as 'self-care.'\nSelf-care techniques vary for each individual. What works for one, may not work for another. Studies have shown that the best technique for managing compassion fatigue is through physical activity and exercise. This doesn't mean you need to go out and train for a marathon. Find a physical activity you enjoy doing. Maybe it's bowling, walking around the neighborhood, biking, swimming, or tai chi. The important thing is to get moving, as exercise releases endorphins. Endorphins have properties that naturally relieve pain and distress. Endorphin release can also trigger better sleep and decreased anxiety, as well as boost our self-esteem.\nPerhaps you are an avid reader. Losing yourself in a book can be a wonderful way of caring for yourself. However, this can be difficult to do when you are trying to manage caregiving responsibilities. This is a great time to ask a friend or another family member to provide supervision, companionship, or other caregiving duties for your loved one. It is important to develop a caregiving support network to tap into for help so that you can take time to care for yourself.\nWhile it isn't always easy to do, you should not give up things that are important to you and your well being, for the sake of caregiving.\n"

As the number of cells grows, they form a tumor. Ovarian cancer that has spread from the ovary to another part of the body is called metastatic cancer.\nRisks\nReasons for getting ovarian cancer may be:\nOlder age.\nIf other women in your family have had ovarian cancer.\nGenetic changes such as BRCA1, BRCA2, HNPCC, MEN 1, Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, and Gorlin syndrome.\nHaving your first period at an early age.\nHaving more periods and ovulations, which are caused by a woman’s periods stopping later.\nNever being pregnant.\nHaving children after age 30.\nNever having used birth control pills.\nNever breastfeeding.\nScreening\nThere are no routine tests for ovarian cancer. There are a few tests that are being studied in women at high risk of getting ovarian cancer because of genetic changes.\nSigns and Symptoms of Ovarian Cancer\nWarnings signs of ovarian cancer are often ignored by the patient or the healthcare provider because they can be vague. Warning signs may be:\nFeeling swollen.\nPelvic or stomach pain.\nProblems eating or feeling full quickly.\nNeeding to use the bathroom more often or the feeling of needing to go happens quicker than normal.\nWhile these warnings are more often due to other health problems, women who have these should tell their healthcare provider, especially if they last for a long time.\nDiagnosis of Ovarian Cancer\nWhen your healthcare provider suspects ovarian cancer, they will order further tests like a pelvic exam, blood tests, transvaginal ultrasound, and surgery. Surgery is the only way to truly diagnose and stage ovarian cancer.\nStaging\nTo plan treatment, each woman’s ovarian cancer is given a stage and grade. The stage of the cancer is from 1-4, with 1 being the smallest size of tumor, and 4 being the largest size of tumor that has also spread to other places in the body. The stage is based on:\nSize and place of the growth.\nWhether cancer cells are found in the lymph nodes.\nWhether cancer cells are found in other places of the body.\n“Grade” means how different the cells look under a microscope. Grade 1 tumors look the most normal, while grades 3 and 4 appear less normal and may be more aggressive.\nTreatment\nOvarian cancer treatment almost always uses surgery to find, stage, and remove as much cancer as the provider can. The type of surgery will depend on the stage of the cancer and if the woman would like to be able to have children in the future. Surgery may also be done to ease problems from the cancer in its later stages.\nOther treatments might be:\n may be used after surgery to kill cancer cells or to keep cancer from coming back. In later disease, it may be used to help symptoms.\n may be used after surgery to kill cancer cells and stop the cancer from coming back (called recurrence).\nThis article is a basic guide to ovarian cancer.

They are in a woman's pelvis, connected to her uterus (the organ where a baby grows and develops when a woman is pregnant) by the fallopian tubes. The ovaries are each about the size of a marble, and they can often be felt by your healthcare provider during a pelvic examination.\nThe ovaries have two jobs in a woman’s body:\nThey make female hormones.\nThey make eggs.\nEvery month that a woman is fertile and not pregnant, her ovaries release a mature egg that travels into her uterus and could become fertilized. The ovaries also make estrogen and progesterone. These hormones regulate a woman's menstrual cycles, help the development during puberty, and keep a woman fertile.\nWhat is ovarian cancer?\nOvarian cancer happens when cells in the ovaries begin to grow out of control. These cells can also invade nearby tissue or spread throughout the body. Groups of these \"out-of-control\" cells are often called tumors. Some tumors are not cancer because they cannot spread to other parts of the body. These are called benign tumors or masses. The tumors that can spread through the body or invade nearby tissues are true invasive cancer, also called malignant tumors. \nMany ovarian tumors are benign (not cancer). Also, women (especially younger women) can get ovarian cysts, which are collections of fluid in the ovaries that can grow large or cause pain. Ovarian cysts are not cancer. Your healthcare provider may suggest that you have an ovarian cyst removed if it is big or painful. \nCancers are characterized by the cells from which they originally form.\nThe most common type of ovarian cancer is called epithelial ovarian cancer. This type comes from cells that lie on the surface of the ovary known as epithelial cells. Epithelial ovarian cancer makes up about 90% of all ovarian cancers and usually occurs in older women.\nAbout 5% of ovarian cancers are called germ cell ovarian cancers and start in the ovarian cells that produce eggs. Germ cell ovarian cancers are more likely to affect younger women.\nAnother 5% of ovarian cancers are known as stromal ovarian cancers and develop from the cells in the ovary that hold the ovary together and make hormones. These tumors can create symptoms by making too much of the female hormones.\nEach of these three types of ovarian cancer (epithelial, germ cell, stromal) has many subtypes of cancer based on how the cells look under a microscope. Talk with your provider about your exact type of ovarian cancer.\nA rare type of cancer, called primary peritoneal cancer, is a malignant tumor starting in the peritoneum (the lining of the abdominal [belly] cavity). It behaves like ovarian cancer, and they can look the same under a microscope. The treatments used are often the same as those used for ovarian cancer. This type of cancer can develop in women with or without ovaries.\n"

        "text": "What causes ovarian cancer and am I at risk?\nIn the U.S., about 21,410 women will be diagnosed with ovarian cancer each year. Ovarian cancer is quite rare compared to other cancers.\nNo one knows exactly why one woman gets ovarian cancer and another does not. The most important risk factor is age. The older a woman is, the higher her chances are of ovarian cancer. The median age at diagnosis is 63, although women with genetic or family risk factors tend to be diagnosed with ovarian cancer at a younger age. \nThe next risk factor for ovarian cancer is a family history of ovarian cancer. This is especially important if your family members are affected at an early age. If your mother, sister(s), or daughter(s) have had ovarian cancer, you are at an increased risk of getting ovarian cancer. It is estimated that 7% to 10% of all ovarian cancers are the result of hereditary genetic syndromes. Genetic mutations that increase ovarian cancer risk include:\nHereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer syndrome (HNPCC).\nMultiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN 1).\nBreast and ovarian cancer syndrome (associated with mutations in either the gene BRCA1 or BRCA2).\nPeutz-Jeghers syndrome.\nGorlin syndrome.\nSite-specific ovarian cancer syndrome (which produces an increased risk for ovarian cancer alone). \nIt may be helpful to test for mutations if you have a strong family history of breast or ovarian cancer (multiple relatives affected, especially if they are under 50 years old when they get the disease). Having a mutation doesn't always mean you are going to be diagnosed with ovarian cancer, but it does greatly increase your chances above the general population. If you do have a mutation, you can get more rigorous screening, take preventive medications, or have prophylactic oophorectomies (preventive removal of your ovaries) to decrease your cancer risk. The decision to have genetic testing is a highly personal one. You should talk with your healthcare provider and a genetic counselor who is trained in counseling patients about genetic testing and results.\nOther risk factors include being overweight, never having children or having them later in life, using fertility treatments, taking hormone therapy after menopause, smoking, and alcohol use. Keep in mind someone without any risk factors can still get ovarian cancer. Talk to your healthcare provider about your risk factors for ovarian cancer to their recommendations for screening and prevention.\nHow can I prevent ovarian cancer?\nIf you are a woman without a family history/genetic syndrome, the best way to prevent ovarian cancer is to change whatever risk factors you have control over. For example, having children by age 30 and breastfeeding both reduce risk. The use of oral contraceptives for 4 or more years is linked with lower ovarian cancer risk in the general population. Bilateral tubal ligation and hysterectomy also decrease ovarian cancer risk. Keep in mind that any medication or surgical procedure has its own risks and should be discussed with your care team.\nWomen who are carriers of one of the genetic syndromes listed above face different decisions. They generally need to have more rigorous screening done for ovarian cancer. They may want to take a medication, such as tamoxifen, to reduce their risk, and some may choose to have their ovaries removed when they are still healthy (called a prophylactic oophorectomy). This should only be done when a woman is finished having children. It can greatly reduce a woman's chances for getting ovarian cancer (but not reduce the risk to zero). Before a woman decides to do this, she should have genetic testing and counseling from a healthcare provider who has experience with genetic diseases.\nWhile a diet high in animal fats has been found to increase the risk of ovarian cancer, a diet rich in fruits and vegetables may have a small preventive effect. Supplementation with vitamins A, C, and E may decrease your risk. However, there are no official nutritional recommendations that can be made to prevent ovarian cancer.\n"

        "text": "What screening tests are used for ovarian cancer?\nIf you are at average risk for ovarian cancer, there are no recommended screening tests. However, you should have a gynecological exam as often as your provider suggests. Your provider may be able to feel your ovaries during a pelvic exam, and if any changes are felt, you may need further tests. Early ovarian cancers aren't usually felt on examination, and are often missed.\nThere are a few other tests that are currently being studied for ovarian cancer screening. One is a blood test that looks for a protein named CA-125. CA-125 is a protein that is shed from damaged ovary cells and is often high in ovarian cancer. There are a few problems with CA-125 as a screening test. The level can be high in many other diseases besides ovarian cancer, including other cancers, endometriosis, fibroids, menstruation, colitis, diverticulitis, pancreatitis, lupus, and inflammation of the lining of the lung or heart. \nOne possible way to use CA-125 for ovarian cancer screening is to check it and then re-check it 6 months later. If it greatly increases over this time, then ovarian cancer is more likely. The problem is that many patients without ovarian cancer will have elevated CA-125 levels and then have unneeded further workup (called a false positive). You could also have a false negative result, where the CA-125 is not higher, but there is actually cancer present and it goes unrecognized.\nAnother method for ovarian cancer screening is transvaginal ultrasound. Ultrasound is an imaging test that uses sound waves that bounce off of tissues and provide a picture of whatever is being looked at. By inserting an ultrasound probe into a woman's vagina, healthcare providers can get a good look at her ovaries. If the ovaries look abnormal, further tests can be done. The biggest problem with using transvaginal ultrasound for ovarian cancer screening is the same problem as using CA-125. Both tests cause too many healthy women to have unneeded procedures because the tests are not specific enough for ovarian cancer. In studies, combining CA-125 and vaginal ultrasound did not lower the number of deaths related to ovarian cancer, and therefore are not routinely recommended for screening.\nWomen with a strong family history or those with a proven hereditary cancer syndrome may need to get more rigorous screening with serial CA-125 tests and/or transvaginal ultrasounds, though the benefit to this is not clear. Talk to your healthcare provider about your ovarian cancer risk, and the best way to go about screening in your case.\n"

Experts worked together to develop the Ovarian Cancer Symptoms Consensus Statement, which describes important symptoms.\nThe symptoms that are more likely seen in women with ovarian cancer compared with healthy women include:\nBloating (feeling full).\nPelvic or abdominal (belly) pain.\nHaving a hard time eating or feeling full quickly.\nUrinary changes (urgency or frequency).\nWhile these symptoms are more often due to other medical problems, women with ovarian cancer report that the symptoms don’t go away and are a change from their normal. The frequency and number of these symptoms are also key factors in the diagnosis.\nOther possible symptoms include fatigue, indigestion, back pain, painful intercourse, constipation, and menstrual changes. Women who have these symptoms almost daily for more than a few weeks should see a healthcare provider (preferably a gynecologist) for testing.\n"

        "text": "How is ovarian cancer diagnosed?\nThe most common reason for a healthcare provider to suspect ovarian cancer is if he/she feels a mass during a pelvic examination. Ovarian cancer is a type of cancer that needs to be diagnosed and staged during a surgery. Often, the cancer is diagnosed and treated during the same procedure. Surgeries for ovarian cancer diagnosis and treatment should be done by a surgeon who specializes in gynecologic malignancies. Surgery is done so that samples of the mass and surrounding tissue can be biopsied and analyzed. A biopsy is the only way to know for sure if you have cancer, because it allows your healthcare providers to obtain cells that can be examined under a microscope. Once the tissue is removed, a healthcare provider called a pathologist will review the specimen. The pathologist can tell if it is cancer or not; and if it is cancerous, the pathologist will characterize it by what type of tissue it arose from and what subtype of ovarian cancer it is, how abnormal it looks (called the grade), and whether or not it is invading surrounding tissues.\nAlthough surgery is required for accurate staging, your providers may want to order some other tests to better characterize the mass/masses and look for distant spread. Tests like CT scans or MRIs can examine the pelvis and localized lymph nodes. Some patients with bony pain are referred for a bone scan, which is a test using a radioactive tracer to look for metastasis to any of the bones. You may also undergo a colonoscopy, which uses a lighted scope to examine your rectum and colon, or a barium enema in which dye is inserted into your rectum and an x-ray is taken. These tests are used to look for spread of the tumor to your colon. Each patient is unique, so the specific tests people get will vary; but overall, your providers want to know as much about your particular tumor as possible so that they can plan the best available treatments.\n"

The staging system used for ovarian cancer is the FIGO system (International Federation of Gynecologists and Obstetricians). Healthcare providers also use the TNM system (also called tumor - node - metastasis system). TNM describes:\nT: The size and local invasiveness of the tumor.\nN: Which, if any, lymph nodes are involved.\nM: If it has spread to other more distant areas of the body.\nThis is then interpreted as a stage somewhere from I (one) denoting more limited disease to IV (four) denoting more advanced disease. Generally, the higher the stage, the more serious the cancer.\nIn addition to stage, the tumor grade will also be evaluated. This refers to how abnormal cells appear under a microscope. Low grade (or grade I) tumors appear the most like normal cells, whereas higher grade tumors (grades 3 and 4) appear very abnormal under the microscope. Higher-grade tumors may behave more aggressively than low-grade tumors. The staging system for ovarian and primary peritoneal cancer is also applied to malignant germ cell tumors, malignant sex cord-stromal tumors, and carcinosarcoma (malignant mixed Müllerian tumors).\nThe staging system is very complex, and the entire staging system is outlined at the end of this article. Though complicated, the staging system helps healthcare providers determine the extent of the cancer, and in turn, make treatment decisions for a patient's cancer. The stage of cancer, or extent of disease, is based on information gathered through the various tests done as the diagnosis and work-up of the cancer is being performed. \n"

The purpose of surgery is first to diagnose and stage the cancer, as well as to remove as much of the cancer as possible. In early-stage cancers (stage I and II), surgeons can often remove all of the visible cancer. Generally, women with ovarian cancer will have a hysterectomy (removal of the uterus) and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (removal of both ovaries and fallopian tubes) as part of their operation. This is because there is always a risk of microscopic disease in both of the ovaries and the uterus. The only time a woman may not have this entire operation is if she has a very early-stage cancer (IA) that looks favorable under the microscope (grade 1). This is often the case with germ cell ovarian tumors. If a woman's tumor has these characteristics and she wishes to keep the ability to have children, then the surgeon can remove only her diseased ovary and tube. Then, after she is done having children, she will need to have her uterus and the other tube and ovary removed. With any other stage or grade of tumor, or in patients finished with childbearing, the entire operation should be done in order to provide the best chance for a cure.\nWomen who have more advanced disease (stage III or IV) will often have debulking surgeries. This means that the surgeon will remove as much disease as possible. Data collected in many studies has shown that the more cancer that is removed, the better the long-term outcome for the patient.\nSometimes, a patient will have debulking surgery and then later the cancer will come back (recurrence). It may be useful to debulk the tumor a second time, particularly if it has been at least a year between the first surgery and the recurrence. In patients with very advanced ovarian cancer, surgery may be used for palliation, meaning that patient is operated on with the intent of easing their pain or symptoms, rather than trying to cure their disease.\nOperations for ovarian cancer should be done by surgeons who are trained in dealing with gynecologic malignancies because there are special skills and techniques needed to deal with these tumors.\n"

        "text": "Chemotherapy\nEven if the tumors are removed during surgery, there is always a risk of recurrence because there may be microscopic cancer cells left that the surgeon cannot see or remove. In order to lower the risk of recurrence, a patient may have chemotherapy. Chemotherapy is the use of anti-cancer medications that work systemically (throughout the entire body) and are given intravenously (IV, directly into a vein), directly into the abdomen (intraperitoneal, “IP”) or orally(by mouth). Most patients with ovarian cancer will be offered chemotherapy as well as surgery (adjuvant chemotherapy). The higher the stage of cancer, the more important it is that you receive chemotherapy. Generally, only very early-stage cancers (early stage I) that look favorable under the microscope (grade 1 or 2) can be treated with surgery alone. Any woman with a more advanced stage or grade ovarian cancer should be offered chemotherapy.\nThere are many different chemotherapies used, and treatments often combine several medications to create a regimen. For the treatment of ovarian cancers, chemotherapy is often given intravenously (into a vein) or directly into the abdomen (intraperitoneal, \"IP\").\nSome of the chemotherapy medications used in ovarian cancer treatment include: cisplatin, carboplatin, doxorubicin, topotecan, ifosfamide, doxorubicin liposomal, docetaxel, paclitaxel, altretamine, capecitabine, cyclophosphamide, etoposide, gemcitabine, irinotecan, melphalan, pemetrexed, and vinorelbine. Most regimens contain a platinum compound chemotherapy, such as cisplatin, and a taxane, such as paclitaxel or docetaxel. \nHormonal therapies including aromatase inhibitors (example: letrozole), tamoxifen, and luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists (example:leuprolide acetate), are used more commonly in ovarian stromal type tumors, but not often in epithelial ovarian cancer.\nThere are also some targeted agents used in the treatment of ovarian cancer including bevacizumab, rucaparib, niraparib and olaparib. Bevacizumab is used to stop blood flow to the tumor and works best when given with chemotherapy. Rucaparib, niraparib and olaparib are used only for certain subtypes of ovarian cancer associated with BRCA mutation. Your care team will test the type of tumor you have to see if targeted treatment may be an option after other first line methods of treatment have not been successful. Olaparib and rucaparib can also be used to treat advanced cancer with or without mutations in the BRCA gene. \nIntraperitoneal (IP) chemotherapy is given directly into the abdomen through a catheter, allowed to \"dwell,” or remain in the abdomen for a while, coating the area in chemotherapy. This allows high doses of the chemo to be in direct contact with the cancer cells in the abdominal cavity. After several hours, fluid is drained from the abdomen, releasing the remaining chemotherapy from the abdomen. It is typically used in stage III cancers where the tumor has been optimally debulked (leaving nothing larger than 1cm). This can also be done at the time of the debulking surgery. \nThere are advantages and disadvantages to each of the different regimens that your  care team will discuss with you. Based on your health, your personal values and wishes, and possible side effects, you can work with your healthcare providers to come up with the best regimen for your cancer and your lifestyle.\n"

Radiation therapy is sometimes used with surgery in patients who have stage II tumors with low bulk disease. Radiation can also be used to ease the pain of metastases and/or to stop tumors from bleeding. Healthcare providers try to limit the amount of radiation that your vital organs receive, and don't like to treat large parts of the bowel and pelvis for this reason. This makes radiation less useful in ovarian cancer, where disease is often spread throughout the abdomen and pelvis. A radiation therapy team can answer questions about the process and side effects of radiation therapy in your particular case.\n"

At first, you will have follow-up visits often, usually every few months. The longer you are free of disease, the less often you will have to go for checkups. Your healthcare provider will tell you when they want follow-up visits, CA-125 levels, pelvic ultrasounds and/orCT scans, depending on your case. Your healthcare provider will also perform pelvic examinations. It is very important that you let your healthcare provider know about any symptoms you are having and that you keep all of your follow-up appointments.\nFear of recurrence, relationships and sexual health, financial impact of cancer treatment, employment issues, and coping strategies are common emotional and practical issues experienced by ovarian cancer survivors. Your healthcare team can identify resources for support and management of these challenges faced during and after cancer.\nCancer survivorship is a relatively new focus of oncology care. With almost 17 million cancer survivors in the US alone, there is a need to help patients transition from active treatment to survivorship. What happens next, how do you get back to normal, what should you know and do to live healthy going forward? A survivorship care plan can be a first step in educating yourself about navigating life after cancer and helping you communicate knowledgeably with your healthcare providers.

These cancers are treated in the same way.\nThe ovaries and fallopian tubes are part of the female reproductive system. The ovaries are two almond-shaped organs that house and release eggs for ovulation. They also make hormones. The fallopian tubes are found on either side of the uterus. The eggs travel from the ovaries to the uterus through the fallopian tubes. The peritoneum is the tissue lining the abdominal wall, covering the abdominal organs.\nWhat is surgical staging and how is it performed?\nStaging is a way to find out how far the cancer has spread in your body. Surgery can be used to help stage these cancers. Staging classifications include stages I through IV. The number of the stage will be higher in a larger cancer, one that has spread to lymph nodes, and/or moved to other parts of the body (metastasized).\nThe goal of surgery is to provide an accurate stage to develop a treatment plan and also to debulk (remove) as much of the cancer as possible. \nA woman may need more than one type of surgery to treat these types of cancers. These procedures can include:\nTotal Hysterectomy: Removal of the uterus and the cervix. The ovaries and fallopian tubes may or may not be removed. \nPartial/Subtotal/Supracervical Hysterectomy: Removal of the upper part of the uterus just above the cervix. The ovaries and/or fallopian tubes may or may not be removed.\nOophorectomy: Removal of the ovaries. Removal of one ovary is called a unilateral oophorectomy, removal of both ovaries is called a bilateral oophorectomy.\nSalpingectomy: Removal of the fallopian tubes.\nSalpingo-oophorectomy: Removal of the ovary and fallopian tube. This can be unilateral (one side) or bilateral (both sides).\nOmentectomy: Removal of the peritoneal tissue that surrounds the pelvic organs and contains blood vessels, nerves, lymph vessels, and lymph nodes.\nLymph Node Biopsy: Removal of a lymph node(s) to check for cancerous cells.\nPelvic and abdominal washings: During surgery, any fluid within the pelvis will be analyzed. The surgeon will, at times, \"wash\" the abdominal cavity with a liquid. This \"wash\" is sent to the lab for cellular evaluation to check for the presence of any cancer cells.\nOther Biopsies: Tissue samples from other parts of the abdomen and pelvis may be removed and sent to the lab for testing.\nDuring surgery, the surgeon will attempt to remove as much cancer as possible. This is referred to as debulking. The results of a debulking surgery are classified as: \nOptimal: Remaining tumors are no more than 1 centimeter in diameter.  \nSub-optimal: The remaining tumor is larger than 1 centimeter in diameter.  \nWomen who undergo a debulking may need to have other organs removed. These include either part of or the whole:\nColon.\nBladder. \nSpleen.\nGallbladder.\nLiver. \nPancreas. \nStomach. \nA hysterectomy can be done in a number of ways including:\nAbdominal: An incision (cut) in the abdomen is made to remove the uterus.\nVaginal: An incision (cut) is made in the upper vagina, and the uterus is removed through this opening. \nLaparoscopic: Many small incisions are made in the belly. A laparoscope (thin, lighted tube with surgical tools attached to it) is inserted through these cuts. \nRobotic: The surgeon controls a robotic arm to perform the surgery through small incisions.\nThe type of surgery you have will depend on factors such as what type of cancer you have, how far it has spread, and if there is a goal of preserving fertility. \nWhat are the risks/side effects of having a surgical staging for ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer?\nThe main side effect of a hysterectomy is the loss of fertility. The uterus is removed and menstrual periods will completely stop. If you keep the ovaries, you may not have menopausal symptoms since estrogen is still being made by the ovaries. If the ovaries were removed during surgery, menopause will happen. Your risk of developing osteoporosis, heart disease, and urinary incontinence is increased once menopause occurs.\nThe risks of surgery include:\nFever.\nInfection.\nBleeding.\nInjury to the urinary tract and/or surrounding organs.\nNerve damage.\nLymphedema (swelling). \nBlood clots.\nBowel obstruction.\nUrinary issues.\nSexual changes such as vaginal dryness and/or loss of interest in sex.\nWhat is recovery like?\nYou will need to stay in the hospital for three to seven days, depending on the extent of surgery you have had. You may have a catheter in place to drain your bladder of urine. You may need to go home with the catheter.\nEarly walking and deep breathing will be encouraged to prevent blood clots and pneumonia.\nYour medical team will discuss with you the medications you will be taking (blood clot and infection prevention, etc), pain management, and constipation prevention.\nAlthough your healthcare provider will discuss your particular activity restrictions, often it is advised that you:\nGet plenty of rest.\nAvoid heavy lifting.\nNo tub bathing, sexual intercourse or anything in the vagina (tampons, douching, etc). Bloody to light vaginal discharge is normal.\nDo not drive while taking narcotic pain medication.\nWomen generally can expect to recover from an abdominal hysterectomy in 4 to 6 weeks, whereas recovery from a vaginal hysterectomy is about 3-4 weeks.\nWhat will I need at home?\nThermometer to check for fever, which can be a sign of infection.\nLoose clothes and underwear.\nIncision care items.\nSanitary pads for vaginal bleeding/discharge.\nCare of Incision\nKeep the incision clean and dry. Follow instructions given to you for showering. \nIf you have drains, follow the directions given to you for care and emptying. \nWear loose fitting clothes to avoid incisional irritation. \nDo not apply lotions or ointments to your incision unless instructed by your healthcare team.\nCall your care team for any change in your incision including redness, swelling, drainage or opening. \nHow can I care for myself?\nYou may need a family member or friend to help you with your daily tasks until you are feeling better. It may take some time before your team tells you that it is ok to go back to your normal activity.\nBe sure to take your prescribed medications as directed to prevent pain, infection and/or constipation. Call your team with any new or worsening symptoms.\nThere are ways to manage constipation after your surgery. You can change your diet, drink more fluids, and take over-the-counter medications. Talk with your care team before taking any medications for constipation. \nTaking deep breaths and resting can help manage pain, keep your lungs healthy after anesthesia, and promote good drainage of lymphatic fluid. Try to do deep breathing and relaxation exercises a few times a day in the first week, or when you notice you are extra tense.\nExample of a relaxation exercise: While sitting, close your eyes and take 5-10 slow deep breaths. Relax your muscles. Slowly roll your head and shoulders.\nThis article contains general information. Please be sure to talk to your care team about your specific plan and recovery.\n"

        "text": "Genetic Testing for Familial Gynecologic Cancer (Endometrial and Ovarian Cancers)\nAuthor: OncoLink Team\nRead more about our content writing process\nLast Reviewed: \nWhat is Familial Gynecologic Cancer?\nGynecologic cancers are those that occur in female organs such as the uterus (endometrium), ovary, cervix, fallopian tube, vagina, or vulva. The two that can run in families are endometrial and ovarian cancer.\nEndometrial cancer can also be called “uterine” cancer. The endometrium is the innermost mucous membrane lining the uterus. \nThere is one ovary on each side of the uterus. The ovaries are glands where eggs form and where the female hormones progesterone and estrogen are made. \nFamily history is an important part of gynecologic cancer risk. As many as 5-10% of endometrial cancers and 25% of ovarian cancers are hereditary (familial). Hereditary cancer happens when changes or mutations in genes are passed down from your parents. These genetic mutations can cause family cancer syndromes, which can lead to cancer. However, just because there seems to be a family history of cancer does not mean there is a cancer syndrome or thatyou will get cancer. Testing for genetic mutations is one way to get an idea of your risk of developing cancer.\nWhat are the genetic mutations linked to gynecologic cancer?\nMutations of genes are like spelling errors in the genetic code of a gene. Those who have a gene mutation may be at higher than average risk for developing certain cancers. A genetic mutation that increases the risk of gynecologic cancer is present in some families. \n: These gene mutations are part of a cancer syndrome called Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC), also called Lynch Syndrome. As the name suggests, this syndrome raises your risk of colorectal cancer, but also raises your risk of developing endometrial cancer, ovarian cancer, stomach cancer, and several other cancers. Women with this syndrome have up to a 70% risk of developing endometrial cancer at some point.\nThese gene mutations cause Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer Syndrome (HBOC). This syndrome is linked to a higher risk of ovarian cancer, as well as breast cancer, fallopian tube cancer, and primary peritoneal cancer. There is also a higher risk of some other cancers, like pancreatic cancer and prostate cancer (only men have a prostate). Most inherited ovarian cancers are caused by mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. A mutation in the BRCA1 gene raises a woman’s lifetime risk of ovarian cancer to between 35% and 70%. A mutation in the BRCA2 gene raises a woman’s lifetime risk of ovarian cancer to between 10% and 30%. Women in the general population without a gene mutation have less than a 2% chance of ovarian cancer. \nThese gene mutations are part of a cancer syndrome called Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC), also referred to as Lynch Syndrome. Women with this syndrome have up to a 10% risk of developing ovarian cancer at some point.\nThis gene mutation causes a rare genetic syndrome called Peutz-Jeghers syndrome. This syndrome causes polyps in the stomach and intestines during the teenage years. People with this syndrome have a higher chance of certain cancers, including cancers of the stomach, esophagus, colon, and small intestine. Women with this syndrome have an increased risk of ovarian cancer. \nThis gene mutation also causes polyps in the colon and small intestine. People with this gene mutation have a higher risk of colon cancer, as well as ovary and bladder cancer. \nThese genes have been linked with ovarian cancer, as well as cancers of the breast and pancreas.\nWho should have genetic testing?\nIn a family with a history of ovarian or endometrial cancer, the first step may be to test a family member who has had one of these cancers. If that person is found to have a harmful genetic mutation, then other family members can be tested to see if they also have the same mutation. \nIf you are worried you or your family may have a genetic mutation or syndrome, you may want to talk with a genetic counselor. A genetic counselor will discuss what having genetic testing can mean for you and your family. The genetic counselor will go over the risks and benefits of testing and how results will affect cancer screening and prevention recommendations for you.\nIt may be recommended that you schedule a visit with a genetic counselor if you have:\nA strong family health history of breast, ovarian, or endometrial cancer.\nA moderate family health history of breast, ovarian, or endometrial cancer and are of Ashkenazi Jewish or Eastern European ancestry (Visit CDC.gov to find out if you have an average, moderate, or strong family health history of gynecologic cancer).\nA personal history of breast cancer and meet certain criteria (related to age of diagnosis, type of cancer, presence of certain other cancers or cancer in both breasts, ancestry, and family health history).\nA personal history of ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer.\nA known BRCA1, BRCA2, or other inherited mutation in your family. \nTalk with your healthcare provider about your unique case and possible gene mutations. There may be other reasons for genetic counseling, or your provider may strongly recommend testing your genes even without a family history of cancer. For example, the Society of Gynecologic Oncology (SGO) has recommended that all women diagnosed with ovarian or endometrial cancer should have genetic counseling, regardless of family history.  \nOncoLink: Genetic Counseling and Genetic Testing"

Tumor markers for ovarian cancer can be found in the blood. They are measured using a blood test. Having a high level of a tumor marker suggests that cancer may be present in the body, but by itself, a high tumor marker level is not enough to make a diagnosis.\nTumor markers may be used in conjunction with other tests (scans, biopsies, etc.) to help diagnose a patient who has symptoms suspicious for cancer, to predict prognosis after diagnosis, and to assist in making treatment decisions. Tumor markers are most often used to evaluate the patient's response to cancer treatment or to monitor for a recurrence (return of the cancer after treatment). A decrease in a tumor marker may indicate that the cancer is responding to treatment. If there is no change or the tumor marker increases, this may indicate that the treatment is not working or that the cancer has returned. These results must be evaluated in combination with radiology tests, physical exam, and the increase or decrease in any symptoms the patient may be experiencing.\nThere are some limits to the use of tumor markers. There are non-cancerous conditions that can cause tumor markers to be elevated, so these must also be considered when interpreting the test results. In addition, not everyone with ovarian cancer will have an elevated tumor marker. Your doctor will recommend testing for tumor markers only if you need them.\nCA-125\nUsed to help in diagnosis, assessment of response to treatment, and monitoring for recurrence.\nAlpha-fetoprotein (AFP)\nUsed in ovarian germ cell tumors.\nUsed to assess stage, prognosis, and response to treatment.\nBeta-hCG (Beta Human Chorionic Gonadotropin)\nUsed in ovarian germ cell tumors.\nUsed to assess stage, prognosis, and response to treatment.\nHE4\nHE4 can be used to help diagnose ovarian cancer in a woman with symptoms and may be more sensitive than CA125.\nIt can also be used to assess response to treatment and monitor for recurrence.\nInhibin A & B\nA hormone that is normally produced by ovarian tissue, but may be elevated in certain types of ovarian cancer (mucinous epithelial carcinoma, granulosa cell tumors).\nCan be used to assess response to treatment and monitor for recurrence.\nCEA (Carcinoembryonic antigen)\nCan be elevated in ovarian tumors and may be used to evaluate response to treatment.\nReferences\nFerraro S, Braga F, Lanzoni M, Boracchi P, Biganzoli EM, Panteghini M.

        "text": "Surgical Procedures: Surgical Staging for Ovarian (Epithelial), Primary Peritoneal and Fallopian Tube Cancer\nAuthor: OncoLink Team\nRead more about our content writing process\nLast Reviewed: \nWhat is surgical staging and how is it performed?\nOvarian epithelial cancer, fallopian tube cancer, and primary peritoneal cancer are gynecologic cancers that happen when cancerous cells grow on the surface of the ovary, lining of the fallopian tube, or the peritoneum. These cancers are treated in the same way.\nThe ovaries and fallopian tubes are part of the female reproductive system. The ovaries are two almond-shaped organs that house and release eggs for ovulation. They also make hormones. The fallopian tubes are found on either side of the uterus. The eggs travel from the ovaries to the uterus through the fallopian tubes. The peritoneum is the tissue lining the abdominal wall, covering the abdominal organs.\nWhat is surgical stagingand how is it performed?\nStaging is a way to find out how far the cancer has spread in your body. Surgery can be used to help stage these cancers. Staging classifications include stages I through IV. The number of the stage will be higher in a larger cancer, one that has spread to lymph nodes, and/or moved to other parts of the body (metastasized).\nThe goal of surgery is to provide an accurate stage to develop a treatment plan and also to debulk (remove) as much of the cancer as possible. \nA woman may need more than one type of surgery to treat these types of cancers. These procedures can include:\nTotal Hysterectomy: Removal of the uterus and the cervix. The ovaries and fallopian tubes may or may not be removed. \nPartial/Subtotal/Supracervical Hysterectomy: Removal of the upper part of the uterus just above the cervix. The ovaries and/or fallopian tubes may or may not be removed.\nOophorectomy: Removal of the ovaries. Removal of one ovary is called a unilateral oophorectomy, removal of both ovaries is called a bilateral oophorectomy.\nSalpingectomy: Removal of the fallopian tubes.\nSalpingo-oophorectomy: Removal of the ovary and fallopian tube. This can be unilateral (one side) or bilateral (both sides).\nOmentectomy: Removal of the peritoneal tissue that surrounds the pelvic organs and contains blood vessels, nerves, lymph vessels, and lymph nodes.\nLymph Node Biopsy: Removal of a lymph node(s) to check for cancerous cells.\nPelvic and abdominal washings: During surgery, any fluid within the pelvis will be analyzed. The surgeon will, at times, \"wash\" the abdominal cavity with a liquid. This \"wash\" is sent to the lab for cellular evaluation to check for the presence of any cancer cells.\nOther Biopsies: Tissue samples from other parts of the abdomen and pelvis may be removed and sent to the lab for testing.\nDuring surgery, the surgeon will attempt to remove as much cancer as possible. This is referred to as debulking. The results of a debulking surgery are classified as: \nOptimal: Remaining tumors are no more than 1 centimeter in diameter.  \nSub-optimal: The remaining tumor is larger than 1 centimeter in diameter.  \nWomen who undergo a debulking may need to have other organs removed. These include either part of or the whole:\nColon.\nBladder. \nSpleen.\nGallbladder.\nLiver. \nPancreas. \nStomach. \nA hysterectomy can be done in a number of ways including:\nAbdominal: An incision (cut) in the abdomen is made to remove the uterus.\nVaginal: An incision (cut) is made in the upper vagina, and the uterus is removed through this opening. \nLaparoscopic: Many small incisions are made in the belly. A laparoscope (thin, lighted tube with surgical tools attached to it) is inserted through these cuts. \nRobotic: The surgeon controls a robotic arm to perform the surgery through small incisions.\nThe type of surgery you have will depend on factors such as what type of cancer you have, how far it has spread, and if there is a goal of preserving fertility. \nWhat are the risks/side effects of having a surgical staging for ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer?\nThe main side effect of a hysterectomy is the loss of fertility. The uterus is removed and menstrual periods will completely stop. If you keep the ovaries, you may not have menopausal symptoms since estrogen is still being made by the ovaries. If the ovaries were removed during surgery, menopause will happen. Your risk of developing osteoporosis, heart disease, and urinary incontinence is increased once menopause occurs.\nThe risks of surgery include:\nFever.\nInfection.\nBleeding.\nInjury to the urinary tract and/or surrounding organs.\nNerve damage.\nLymphedema (swelling). \nBlood clots.\nBowel obstruction.\nUrinary issues.\nSexual changes such as vaginal dryness and/or loss of interest in sex.\nWhat is recovery like?\nYou will need to stay in the hospital for three to seven days, depending on the extent of surgery you have had. You may have a catheter in place to drain your bladder of urine. You may need to go home with the catheter.\nEarly walking and deep breathing will be encouraged to prevent blood clots and pneumonia.\nYour medical team will discuss with you the medications you will be taking (blood clot and infection prevention, etc), pain management, and constipation prevention.\nAlthough your healthcare provider will discuss your particular activity restrictions, often it is advised that you:\nGet plenty of rest.\nAvoid heavy lifting.\nNo tub bathing, sexual intercourse or anything in the vagina (tampons, douching, etc). Bloody to light vaginal discharge is normal.\nDo not drive while taking narcotic pain medication.\nWomen generally can expect to recover from an abdominal hysterectomy in 4 to 6 weeks, whereas recovery from a vaginal hysterectomy is about 3-4 weeks.\nWhat will I need at home?\nThermometer to check for fever, which can be a sign of infection.\nLoose clothes and underwear.\nIncision care items.\nSanitary pads for vaginal bleeding/discharge.\nCare of Incision\nKeep the incision clean and dry. Follow instructions given to you for showering. \nIf you have drains, follow the directions given to you for care and emptying. \nWear loose fitting clothes to avoid incisional irritation. \nDo not apply lotions or ointments to your incision unless instructed by your healthcare team.\nCall your care team for any change in your incision including redness, swelling, drainage or opening. \nHow can I care for myself?\nYou may need a family member or friend to help you with your daily tasks until you are feeling better. It may take some time before your team tells you that it is ok to go back to your normal activity.\nBe sure to take your prescribed medications as directed to prevent pain, infection and/or constipation. Call your team with any new or worsening symptoms.\nThere are ways to manage constipation after your surgery. You can change your diet, drink more fluids, and take over-the-counter medications. Talk with your care team before taking any medications for constipation. \nTaking deep breaths and resting can help manage pain, keep your lungs healthy after anesthesia, and promote good drainage of lymphatic fluid. Try to do deep breathing and relaxation exercises a few times a day in the first week, or when you notice you are extra tense.\nExample of a relaxation exercise: While sitting, close your eyes and take 5-10 slow deep breaths. Relax your muscles. Slowly roll your head and shoulders.\nThis article contains general information. Please be sure to talk to your care team about your specific plan and recovery.\n"

The uterus (womb) is the hollow reproductive organ found in a woman’s pelvis. It is where a baby grows during pregnancy. The ovaries are two almond-shaped organs that make and release eggs during ovulation. These eggs travel down the fallopian tubes and into the uterus, where if fertilized, will be implanted into the uterine lining. If the egg is not fertilized, a woman will get her period.\nA hysterectomy may be used to treat some cases of:\nCancers of the ovary, uterus, endometrium, and cervix. \nEndometriosis. \nAdenomyosis. \nChronic pelvic pain.\nAbnormal uterine bleeding. \nUterine fibroids and/or prolapse.\nThere are a few types of hysterectomy, including:\nTotal Hysterectomy: Removal of the uterus and the cervix. In some cases, the ovaries and fallopian tubes are not removed.\nPartial/Subtotal/Supracervical Hysterectomy: Removal of only the upper part of the uterus just above the cervix. The cervix remains. The ovaries and/or fallopian tubes may or may not be removed. \nRadical Hysterectomy: Removal of the uterus, cervix, tissue around the cervix, and the upper part of the vagina. The fallopian tubes may or may not be removed.\nDuring a hysterectomy, the decision may be made to leave the ovaries. At times, ovary removal may be done to lower the risk of getting ovarian and/or breast cancer. The fallopian tubes may be removed to lower the risk of fallopian tube cancer. In this case, the ovaries may not be removed.\nA hysterectomy can be done in many ways. These include:\nAbdominal: An incision (cut) is made in the abdomen to remove the uterus.\nVaginal: An incision (cut) is made in the upper vagina, and the uterus is removed through the cut.\nLaparoscopic: A laparoscope, a lighted tube with a camera, will be used.

        "text": "Surgical Procedures: Oophorectomy\nAuthor: OncoLink Team\nRead more about our content writing process\nLast Reviewed: \nWhat is an oophorectomy and how is it performed?\nAn oophorectomy is the removal of the ovaries. The ovaries are the two almond shaped organs that contain and release eggs for ovulation. They are also make hormones. This surgery can be done alone or with a hysterectomy. \nThe types of oophorectomy include:\nUnilateral oophorectomy: Removal of one ovary.\nBilateral oophorectomy: Removal of both ovaries.\nSalpingectomy: Removal of the fallopian tube(s).\nUnilateral salpingo-oophorectomy: Removal of one ovary and fallopian tube.\nBilateral salpingo-oophorectomy: Removal of both ovaries and their fallopian tubes.\nRemoval of the ovaries may be used to treat some cases of: \nOvarian cancer. \nEndometriosis.\nPelvic pain. \nPelvic inflammatory disease. \nTubo-ovarian abscess. \nNon-cancerous ovarian cysts. \nOvarian torsion.\nLower the risk of breast and/or ovarian cancers in women who are at a higher than normal risk.\nThere are different ways of doing an oophorectomy. The type used will depend on your situation.  \nSurgical approaches include:\nOpen abdominal surgery: An incision is made into the belly to remove the ovaries.\nLaparoscopic procedure: Many small incisions are made. A laparoscope, a lighted tube with a camera, is placed into one of these incisions. The ovaries will be removed through one of the small incisions in the abdomen.\nRobotic Surgery: The surgeon controls a robotic arm to perform the surgery through small incisions.\nIf you want to preserve your fertility, talk about your choices with your medical team. You may be able to keep one of the two ovaries, which in many cases will work normally, and natural conception is possible. If both of the ovaries are being removed, you should talk with a fertility specialist about your choices before having the surgery.\nWhat are the risks of having an oophorectomy?\nIf both ovaries are removed, menopause will start and side effects such as hot flashes and vaginal dryness may happen. Your risk of getting osteoporosis, heart disease, and premature death is greater once menopause starts due to ovary removal. Also, you may also have depression, anxiety, memory issues, and decreased libido.\nWhat are the risks associated with an oophorectomy? \nThere are risks and side effectsrelated to having an oopherectomy. Risks and side effects may be:\nBleeding.\nBlood clots.\nReaction to anesthesia. (Anesthesia is the medication you are given to help you sleep through the surgery, not remember it and to manage pain. Reactions can include wheezing, rash, swelling and low blood pressure.) \nNerve damage.\nInfection.\nHernia.\nScar tissue.\nInjury to the urinary tract and/or surrounding organs.\nBowel obstruction.\nWhat is recovery like?\nRecovery from an oophorectomy will depend on many factors. You may have to stay in the hospital. Early walking and deep breathing will be encouraged to prevent blood clots and pneumonia.\nYour medical team will discuss with you the medications you will be taking for blood clot, infection, pain, and constipation prevention.\nIf you underwent a laparoscopic oophorectomy you may have shoulder pain. This is a normal side effect and should go away within 1-2 days.\nYour provider will tell you what you should and should not do when you go home. This will often include:\nGet plenty of rest.\nAvoid heavy lifting.\nNo tub bathing, sexual intercourse or anything in the vagina (tampons, douching, etc) until instructed by your healthcare provider. Bloody to light vaginal discharge is normal.\nStairs as tolerated.\nDo not drive while taking narcotic pain medication.\nIf you have constipation, you can make changes to your diet, increase your fluid intake, and take over-the-counter medication. Straining to have a bowel movement should be avoided.\nAsk your provider if you should avoid taking aspirin as it may cause bleeding.\nWhat will I need at home?\nThermometer to check for fever, which can be a sign of infection.\nLoose clothes and underwear.\nIncision care items, often times supplied by the hospital/physician office.\nSanitary pads for vaginal bleeding/discharge.\nCare of incision\nLaparoscopic Incision Care:\nYour small incisions will be closed with stitches or a special glue. The incisions will be covered with bandages which can be removed in 24 hours. The stitches do not need to be removed and they will dissolve over time. Keep the incision clean and dry.\nOpen Abdominal Incision Care:\nIncisions should be kept clean and dry. Avoid tub bathing for at least 4 weeks or until your healthcare provider instructs otherwise. Showering is advised, but you should not scrub the incision. Allow the water to run over the incision with a mild soap and pat dry.\nAt times, drains may be left in place, making careful attention to gentle drying important.\nIf staples are present, they will be removed at your post-operative visit (approx. 10-14 days following surgery) at which time steri-strips (special tape) will be placed. It is ok to shower with either staples or steri-strips.\nWear loose fitting clothes to avoid irritating the incision. Avoid sun exposure to the incision.\nDo not apply lotions or ointments to your incision unless instructed by your healthcare team.\nFor both laparoscopic and open abdominal incisions, be sure to look for signs of infection including redness, swelling, drainage or separation (opening) of the incision and report these to your provider.\nWhen to contact your care team\nFever. Your care team will tell you at what temperature they should be contacted.\nNew or worsening pain.\nHeavy vaginal bleeding.\nFoul smelling vaginal discharge. \nNausea/vomiting.\nTrouble urinating.\nHow can I care for myself?\nYou may need a family member or friend to help you with your daily tasks until you are feeling better. It may take some time before your team tells you that it is ok to go back to your normal activity.\nBe sure to take your prescribed medications as directed to prevent pain, infection and/or constipation. Call your team with any new or worsening symptoms.\nThere are ways to manage constipation after your surgery. You can change your diet, drink more fluids, and take over-the-counter medications. Talk with your care team before taking any medications for constipation. \nTaking deep breaths and resting can help manage pain, keep your lungs healthy after anesthesia, and promote good drainage of lymphatic fluid. Try to do deep breathing and relaxation exercises a few times a day in the first week, or when you notice you are extra tense.\nExample of a relaxation exercise: While sitting, close your eyes and take 5-10 slow deep breaths. Relax your muscles. Slowly roll your head and shoulders.\nThis article contains general information. Please be sure to talk to your care team about your specific plan and recovery.\nReferences\nHealthline. Oophorectomy: What to Expect.

        "text": "Surgical Procedures: Pelvic Exenteration\nAuthor: Marisa Healy, RN, BSN\nRead more about our content writing process\nLast Reviewed: \nWhat is a pelvic exenteration and how is it done?\nA pelvic exenteration is the removal of a woman's uterus, cervix, ovaries, fallopian tubes, and vagina (the reproductive organs). There are times when the bladder, urethra and/or bowel, anus, and rectum are removed also. A pelvic exenteration may be used to treat some cases of gynecological cancers, such as recurrent cancers (cancer that comes back) of the uterus, cervix, vulva, or vagina.\nThere are three types of pelvic exenteration:\n: Removal of all reproductive organs and bladder. \n: Removal of all reproductive organs and bowel.\n: The bladder, urethra, rectum, anus, colon, and reproductive organs are removed. This requires the placement of two ostomies (holes), one for urine and one for stool.\nAn ostomy to help stool leave the body is called a colostomy. The part of the colostomy seen on the abdomen (belly) is called the stoma and will be covered by a collection bag.\nWhen the bladder and urethra are removed, a urinary diversion(a way to get urine to the outside of the body) will be made. During this procedure, your kidneys and ureters are connected to the urinary diversion, which will exit through the belly. There are two types of urinary diversions with stomas:\n: Uses a collection bag around the stoma.\n: You will need to place a tube (catheter) into the hole to drain the urine.\nSome women may choose to have surgery to rebuild or reconstruct a vagina. This surgery can often be done by a plastic surgeon at the end of your pelvic exenteration surgery. This new vagina is called a \"neovagina.” The neovagina is made by using skin and/or muscle from other parts of the body. Ways to make a neovagina include:\n: Skin taken from other parts of the body is used to make the new vagina. When using only skin grafts, vaginal stents are needed to keep elasticity (stretching) of the new vaginal tissues. These stents prevent shrinkage, scarring, or closure. At first, the stent will be worn all the time. You will then just wear it for most of the day for many months. Often, after a few months, women can either use a tube, dilator, or vaginal intercourse to keep the vagina open.\n: Muscle flaps and skin grafts can be used to make a neovagina. Muscle and skin from the lower chest and abdomen are often used. This is called a vertical rectus abdominis muscle flap (VRAM). Other muscle flap areas may be used as well. This procedure allows for better sensation and patency (keeping the vagina open). Although this neovagina will look like the pre-surgery vagina, the sensation and function will be different.\nA neovagina is not able to cleanse itself so you will need to douche to prevent vaginal discharge and odor. You will be told how and when to do this. Light bleeding or spotting after having intercourse is normal. Heavy vaginal bleeding is not normal, and you should call your care team if this occurs. Having an orgasm can be challenging.\nIf you don’t want a reconstructed vagina, it will be closed with skin.\nA pelvic exenteration is done using an up and down incision (cut) on the belly to access the pelvic organs. Drains will be placed. A catheter will drain urine and collection bags will be placed over the ostomy stomas. Bandages will also be placed on the abdomen (belly) and inner thighs if reconstructive surgery was done.\nWhat are the risks of having a pelvic exenteration?\nAs with any surgery, there are risks and possible side effects. These may be:\nBlood loss.\nReaction to anesthesia (Anesthesia is the medication you are given to help you sleep through the surgery. It helps you to not remember the surgery and it manages pain. Reactions can include wheezing, rash, swelling, and low blood pressure).\nInfection.\nWound separation (opening of the wound).\nAnastomotic breakdown (breakdown of the areas joining the stomas, colon, and/or ureters).\nFistula (hole).\nBowel obstruction (blockage).\nBlood clots.\nFlap and/or stoma necrosis (flap and/or stoma tissue death).\nLymphedema (swelling). \nChange in sensation (feeling).\nDecrease in quality of life.\nWhat is recovery like?\nThe hospital stay for a pelvic exenteration is often 7 to 10 days, depending on the surgery you have had.\nEarly walking and deep breathing will be help prevent blood clots and pneumonia. If a vaginal reconstruction was done, you will only be able to stand or lie on your back and side. You will be unable to sit for 6-8 weeks.\nYour care team will teach you about the medications you will be taking for blood clot prevention, infection, pain, and constipation, among others.\nYour healthcare provider will talk to you about any changes to your activity level while you are at home based on the extent of your surgical procedure. Often, a nurse will visit you at home to teach you stoma, drain, and incisional care.\nUntil your healthcare team advises otherwise, it is important that you:\nGet plenty of rest.\nWalk as tolerated.\nAvoid sitting for 6-8 weeks following vaginal reconstruction.\nAvoid housework and lifting.\nFollow vaginal dilation instructions and do not place anything other than what you are instructed into the vagina.\nWhat will I need at home?\nThermometer to check for fever, which can be a sign of infection. Your provider will tell you at what temperature you should call them.\nLoose clothes and underwear.\nIncision care items, often supplied by the hospital/provider's office.\nSanitary pads for vaginal bleeding/discharge.\nSymptoms to report to your healthcare team include:\nFever.

        "text": "Radiation Treatment for Gynecologic Cancers\nAuthor: OncoLink\nRead more about our content writing process\nLast Reviewed: \nRadiation therapy uses high energy x-rays to damage the DNA of cells. This kills the cancer cells, or stops them from reproducing. It is used to treat many types of cancer.\nRadiation therapy is often used to treat gynecologic cancers. Gynecologic cancer includes cervical, endometrial, uterine, fallopian, ovarian, vaginal, vulvar, gestational trophoblastic disease, and choriocarcinoma. The doses of radiation used to destroy cancer cells can also hurt normal cells in the treated area. The damage to these normal cells is the cause of the common side effects of radiation treatment. The possible side effects of radiation therapy are directly related to the area of the body being treated. If you are getting radiation for gynecologic cancer, possible side effects will happen in that area.\nWhat should I expect during treatment?\nThe side effects of radiation are cumulative, meaning the more treatments you have over time, the higher risk of side effects. Most patients do not have any side effects until a few weeks into their radiation treatment. While side effects may be unpleasant, there are treatments to help deal with them. Most side effects are temporary, going away over time once therapy is complete.\nYou will often have a visit with your radiation treatment team at least once a week. This visit gives you the chance to ask questions, discuss any side effects, and learn about any necessary interventions to help relieve the side effects. However, you can report any new or worsening symptoms at any time to your treatment team.\nShort-Term Side Effects\nThe following list includes some of the most common side effects of radiation therapy for gynecologic cancers, including external beam or brachytherapy treatments. Remember that the treatments can affect each patient differently, and you may not experience these particular side effects. Talk with your radiation oncologist and health care team about what you can expect from your specific treatment.\nSkin irritation: The skin in the treatment area may become red, irritated, dry, or sensitive. This may start to look like a sunburn after some time. Treat the skin gently to avoid further irritation, and bathe carefully, using only warm water and mild soap. Avoid perfumed or scented lotions or soaps, as these may cause further irritation.\nFatigue is very common with radiation treatment and tends to begin a few weeks into therapy. Fatigue often gets better slowly over the weeks and months following treatment.\nUrinary issues such as cystitis (inflammation of the bladder), dysuria (pain with peeing) increased frequency, urgency, hesitancy and increased nocturia (waking up at night to urinate). Talk to your healthcare team about ways to manage these symptoms.\nIrritation to the rectal tissue can cause bowel urgency, diarrhea or discomfort with bowel movements. These symptoms tend to get better within a few weeks of finishing treatment. Talk to your healthcare team about ways to manage these symptoms. In some patients, these problems can linger after treatment.\nNausea and/or vomiting can occur. Your healthcare team can prescribe medications to manage nausea. Dietary changes can also help.\nLoss of hair in the pelvic area. Hair typically starts to regrow a month or so after treatment. However, your hair might not grow back exactly as it was before treatment and for some, the hair loss becomes permanent.\nReduced blood counts, including neutropenia (low white blood cell count), anemia (low red blood cell count) or thrombocytopenia (low platelet count).\nLong-Term Side Effects\nThe side effects discussed above tend to happen during treatment, up until a few months after treatment. Long-term effects can happen months to many years after cancer treatment. The risks vary depending on the areas included in the field of radiation and the radiation techniques that were used, as these continue to develop and improve. Some of the potential long-term side effects of radiation for gynecologic cancers can be:\nThere is a low risk of developing a second cancer in or near the radiation field. These are called secondary cancers, and they develop as a result of the exposure of healthy tissue to radiation. Radiation techniques used today are meant to limit this exposure, but it is not always possible to prevent all exposure and still achieve the desired outcomes.\nRadiation therapy for gynecologic cancers can affect a woman’s fertility. Talk to your oncology team about options for fertility preservation if this is a concern.\nRadiation fields that include the uterus can decrease the size and elasticity of the uterus, increasing the risk of miscarriage or preterm birth. Women who become pregnant should be sure their obstetrician knows their treatment history, and is comfortable caring for a high-risk pregnancy.\nAfter radiation treatment to the pelvic area, scar tissue forms in the vagina and the tissue becomes less elastic and dry. There may be some shrinking of the vagina and vaginal opening. Scarring of the vaginal tissue can result in \"adhesions,” or areas where scar tissue forms, sealing the sides of the vaginal together. This can make it difficult for the healthcare provider to perform vaginal exams and makes sexual intercourse difficult and uncomfortable. Your oncology team will teach you to use vaginal dilators to reduce the severity of this side effect.\nDamage to the drainage (lymphatic) system in the area can lead to a chronic swelling called lymphedema, which can happen at any time after treatment. Learn about lymphedema risk reduction. Notify your healthcare provider if you develop any swelling in the legs or pelvis. A survivor with lymphedema who develops pain or redness in the leg(s), especially with fever, should be evaluated right away, as these signs may indicate infection.\nAfter treatment, talk with your oncology team about receiving a survivorship care plan, which can help you manage the transition to survivorship and learn about life after cancer. You can create your own survivorship care plan using the OncoLife Survivorship Care Plan.\nReferences\nAmerican Cancer Society. (2020). Radiation therapy for cervical cancer.

        "text": "Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy (IP Chemo)\nAuthor: Karen Arnold-Korzeniowski, BSN RN\nRead more about our content writing process\nLast Reviewed: \nSome cancers of the abdominal or gastrointestinal region can be treated using a type of chemotherapy infusion called intraperitoneal. There are two types of intraperitoneal chemotherapy. The first is used at the bedside in the hospital or in an outpatient facility. The second type is done in the operating room, after surgery to debulk (partial or total removal) a tumor. In this article, both types will be discussed.\nWhat is intraperitoneal (IP) chemotherapy?\nIntraperitoneal is described as space within the peritoneum. The peritoneum is the membrane (thin tissue) that lines the abdominal cavity and surrounds your abdominal organs. Chemotherapy can be administered directly into this space to treat cancers of the abdominal region such as gastric (stomach), appendiceal (appendix), and ovarian.\nThere are two types of IP chemotherapy. The first type is infused through a port in the abdomen and is administered in either the hospital or an outpatient (clinic) setting. The second type, referred to as Hyperthermic Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy (HIPEC), is administered in the operating room after surgery to debulk tumor tissue. The chemotherapy is warmed and infused directly into the intraperitoneal cavity.\nWhy is intraperitoneal chemotherapy prescribed?\nHigher doses of chemotherapy can be administered intraperitoneally as compared to through an IV (intravenously). By administering chemotherapy through this route you minimize the systemic (entire body) effects that can be caused by IV chemotherapy. IP chemotherapy is exposed only to your peritoneal cavity, minimizing side effects in the rest of the body. However, for IP chemotherapy to be effective, the surgeon must be able to remove (or debulk) the tumor(s) to a size of less than 1cm being left behind. The IP chemotherapy is unable to penetrate a tumor larger than 1 cm in diameter.\nDuring surgery to debulk a tumor, cancer cells may break off and still be in your body. Hyperthermic IP chemotherapy is administered to directly kill these cells after surgery. The chemotherapy is warmed because it is thought that heat helps break down and eliminate cancer cells more effectively. Also, the physician will manually disperse (move around) the chemotherapy in the peritoneal cavity with his or her hands or by repositioning the patient's body, which will allow it to get into the many crevices in the abdomen, where residual cancer cells could be hiding.\nStandard Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy\nPrior to IP chemotherapy being administered, a port must be placed to allow the medicine to be infused into the abdominal cavity. The port is placed in the abdomen during a surgical procedure, either in the operating room during surgery to debulk a tumor, or by an interventional radiology team if no surgery is being done or there are complications during surgery. The port is placed underneath the skin and then sutured to the ribs. You can feel the port under the skin. There is a tube that extends from the port, into the peritoneal cavity. Typically a port can be used just 24 hours after it is placed, as long as there are no complications and the port is functioning properly.\nPrior to your treatment, your nurse may place an IV or access your central line. You will have your labs checked. You may receive intravenous fluids and pre-medications, including anti-nausea medications and steroids. You will be prompted to use the bathroom or you may even have a foley catheter (catheter inserted into the bladder through the urethra to collect urine) placed. It is important to empty your bladder prior to your treatment as you will not be able to get up during the infusion, or the infusion would need to be interrupted. Lastly, your nurse will access your abdominal port by placing a needle directly into the port securing the needle. The nurse may or may not use a numbing medication prior to inserting the needle.\nOnce your port is accessed your nurse will start your infusion. Infusions can last anywhere from 30 minutes to 3 hours. The fluid infused may be only chemotherapy or a combination of chemotherapy and an IV fluid, depending upon the ordered medications. It is important that you remain still during the infusion to keep the needle from becoming dislodged from your port. You may be required to lay flat or keep your head and back only slightly elevated. Because you are lying flat and are having fluid introduced into a cavity within your belly the pressure of the fluid may press against your diaphragm and lungs and cause you to feel short of breath. You may also feel some discomfort, like a fullness after eating a large meal. It is important to notify your nurse if you become short of breath or the pressure is becoming intolerable.\nAfter your infusion is complete, the needle will be removed from your port. You will likely be instructed to change your position every 15 minutes for 1-2 hours. This is important so that the chemotherapy is evenly distributed within your peritoneal cavity. The chemotherapy will be absorbed into your peritoneal cavity. How often you receive IP chemotherapy will depend on your treatment plan.\nHyperthermic Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy\nDuring surgery to debulk a tumor, cancer cells may be left behind in the abdomen. HIPEC is administered to directly kill these cells after surgery. The chemotherapy is warmed because it is thought that heat helps break down and eliminate cancer cells more effectively.\nAfter your surgeon has removed as much of the tumor as they can, warmed chemotherapy will be infused into the peritoneal cavity. The chemotherapy runs through a machine to warm it and fills the peritoneal cavity. The chemotherapy is then manually dispersed (moved around) by a physician using his or her hands, or by manipulating the patient's position. The goal is for the entire abdominal cavity to be uniformly exposed to the heated chemotherapy. If there are any complications, such as bleeding or the patient becomes unstable, the chemotherapy is suctioned out of the peritoneal cavity and the patient is treated for the complication. The chemotherapy is manipulated for about 90 minutes. Then the chemotherapy remains in the peritoneal cavity and the surgical wound is closed. The chemotherapy is slowly absorbed into the peritoneal cavity (abdominal cavity).\nBenefits of Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy\nChemotherapy is administered in a way that allows it to directly affect the cancer cells, which studies have shown can improve survival in certain types and stages of cancer.\nPotentially fewer side effects in other areas of the body.\nA higher dose of chemotherapy can be safely administered than can be prescribed for intravenous use.\nTreatment using HIPEC may require only one round of chemotherapy, which is completed in the operating room.\nRisks of IP Chemotherapy\nSide effects can include nausea, vomiting, electrolyte imbalance, abdominal pain, and kidney injury. Some patients will experience low blood counts (called myelosuppression), which may be caused by the IP chemotherapy or IV chemotherapy given in conjunction with IP.\nOther side effects are possible based on the type of chemotherapy you are receiving. Your doctor or nurse will discuss the potential side effects related to the medications you will be receiving.\nThe need to lie flat for a prolonged period of time may be difficult for some.\nIssues with your port including infection, pain, and inability to infuse chemotherapy due to kinking of the catheter.\nThe penetration of chemotherapy directly into the tumor is limited, so the tumor must be debulked to less than 1cm in size.\nMetastasis beyond the peritoneal cavity may not be affected by IP chemotherapy due to minimal absorption into the bloodstream.\nPlease ask your provider-specific questions regarding treatment with IP chemotherapy. Always report any side effects during and after your treatment to your provider or nurse. Intraperitoneal chemotherapy is not an appropriate treatment for everyone so please consult with your provider.\nReferences\nAmerican Cancer Society. Chemotherapy for Ovarian Cancer. 2018.

Claghorn, M.S., R.D., L.D.N.\n\nRead more about our content writing process\nLast Reviewed: \nWhat is protein?\nProteins are large molecules in the body that do most of the work in our cells, and in effect, our tissue and organs. Proteins are made up of amino acids.\nWhy is protein important?\nProteinis needed for body maintenance, growth, and repair. Protein is present in almost all body cells and has many functions, such as:\nFormation and maintenance of muscles, connective tissues, red blood cells, enzymes, and hormones.\nTransporting many body compounds, as well as medications.\nMaintaining the balance of body fluids.\nFighting infections and strengthening immunity.\nGenerally, your diet provides enough protein; however, while undergoing surgery or treatment for cancer, your protein needs may increase. It is important to be aware of the food sources of protein and to include these foods at every meal and snack. \nWhat are my protein needs?\nTo come up with a quick estimate of your protein needs: \nDivide your weight in pounds by 2 (example: 180 pounds ÷ 2 = 90).\nThe result is about how many grams of protein you need per day (90 grams of protein).\n*If you are undergoing chemotherapy, radiation or surgery, the number of grams of protein needed each day may be higher.\nWhat are some food sources of protein?\nProtein is found in both animal and plant foods. \nAnimal sources of protein include:\nMeat (beef, lamb, pork). \nPoultry (chicken, turkey, duck).\nFish and seafood (crab, lobster). \nEggs.\nDairy products (milk, cheese, yogurt).\nPlant sources of protein include:\nNuts (almonds, pine nuts, walnuts, macadamia, peanuts). \nSeeds (sunflower, pumpkin, sesame).\nTofu. \nLegumes (dried beans, peas and lentils).\nGrains (cereals, breads and rice) and vegetables contain a small amount of protein. Fruits and fats do not provide any protein. The amount of protein in milk alternative products such as soy, rice, coconut and almond milk varies, so check the label of your product.\nWhat are some protein supplements?\nThe cheapest and most convenient protein supplement is dry skim milk powder. Add dry milk powder to any creamy foods such as smoothies, yogurt, milkshakes, coffee, ice cream, mashed potatoes, casseroles, scrambled eggs and creamed soups. add to the batter for cakes, cookies, pancakes, muffins, and puddings. Use pasteurized eggs substitute in shakes and recipes as a protein supplement, however, never use raw eggs due to the risk of salmonella contamination. \nProducts such as double strength milk, whey protein powder, pea protein isolate, soy protein, or hemp protein powders are good options to supplement your meals. A Registered Dietitian can assist with determining which protein supplement may best meet your needs.\nWhat if I amlactose intolerant?\nLow lactose milks (such as Lactaid®), cheeses, and ice cream are available. Individuals who are mildly lactose intolerant can often tolerate yogurt and fattier dairy foods such as cheese and ice cream. Milk alternates can be used instead of milk but it is important to note that protein content of these products varies and may not be the same as that of cow’s milk. Lactaid® pills, which contain the enzyme that digests milk, can also be taken before eating a dairy food and are available at most pharmacies. \nWhy is an adequate calorie and protein intake important?\nTo ensure that the protein you eat is used for essential body functions, you must get the calories your body needs. If you do not consume enough calories to maintain your weight, your body will use protein for energy rather than to support essential body functions. \nWhat are some high protein snacks?\nCheese with crackers, vegetables or fruit.\nTrail mix (mixture of assorted nuts and dried fruits).\nGranola, energy, protein and breakfast bars.\nCereal and milk.\nYogurt.\nCottage cheese or ricotta cheese with fruit or apple butter.\nChicken, tuna or egg salad on crackers.\nDeviled and hard-boiled eggs.\nHot cocoa (if using instant cocoa replace water with milk).\nPuddings and custards.\nRegular, flavored or malted milk.\nNuts.\nPeanut butter on crackers.\nHummus and pita bread.\nPizza bagel.\nDry roasted edamame.\nSandwich (meat & cheese, peanut butter and jelly, grilled cheese).\nMilkshakes.\nNutrition supplement drinks.\nHow can I add protein to food?\nShredded cheese - sprinkle over vegetables, potatoes, noodles, casseroles, soups, or salads.\nMilk - use in place of water when making soups, pudding, cocoa, or cooked cereals instead of water.\nMake double-strength milk - add 1 cup of nonfat instant dry milk powder to 1 quart (4 cups) of whole milk.\nIce cream, yogurt, and frozen yogurt - add to cereals, fruits, gelatin, pies, or milkshakes.\nHard-cooked eggs - chop and add to salads, vegetables or casseroles.\nLeft-over meat, chicken or fish - add to soups, salads or omelets.\nNuts and seeds - sprinkle over vegetables, fruits, salads, yogurt, cereal and pasta.\nBeans - add to salads, pasta, or soups.\nFoods with high protein content\nReferences\nU.S. Department of Agriculture: National Agricultural Library.

It is generally recommended that you consume at least 28 grams of dietary fiber a day to promote good bowel health. The major sources of dietary fiber are fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, seeds and dried beans.\nHowever, a common side effect of radiation treatment and many chemotherapies is diarrhea. If you experience treatment-related diarrhea, you should follow a low fiber diet and limit your intake of dietary fiber to about 10 grams a day. A low fiber diet is better tolerated with diarrhea because it will not stimulate the bowel as much and it will be easier to digest.\nFood labels list grams of fiber\nTo find out how much fiber is in a serving of a food use food labels. Look for \"Dietary Fiber\" in the list of nutrients. Choose foods that have 2 grams or less of dietary fiber per serving.\nSoluble fiber is a type of fiber found in some foods. Soluble fiber absorbs fluid and can help relieve diarrhea. Foods high in soluble fiber include:\nFruits: Applesauce, bananas (ripe), canned fruit, orange and grapefruit sections\nVegetables: Boiled potatoes\nBreads & pastas: White rice (see congee soup recipe below), tapioca, pearl barley and products made with white flour\nCereals: Oatmeal, cream of rice, cream of wheat and farina\nOther foods that can contribute to diarrhea\nFatty, greasy and fried foods\nSpicy and highly seasoned foods\nCaffeinated foods and beverages e.g. coffee, tea and chocolate\nMilk and milk based drinks\nAvoid chewing gum, as well as sugar free candies and gums that contain sugar alcohols such as sorbitol or mannitol\nFoods best tolerated when diarrhea is severe\nEat bland and easy to digest foods such as chicken, fish, eggs, puddings, mashed potatoes, noodles, rice, yogurt, cottage cheese, cream of wheat, farina, smooth peanut butter, white bread, bananas, applesauce, canned fruit and well cooked vegetables.

Vomiting or \"throwing up\" often goes along with nausea. Many things can cause nausea. While nausea with cancer therapy was common years ago, there are now many medications that can treat this side effect. If you have nausea and/or vomiting, talk to your oncology team about medications to manage this side effect. \nWhat causes nausea and vomiting?\nNausea and vomiting can be caused by treatments for cancer, cancer itself, and by the feelings and emotions related to cancer treatment. Radiation therapy to certain areas of the body, including the brain, abdomen, and head and neck, can cause nausea. Some medications used to treat cancer can cause nausea and vomiting. Anxiety-related to cancer and its treatments can lead to nausea. Changes to your normal bowel functions such as constipation and diarrhea can also cause you to feel nauseous.\nWhat can I do to prevent/better manage nausea?\nThere are a number of ways that you can prevent and treat nausea and vomiting. \nDrink 6-8 glasses of uncaffeinated fluid per day, such as broth, Gatorade®, Jello® (gelatin dessert), fruit juices, water ices, popsicles, soda, and ginger ale.\nEat dry, bland foods, such as crackers, toast, cereals, pretzels, and ginger cookies.\nEat cold foods such as cereals, salads, cold cuts, and desserts. The smell of hot foods can make nausea worse.\nEat 6 small meals throughout the day, instead of 3 large meals.\nChew food well.\nTry peppermint or ginger tea, flat soda, or ginger ale.\nTry to have others prepare your meals.\nRinse your mouth out often and before eating to avoid an unpleasant sour taste.\nSuck on mints, hard candy, or ginger candy.\nLoosen clothes, get fresh air and sit upright for 1-2 hours after eating.\nEat in cool rooms with fresh air.\nBreathe through your mouth slowly during times of severe nausea until the feeling passes.\nTake part in activities such as TV, radio, games, music to take your mind off the feeling of nausea.\nUse relaxation techniques and guided visual imagery.\nDiscuss hypnosis and acupuncture with your doctor or nurse.\nWhat things should I avoid?\nFatty, fried, greasy, or spicy foods.\nCitrus fruits, juices, and tomatoes.\nUnpleasant odors, sights, and sounds may make nausea worse.\nCombining hot and cold foods at the same meal.\nYour favorite foods during bouts of nausea and vomiting, so you will not associate them with feelings of nausea later on.\nDrinking liquids during meals can fill you up and not allow you to get in needed calories.\nExcessive activity and sudden movements.\nHow are nausea and vomiting treated?\nTreatment of nausea and vomiting will depend on its cause. Your provider may suggest:\nAnti-nausea medications to be taken before and after treatment.\nIf nausea occurs in the days/ weeks following treatment, it may be helpful to take an anti-nausea medication about 30 minutes before meals or consistently on a scheduled basis.\nAnti-anxiety medications can be taken to prevent or treat nausea and vomiting.\nIf you become dehydrated from nausea and vomiting, your provider may give you fluid by IV (intravenous).\nWhen should I call my care team?\nVomit that looks bloody or like coffee grounds.\nBlack stools.\nTemperature over 100.4°F (38°C).\nVomited two or more times in a day.\nBelly pain, cramping, or swelling.\nTrouble eating.\nTrouble drinking 6-8 glasses of fluid a day.\nLight-headedness, dizziness, or weakness.\nDark urine.\nNo relief after taking anti-nausea medications prescribed by your provider.\nIf you have any questions about nausea and vomiting or need more information, ask your care team. If you are experiencing nausea and vomiting and need help managing this side effect you should call your provider. \nReferences\nCancer.Net. Nausea and Vomiting. 2020. \nNational Cancer Institute.

        "text": "Peripheral Neuropathy (Nerve Damage)\nAuthor: OncoLink Team\nRead more about our content writing process\nLast Reviewed: \nWhat Is Peripheral Neuropathy?\nNeuropathy is irritation or damage to the nerves. Nerves are long, wire-like fibers in our body that transmit information from one area of our body to another. Peripheral nerves carry information from the brain and spinal cord to the skin, muscles, and organs. They carry sensations (feeling) of temperature, pressure, and pain to the brain and control the movement of your arms and legs. Peripheral neuropathy happens when a nerve or group of nerves has difficulty \"communicating\" with each other.\nWhat causes peripheral neuropathy and how long will it last?\nSome chemotherapy drugs can cause neuropathy, especially at higher doses or after many doses. Chemotherapy medications that can cause neuropathy include: vincristine, vinblastine, vinorelbine, Taxol, Taxotere, oxaliplatin, bortezomib and cisplatin.\nPeripheral Neuropathy can occur acutely- meaning during or shortly after receiving treatment and last a few days. It can also be chronic, that is, long-lasting and persisting between treatments. You may have tingling, a feeling of pins and needles, or numbness in your fingers or toes, especially in response to cold. The feeling of tingling can be triggered by eating, drinking, or touching something cold or even breathing in cold air.\nSymptoms often get better within a few days of treatment, but sometimes symptoms persist. For some, the peripheral neuropathy can become severe. It can lead to constant numbness in the hands or feet, especially for those who have had multiple doses of chemotherapy known to cause neuropathy. It can make it hard to carry out fine motor tasks with your hands, like buttoning a shirt, picking up small objects, and can cause problems with balance or walking. For people whose symptoms continue after treatment is complete, these often improve or resolve within 6-12 months. Some people do experience these symptoms for a longer period of time and for some, they become permanent.\nOccasionally during radiation therapy or surgery, injuries or scarring can occur, putting pressure on nerves and causing neuropathy. And, finally, tumors can put pressure on nerves or release substances that affect nerves.\nWhat are the common symptoms of peripheral neuropathy?\nWhen neuropathy occurs, one or several of your peripheral nerves has difficulty sensing information. This may lead to symptoms such as weakness, pain, imbalance, or numbness. These symptoms may make it hard to perform daily activities such as walking or dressing.\nCall your care team if you have any of the following symptoms of neuropathy:\nArms or legs feel heavy, numb or tingling, or feel like \"pins and needles.\"\nTripping, falling or pain when walking.\nDifficulty lifting up foot or toes.\nDifficulty picking up or holding objects, or manipulating them in your hand.\nDifficulty using buttons.\nCold feeling in arms or legs.\nIncreased sensitivity to hot and cold.\nWhat can I do?\nContact your care team right away if you have any of the above symptoms. Treating nerve damage early, potentially lowering the dose, or taking a break from the chemotherapy causing the problem may stop the symptoms from getting worse.\nWear gloves and warm socks, especially in winter.\n Since peripheral neuropathy may affect your mobility and ability to sense temperatures, it is important to take some simple precautions to ensure your safety. Ideas include:Always wear shoes both indoors and outside.\nIf you have neuropathy in your hands, use knives, scissors, box cutters, and other sharp objects with care.\nProtect your hands by wearing gloves when you clean, work outdoors, or do any repairs.\nMake sure your house is well lit.\nKeep a night light on in your room and along the path to the bathroom.\nCover steps and bathtub/shower with a non-skid surface.\nClear stairs and hall of objects.\nMark the edge of the step with a bright color to help determine where the step ends.\nUse handrails.\nTape down the edges of all throw rugs to avoid tripping.\nTest the temperature of the water with an area of your body that is not affected by neuropathy before any bathing and dishwashing.\nAlways check your feet and shoes at the beginning and end of each day. You may not feel small pebbles or poorly fitted shoes that can irritate your foot and cause an open sore. Look for any redness or blisters that you may not feel developing.\nIf you have pain, your provider may recommend medications that are used to treat pain caused by nerve damage, such as Elavil, Pamelor, Neurontin or Lyrica. These medications may have side effects and should be closely monitored by your care team.\nPhysical therapy can help with your balance, strength and safety. Braces may be needed to help with extreme muscle weakness and instability.\nOccupational therapy can help fine motor coordination, such as writing, and therapists can help adapt your home to account for the changes in your situation.\nIt is important that you speak with your care team if you feel that you have symptoms of peripheral neuropathy so that you can create a plan of how to manage it. \nReferences\nAmerican Cancer Society.

        "text": "Hair Loss (Alopecia) from Chemotherapy\nAuthor: OncoLink Team\nRead more about our content writing process\nLast Reviewed: \nA side effect of some chemotherapy medications is hair loss (alopecia). This article answers questions about hair loss and offers tips for coping with this condition. Are you looking for information on Radiation therapy and hair loss?\nWhy does chemotherapy cause hair loss?\nChemotherapy attacks cells in our body that grow and multiply quickly, such as cancer cells. Some normal cells that also grow quickly, like hair cells, are also affected. The damage to these normal cells is what causes loss of hair.\nDo all chemotherapies cause hair loss?\nMany chemotherapy drugs do not affect your hair. Others cause mild hair thinning or total hair loss. Your care team can tell you if you will lose any hair. Scalp hair is the most often affected. Loss of eyelashes, eyebrows, facial hair, pubic hair, and body hair can also happen. How much hair you lose depends on the chemotherapy drug(s) and dose, how it is given, and other treatments.\nWhen will the hair loss occur?\nHair loss often begins 2 weeks after your first treatment. Some people notice achiness or tingling of the scalp as the hair loss begins. If you lose all of your hair it may come out in big chunks and is usually done in 3-7days.\nIs the hair loss permanent?\nYour hair will often start to regrow after your treatment is done. Some people have a small amount of regrowth during treatment. Most people have significant hair re-growth 3-5 months after treatment is done. Your hair may grow back curlier and a slightly different color.\nCan I apply cold caps to my scalp to decrease hair loss?\nTalk to your provider about this option. Small studies have shown that products marketed as \"cold caps\" can reduce or prevent hair loss from chemotherapy in some patients. These work by decreasing the blood flow to the scalp, preventing the chemotherapy from affecting the hair follicles (where your hair is attached to your scalp). Some providers are concerned that this may also prevent the chemotherapy from reaching cancer cells that may be in the scalp area. \nHow should I care for my hair while receiving chemotherapy?\nIf hair thinning is expected, you can do these things to lessen the damage to your hair:\nUse a soft bristle hairbrush.\nUse a gentle, pH-balanced shampoo.\nAvoid using hairdryers, hot rollers, or curling/flat irons too often.\nAvoid bleaching or coloring your hair.\nAvoid permanent waves.\nAvoid braiding or placing hair in a ponytail.\nSleep on a satin pillowcase to decrease friction.\nIf your hair is long, cutting it shorter may help lessen the impact of your hair loss when it occurs.\nSome people find it easier to deal with hair loss by shaving their heads before hair loss starts.\nProtect your head with a hat to prevent sun exposure on sunny days- and not just in the summer months! This is important for men who are less likely to wear a wig or turban/scarf.\nShould I get a wig?\nEach person reacts differently when learning that they may have partial or total hair loss. There is no right or wrong response. Do what's comfortable for you. If you choose to purchase a wig:\nMake an appointment with a wig stylist before the hair loss is expected so that the color, style, and texture of your hair can be matched to a wig. If hair loss begins before your appointment with the wig stylist, save some pieces of your hair and take them with you. Or you can choose to get a brand new style.\nLearn about the types of wigs:Natural hair: Cost more and need more care.\nSynthetic: Less expensive.\nCan I get help paying for a wig for when I lose my hair from chemotherapy?\nSome health insurance policies cover the cost of wigs. They are called \"cranial hair replacement\" or \"cranial hair prosthesis.” You should contact your insurance company first to see if you have any coverage. You may need to ask your healthcare provider for a prescription to get reimbursement.\nSecondly, the American Cancer Society in some areas can help cover some or all of the cost of a wig. You should also see if your oncology office has a copy of the  \"TLC\" catalog from the American Cancer Society. They offer affordable wigs, turbans, and head coverings.\nConsider scarves, turbans, and hats.\nThey are cooler, can be more comfortable, and need less care than wigs. There are many attractive, stylish, and creative headcovers available.\nWhy am I so upset about my hair loss?\nIt is normal to be upset about hair loss from cancer treatment. It may affect how you feel about yourself. It is a reminder of your cancer. Share your feelings with your care team, family, and friends. There are many educational and supportive programs available.\nReferences\nCancer.net. 2020. Hair Loss or Alopecia. \nJAMA Oncology Patient Page. 2017. Chemotherapy-induced hair loss (alopecia) \n"

        "text": "Nutrition During Cancer Treatment\nAuthor: OncoLink Team\nContent Contributor: Carly Roop, RD, CSO, MA, LDN\n\nRead more about our content writing process\nLast Reviewed: \nGood nutrition is especially important for people with cancer. That is because the illness itself, as well as its treatments, may affect your appetite. Cancer and cancer treatments may also alter your body's ability to tolerate certain foods and to use nutrients.\nThe nutrient needs of a cancer patientvary from person to person. Your doctors, nurses, and dietitians can help you identify your nutrition goals and plan strategies to help you meet them. Eating well while undergoing cancer therapy can help you to:\nFeel better.\nKeep up your strength and energy.\nKeep up your weight and your body's store of nutrients.\nTolerate treatment-related side effects.\nDecrease your risk of infection.\nHeal and recover quickly.\nEating well means eating a variety of foods that provide the nutrients you need to maintain your health while fighting cancer. These nutrients include protein, carbohydrates, fat, water, vitamins, and minerals.\nNutrients\n: Protein helps to ensure growth, to repair body tissue, and to maintain a healthy immune system. Without enough protein, the body takes longer to recover from illness and you will have a lower resistance to infection. As such, people with cancer often need more protein than usual. Following surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy, additional protein is usually needed to heal tissues and to help prevent infection. Good sources of protein include lean meat, fish, poultry, dairy products, nuts, dried beans, peas and lentils, and soy foods.\n: Carbohydrates and fats supply the body with the bulk of the calories it needs. The amount of calories each person needs depends on his or her age, size, and level of physical activity. Sources of carbohydrates include fruits, vegetables, breads, pasta, grains and cereal products, dried beans, peas, and lentils. Sources of fat include butter, oils, nuts, seeds, avocado, dairy products, meats, fish, and poultry.\n: Vitamins and minerals help ensure proper growth and development. In addition, they allow the body to use the energy (calories) supplied in foods. A person who eats a balanced diet with enough calories and protein usually gets plenty of vitamins and minerals. However, eating a balanced diet can be challenging when you are receiving cancer treatment, particularly if treatment side effects persist for long periods of time. When that is the case, your doctor or dietitian may recommend a daily multivitamin and mineral supplement.\n: Water and fluids are vital to health. If you do not take in enough fluids or if you are vomiting or have diarrhea, you may become dehydrated. Ask your medical team how much fluid you need each day to prevent dehydration.\nYou can use the American Cancer Society Guidelines for Nutrition for Cancer Prevention below to help you plan what to eat each day. The guidelines serve as a general guide for healthy people that lets you choose a healthful diet. People with cancer, however, may have increased nutritional needs. For example, your doctor or dietitian may suggest increasing the number of servings of specific types of food.\nEat five or more servings of a variety of vegetables and fruits each day.\nChoose whole grains in preference to processed (refined) grains and sugars.\nLimit consumption of red meats, especially those high in fat and processed meats (examples include bacon, hotdogs, lunchmeats).\nChoose foods that help you maintain a healthful weight.\nManaging Side Effects That Can Affect Nutrition\nPoor Appetite\nChanges in your eating habits and a loss of appetite may occur as a result of cancer and its treatment. If this happens to you, try eating small, frequent meals and snacks every one to two hours. Keep high-protein, high-calorie snacks and foods handy to eat when you are hungry. Avoid food smells caused by food preparation.\nEat small meals or snacks every one to two hours.\nAvoid liquids with meals (unless needed to help swallow or for dry mouth) to keep from feeling full early.\nMake eating more enjoyable by setting the table with pretty dishes and flowers and playing your favorite music or watching television, and visiting with friends.\nKeep high-calorie, high-protein snacks on hand. Try hard-cooked eggs, peanut butter, cheese, ice cream, granola bars, nutritional supplements, puddings, nuts, trail mix, and yogurt.\nReview the tips on adding calories and protein to foods and include these in meals and snacks all during the day.\nAsk your doctor about medications to help relieve constipation, nausea, pain, or other side effects you have.\nWhen Things Don't Taste Right\nCancer and its treatments can cause changes in your senses of taste and smell. If you are having this problem, try foods or beverages that are different from ones you usually eat. Also, keep your mouth clean by rinsing and brushing, which in turn may improve the taste of foods.\nTry using plastic utensils if you have a metallic taste while eating.\nSeason foods with tart flavors such as lemon wedges, lemonade, citrus fruits, vinegar, and pickled foods. (If you have a sore mouth or throat, do not use this tip.)\nChew lemon drops, mints, or gum, which can help get rid of unpleasant tastes that linger after eating. (If you have diarrhea, avoid sugarless candies and gums.)\nFlavor foods with onion, garlic, chili powder, basil, oregano, rosemary, tarragon, barbecue sauce, mustard, ketchup, or mint.\nIncrease the sugar in foods to increase their pleasant tastes and decrease salty, bitter, or acid tastes. You may want to try honey or maple syrup.\nRinse your mouth with tea, ginger ale, salted water, or water with baking soda before eating to help clear your taste buds.\nServe foods cold or at room temperature. This can decrease the foods' tastes and smells, making them easier to tolerate.\nFreeze and eat foods such as cantaloupe, grapes, oranges, and watermelon.\nEat fresh vegetables, as they may be more appealing than canned or frozen ones.\nConstipation (bowel movement problems)\nPain medications, changes in your eating habits, and decreased physical activity can cause your bowels to move less frequently and stools to become more difficult to pass (constipation). If you have constipation, try eating high-fiber foods that can stimulate your bowels to move. Examples of high-fiber foods include whole grain breads and cereals, raw fruits and vegetables, dried fruits, seeds, beans, legumes, and nuts. In addition, drink plenty of fluids throughout the day, eat at regular times, and increase your level of physical activity.\nTry to eat at the same times each day. Establish a meal and snack schedule.\nTry to have a bowel movement at the same time each day to establish regularity.\nDrink 8 to 10 cups of liquid each day, if OK with your doctor. In addition to water, try fluids that have calories like prune juice, warm juices, teas, and hot lemonade.\nLimit drinks and foods that cause gas if it becomes a problem. These include carbonated drinks, broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower, cucumbers, dried beans, peas, and onions. To lessen the amount of air you swallow while eating, try not to talk much at meals, drink without straws, and avoid chewing gum.\nEat high-fiber and bulky foods, such as whole grain breads and cereals, fruits and vegetables (raw and cooked with skins and peels on), popcorn, and well-cooked dried beans.\nEat a breakfast that includes a hot drink and high-fiber foods.\nAsk your dietitian to recommend a high-calorie, high-protein, fiber-containing liquid supplement if you need more calories, protein, and fiber.\nUse laxatives only on the advice of your provider. Contact your provider if you have not had a bowel movement for 3 days or longer.\nSore or Irritated Mouth or Throat\nSome people with cancer may have a sore mouth, mouth sores, or a sore throat. If you have these problems, eating soft, bland foods and lukewarm or cool foods can be soothing. On the other hand, foods that are coarse, dry, or scratchy should be avoided. In addition, you may find that tart, salty or acidic fruits and juices, alcohol, and spicy foods may be irritating and should be avoided. Rinsing your mouth regularly with one teaspoon of baking soda and eight ounces of water or salt water can help prevent infections and improve healing of a sore mouth and throat.\nAvoid tart, acidic, or salty foods and drinks such as citrus fruit juices (grapefruit, orange, lemon, and lime), pickled and vinegary foods, tomato-based foods, and some canned broths.\nAvoid rough-textured foods, such as dry toast, granola, and raw fruits and vegetables.\nChoose lukewarm or cool foods that are soothing. Very hot or very cold foods can cause discomfort.\nStay away from alcohol, caffeine, and tobacco. These substances can dry out your mouth and throat and promote further irritation.\nAvoid irritating spices such as chili powder, cloves, curry, hot sauces, nutmeg, and pepper.\nSeason foods with herbs such as basil, oregano, and thyme.\nEat soft, creamy foods such as cream soups, cheeses, mashed potatoes, yogurt, eggs, custards, puddings, cooked cereals, ice cream, casseroles, gravies, syrups, milkshakes, and commercial liquid food supplements.\nBlend and moisten foods that are dry or solid with sauces, gravies, and casseroles.\nDiarrhea\nCancer treatments and medications can cause your bowels to move much more frequently and stools to become very loose (diarrhea). If you have diarrhea, you may need to avoid high-fiber foods, which may make the problem worse. These include nuts, seeds, whole grains, legumes, dried fruits, and raw fruits and vegetables. You should also avoid high-fat foods such as fried and greasy foods, as they can also promote diarrhea. In addition, stay away from gassy foods and carbonated beverages. Be sure to sip fluids throughout the day to prevent dehydration. Once the diarrhea has stopped, slowly begin eating foods containing fiber.\nDrink plenty of mild, clear, non-carbonated liquids throughout the day. Drink liquids at room temperature, as they are better tolerated than hot or cold beverages. Flat soda is another good choice.\nEat small, frequent meals and snacks throughout the day.\nAvoid greasy, fried, spicy, or other high fat foods.\nLimit milk and other lactose-containing foods.\nAvoid drinks and foods that cause gas, such as carbonated drinks, chewing gum and gas-forming vegetables (broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, Brussel sprouts and beans). You may drink carbonated beverages if you leave them open for at least 10 minutes before drinking.\nDrink and eat high-sodium foods such as broths, soups, sports drinks, crackers, baked chips and pretzels.\nDrink and eat high-potassium foods such as fruit juices and nectars, sports drinks, potatoes without the skin, and bananas.\nEat foods high in pectin such as applesauce and bananas.\nConsume white rice cooked in chicken or vegetable broth (this should be a thick porridge-like consistency). \nDrink at least one cup of liquid after each loose bowel movement.\nAvoid chewing gums, sugar-free gums, and all candies made with sorbitol.\nCall your doctor if diarrhea continues or increases, or if your stools have an unusual odor or color.\nWhen You Are Feeling Queasy\nSome people with cancer may experience nausea and vomiting. If you have these problems, be sure to take in plenty of fluids to prevent dehydration. Sip water, juices, and other clear, calorie-containing liquids throughout the day. You may tolerate clear, cool liquids better than very hot or icy fluids. When you have stopped vomiting, try eating easy-to-digest foods such as clear liquids, crackers, gelatin, and plain toast.\nEat six to eight small meals a day, instead of three large meals.\nEat dry foods, such as crackers, toast, dry cereals, pretzels or bread sticks, when you wake up and every few hours during the day.\nEat foods that do not have a strong odor.\nEat cool foods instead of hot spicy foods.\nAvoid foods that are overly sweet, greasy, fried, or spicy, such as rich desserts and French fries.\nSit up or recline with your head raised for at least 1 hour after eating if you need to rest.\nSip clear liquids frequently to prevent dehydration.\nAsk your doctor about medications that prevent or stop nausea.\nTry bland, soft, easy-to-digest foods on scheduled treatment days. Foods such as Cream of Wheat® and chicken noodle soup with saltine crackers may be better tolerated than heavy meals.\nAvoid eating in a room that is warm, or that has cooking odors or other smells. Cook outside on the grill or use boiling bags to reduce cooking odors.\nRinse your mouth before and after meals.\nSuck on hard candy, such as peppermint or lemon, if there is a bad taste in your mouth.\nDrink eight or more cups of liquid each day if you can. Drink an additional half cup to one cup of liquid for each episode of vomiting. Try sipping liquids 30 to 60 minutes after eating solid food.\nDry Mouth or Thick Saliva\nSome cancer treatments and medications can cause dry mouth or thick saliva. If you have either of these side effects, drink plenty of fluids throughout the day and eat moist foods as much as possible. In addition, brush your teeth and rinse your mouth regularly with baking soda and water or salt water to help keep it clean and prevent infection. Avoid commercial mouthwashes and alcoholic and acidic beverages because they can dry and further irritate the mouth.\nDrink 8 to 12 cups of liquid a day, and take a water bottle with you when you leave home. (Drinking lots of fluids helps loosen mucus.)\nUse a straw to drink liquids.\nTake small bites and chew food completely.\nEat soft, moist foods that are cool or at room temperature. Try blenderized fruits and vegetables, soft-cooked chicken and fish, well-thinned cereals, popsicles, and slushies. Avoid foods that stick to the roof of the mouth.\nMoisten foods with broth, soup, sauces, gravy, creams, butter, or olive oil.\nSuck on sour lemon drops, frozen grapes, popsicles, or ice chips. (Avoid chewing ice, as it can damage teeth.)\nKeep your mouth clean. Use a soft-bristle toothbrush; rinse your mouth before and after meals with plain water or a mild mouth rinse (made with one quart of water, one-half to one teaspoon of salt, and one teaspoon of baking soda); and floss regularly. It is a good idea to gently brush your tongue as well.\nAvoid commercial mouthwashes, alcoholic and acidic beverages, and tobacco.\nStay away from caffeine-containing drinks such as coffee, tea, colas, and chocolate.\nUse a cool mist humidifier to moisten room air, especially at night. (Be sure to keep the humidifier clean to avoid spreading bacteria or mold in the air.)\nWeight Gain or Weight Loss\nPeople going through cancer treatment can experience weight loss during times of decreased appetite or other treatment related side effects that affect the ability to eat. It is important to eat whatever works during this time to maintain body weight and protein stores. You may benefit from the use of liquid nutritional products during this time like Ensure®, Boost®, etc.\nWomen that receive breast cancer treatment can also gain unwanted weight during and/or after the treatment process. The reason for this weight gain is not clear but may be due to hormonal changes as well as decreased activity, depression, and other factors. While this side effect is disconcerting to most, it is helpful to know about it in advance. This way, you can adjust your eating habits accordingly if you begin gaining weight. Your dietitian can also assist you with modifying your diet to minimize weight gain.\nReferences\nAmerican Cancer Society.

        "text": "Paracentesis\nAuthor: Marisa Healy, BSN, RN\nRead more about our content writing process\nLast Reviewed: \nWhat is it?\nA paracentesis is a procedure done to remove excess fluid from the abdominal (belly) cavity using a needle. It is not normal to have fluid in this cavity, so any amount of fluid can cause you to have pain, discomfort, and a hard time breathing. The buildup of fluid in the abdomen is called ascites.\nThere are two reasons that a paracentesis may be done. These are:\nDiagnostic: Paracentesisis used to test the fluid and find the cause of the ascites. Ascites can be caused by infection, inflammation, trauma, cirrhosis of the liver, and cancer.\nTherapeutic: Paracentesis is done to relieve the symptoms and discomfort caused by ascites. In this case, the cause of the ascites is known.\nAscites is diagnosed based on your medical history, your physical exam, and diagnostic testing. Symptoms can include shortness of breath, discomfort, pain, and early satiety (feeling of fullness soon after you start eating). Your provider will palpate (touch with their hands) your stomach and may measure your abdominal girth (measurement around your stomach), and weight. You may have an abdominal x-ray, an ultrasound of your stomach, and an MRI or CT scan of your abdomen. These can all show a buildup of fluid.\nOnce your paracentesis is done and the fluid has been tested (if needed), your provider will let you know about the follow-up plan and further treatment options. Speak with your provider about any questions or concerns you may have.\nClick image to expand\nHow is it done?\nParacentesis can be done either in a provider’s office or in the hospital. Your provider will explain the procedure and have you sign a consent form. Tell your provider about any medications you are taking, any bleeding disorders you have, allergies, or if you may be pregnant. It is often recommended that you not eat or drink anything for 12 hours before the procedure. You should use the bathroom before the start of the procedure.\nA paracentesis takes about 10-30 minutes. You will be awake for the procedure. You should not have much discomfort or pain during the paracentesis. You may be asked to put on a hospital gown. You may receive pain and/or anti-anxiety medication before the procedure if needed.\nYou will be asked to lie flat on your back or to remain sitting up. If you are unable to lie flat, you may have your head raised slightly. Once you are in a comfortable position, your provider will ask you to stay still.\nAn ultrasound may be used to find the space where the fluid is easiest to reach. A cool or warm gel will be placed on the ultrasound probe, and you may feel slight pressure where the ultrasound is being used. This is not painful. Once your provider finds a good space to insert the needle, the spot will be marked.\nNext, the provider will clean the area where the needle will be inserted. This will most likely feel cold. A sterile drape may be placed around the area of the insertion site.\nThe area where the needle will be placed is then numbed. A small needle will be used to inject the local anesthetic (numbing medication) below the skin. The medication may cause a brief burning or stinging feeling. Your provider will wait a few minutes to make sure the area is numb.\nOnce the area is numb, your provider will insert a needle at the space that is marked. You may feel some pressure as the needle is inserted or you may feel a temporary sharp pain. If the pain does not go away, tell your provider. In some cases, a small incision (cut) may be made in the skin to insert the needle.\nThe fluid will drain through the needle, or a tube connected to the needle, into a container or test tube. The needle or tube will stay in as long as it takes to drain the amount of fluid needed either for testing or to relieve symptoms.\nOnce the fluid is drained, the needle will be removed, and a small bandage will be placed at the insertion site. If an incision was made, the incision will be closed with 1-2 sutures and then covered with a bandage.\nOnce the procedure is done, your vital signs may be monitored, and your abdominal girth may be measured. If you have had no side effects from the paracentesis, you can return to normal activity unless your provider tells you otherwise.\nWhat are the risks?\nRisks of paracentesis include:\nLeaking of fluid from the needle insertion site: This is normal and you may need to change the bandage a few times.\nBleeding.\nHypotension (low blood pressure): This can be a result of a large volume of fluid being removed and is treated with intravenous (IV) fluids and sometimes a transfusion of blood products (red blood cells). The infusion of fluid will help keep your blood pressure where it should be.\nPuncture of a blood vessel, bowel, or bladder: This is uncommon but may lead to the need for surgical repair.\nInfection: If the area appears infected (redness, tender or sore, pus or smelly drainage or if you develop a fever), call your provider. Infection can be treated with antibiotics.\nWhen should I call my care team?\nIt is normal for some clear fluid to drain from the needle insertion site, most often when a large amount of fluid was removed. You should call your care team if you have any signs of infection at the insertion site, including: fever, chills, redness, swelling, or leaking of foul smelling fluid. You should also call your provider if your abdomen increases in girth (feels more swollen or round), your pain does not get better with pain medication prescribed to you, or if you have chest pain, shortness of breath, blood in your urine, or uncontrolled bleeding from the insertion site.\nReferences\nAponte EM, Katta S, O'Rourke MC.

        "text": "FAQs About Lymphedema Garments and Bandaging\nAuthor: OncoLink Team \nContent Contributor: Andrea Branas, MSE, MPT, CLT, Joy Cohn, PT, DPT, CLT, and Christina Lombardi, PT, DPT\n\nRead more about our content writing process\nLast Reviewed: \nWhat is a compression garmentor bandaging?\nCompression garments and bandaging are designed to apply pressure to the affected lymphatic area to keep lymph moving in the right direction.  Research suggests that wearing a compression garment or bandage in conjunction with your overall treatment plan is effective in reducing and managing lymphedema. All of the garments are made of flexible fabric. Compression garments and bandages are designed to create the graded pressure that keeps the lymph moving in the right direction. \nWhat types of bandages and compression garments are used to treat lymphedema? \nThe bandages that are applied by your therapist duringComplete/Complex Decongestive Therapyare called \"short-stretch\" bandages. They look like \"ACE™\" bandages, but they are different. They are much less stretchy.  During Phase I of CDT, short-stretch compression bandaging is used with or without a foam pad/chip bag.  For the upper extremity, there are typically more layers further down on the limb and fewer layers higher up.  This creates a pressure gradient that helps fluid move up and out of the arm. The bandages should feel snug but not tight. \nDuring Phase II of CDT, wearing a compression garment or sleeve is typically recommended. Wearing a compression sleeve or garment may help to move fluid and prevent the buildup of fluid.  If you are getting a compression sleeve on your arm, ask your lymphedema therapist if you should wear a glove or gauntlet on your hand as well.  Sometimes, a glove or gauntlet is recommended as a precaution until you see how your body adapts to the sleeve.\nCan I use ACE™ bandages for my lymphedema? \nNo – you should not use ACE™ bandages to treat lymphedema. The elastic in the ACE™ bandages will create a tourniquet effect (will stop the flow of blood) on your limb, which may make your lymphedema worse. \nIf I have swelling, can I purchase a garment? \nIf you have swelling, it is best to have a doctor, nurse, or therapist examine you to determine whether or not you have lymphedema. If you have lymphedema, you should be seen by a Lymphedema Therapist to determine the best type of compression for you. Purchasing a garment without the help of a professional may lead to improper fitting and may potentially make your lymphedema worse. \nWhere can I get lymphedema bandages? \nYour therapist or healthcare provider will measure you.  It is SO IMPORTANT that your sleeve or garment is properly fitted by someone with experience. An improperly fitted sleeve can make lymphedema worse by placing too much or too little pressure on certain areas of the limb and ultimately worsen the lymphedema. Your therapist may be able to provide them. If not, your therapist should be able to direct you on where to purchase the sleeve.  Your therapist may recommend that you go to a durable medical equipment store.  At the store, a professional would also measure you and recommend the best option for you.  Your therapist may also recommend that you buy two sleeves or garments so you can alternate them for washings. \nWill my insurance cover my lymphedema garment?\nUnfortunately, it depends. You shoulder check with your insurance carrier for your specific coverage. For compression garments, a prescription is required from your doctor. If your insurance does not cover garments, you may have to pay out-of-pocket. \nYour therapist will direct you as to when you should wear your garment. Most likely, you will be instructed to wear your garment throughout the day. It is usually suggested that you put it on first thing in the morning and remove it in the evening.  \nCan I sleep with my garments? \nCompression garments should not be worn during sleeping at night. They can cause a tourniquet effect in bed and cause more swelling or limit blood flow. Compression garments are replaced by bandaging or specially made nighttime garments for sleeping. \nWhen do I need to replace my garments? \nYour compression garment MUST be replaced every 3-6 months. If you have been measured by a professional and have no changes in swelling, you can order them directly from the manufacturer. However, if your body part has changed size, you will need to be remeasured for a new garment.  Again, a is so important that healthcare professional measures you. Do NOT just buy another garment on your own. Also, it is recommended that you are measured again after your very first garment before ordering a new one. \nHow do I care for my garments? \nGarments must be washed AT LEAST every other day. Sweating can cause rapid breakdown of the garment, causing you to need a replacement sooner. Washing instructions are included with each garment. In general, hand OR machine wash with a mild detergent in warm water, then roll in a towel to squeeze out excess moisture (do not wring) and hang to dry. Use a mild liquid detergent. Some manufacturers make their own washing solutions as well. Garments dry better when hung in an airy location. Also, it is recommended that you do NOT hang outside as sunlight may cause a faster loss of garment stretch. \nWhat is the best way to put my garments on? \nHousehold rubber gloves should be used to correctly and safely put on your garment. The gloves protect the garments from pulls and snags caused by jewelry and fingernails. Gloves also allow you to 'smooth' or 'massage' the garment into place without excessive stretching or pinching and pulling. Put the garment on in stages as you have been taught, small sections at a time. \nFor a proper fit, align the fabric and seams so the lines run vertically (up and down the body part) and straight. DO NOT fold the garment over or let it roll. It is a common mistake to overstretch the garment when putting it on. If the garment is bunching up, use the gloves to spread the fabric down. \nCan I use a moisturizer before putting my garment on? \nUse skin moisturizer just before bandaging or after bathing and allow it to absorb well. Do NOT use it right before putting on your garment. Fabrics are less tolerant of lotions and ointments. Only use a light dusting of cornstarch if necessary to help the garment go on. Ointments with a petroleum base are NOT recommended as they can damage some elastic garments. If you have trouble slipping your garment on despite a slight amount of cornstarch, there are other options. Discuss these options with your therapist and your therapist will be able to advise you alternate ways. \nNext Article: Insurance and Lymphedema Treatment »\nReferences\nBreastCancer.org. 2020.

        "text": "Pelvic Physical Therapy for Oncology Patients \nAuthor: Megan Hernandez, PT, DPT, NCS\nRead more about our content writing process\nLast Reviewed: \nTreatment for cancer can cause a number of general side effects such as fatigue, changes in appetite, and pain. Patients who have cancers in the pelvis or abdomen can experience side effects that affect the bladder, bowel, and sexual function. These cancers include endometrial, cervical, ovarian, vaginal and vulvar in women, prostate cancer in men, and bladder, anal or colorectal cancers.  Pelvic floor therapy may be used to help manage some of these side effects.\nWhat is the pelvic floor?\nThe pelvic floor is a group of muscles that surrounds the vagina (only in women), anus and urethra (where urine comes out of). As the name suggests, the muscles make up the bottom of your pelvis. They act like a sling to support your rectum and other pelvic organs. If you are lacking strength, coordination, or the ability to relax any of these muscles, it can lead to:\nBack or pelvic pain.\nUrine or stool leakage (incontinence).\nConstipation or difficulty emptying your bladder.\nPain with intercourse in women.\nErectile dysfunction in men.\nYou can see these muscles in action by inserting a finger into the vagina or anus and feeling how the muscles squeeze around your finger. You can also try to stop your urine mid-stream or prevent gas from coming out. Relaxing these muscles allows for a bowel movement or emptying your bladder. Your pelvic muscles let you do all these things. \nWhat causes pelvic floor problems in people with abdominal or pelvic cancers?\nThe pelvic floor muscles can be affected by:\nScar tissue that forms after surgery for cancer.\nSurgery can cause tissues or muscles to shift or move.\nRadiation can cause scar tissue, hardening, or shrinking of muscles.\nIn some cases, the tumor itself can be affecting the muscles. \nWhat is pelvic physical therapy (PT)?\nDifferent from traditional PT, pelvic PT takes place in a private treatment room to allow the therapist to address your needs with privacy. The therapist will ask about your health history and bowel, bladder, and sexual issues that might have come up since receiving cancer treatment. Just like traditional PT, pelvic health physical therapists will also assess upper extremity, lower extremity, and core strength, range of motion, gait and functional stability, and posture. Pelvic floor PT focuses on the muscles of the pelvic floor. The best way to examine the pelvic floor is through an internal vaginal or rectal examination. If you are not comfortable with this, your PT can also view the muscles from the outside, or feel the muscles working over clothes.\nWhat treatments are used in pelvic floor therapy?\nAfter your physical therapist evaluates your pelvic muscles, they will suggest things to help improve your pelvic muscle function. This can include:\nMassage of tight muscles.\nExercises to strengthen your core and pelvic floor muscles.\nRecommending dietary changes such as avoiding alcohol or caffeinated beverages if you are experiencing urinary symptoms.\nRelaxation and deep breathing to relax the muscles.\nBiofeedback techniques.\nVaginal dilators for women with pain during intercourse.\nWhat is biofeedback?\nOne tool that many therapists use with traditional exercise, breathing, and massage is biofeedback. Biofeedback measures the electrical activity of your muscles using either external stickers or internal probes and displays this on a computer screen. This helps you see your muscles work, strengthens them, and improves your overall control of these muscles. \nYour physical therapist’s goal is to help you return to life after cancer. Whether that means having the energy to golf again, returning to work without fear of having accidents, or returning to intimacy with your partner. Treatment could involve one screening session before, after, or during your cancer treatment, or you can be followed closely to help you reach your goals.\nReferences\nOnujiogu N, et al.

The pelvis is found between the abdomen and the thighs. Within the pelvis are many bones including those of the lower spine, coccyx, hips, upper thighs and also contains organs including the reproductive organs and the rectum. Pelvic pain related to gynecologic cancers occurs mostly in the lower abdomen portion of the pelvic area.\nWhat causes pelvic pain?\nSurgery and radiation can be used to treat gynecologic cancers. These treatments can damage normal cells and tissue. This can lead to scar tissue that affects your nerves, joints, and muscles, resulting in pain.\nPelvic pain may:\nCome and go or be constant.\nFeel like an aching/burning, stabbing, or shock-like feeling.\nBe described as \"discomfort\" rather than pain.\nOccur at rest or with activity.\nThe pain may occur when you:\nWear constrictive clothing.\nSit for long periods of time.\nHave sexual intercourse.\nHave your period.\nUrinate or have a bowel movement. \nBecome constipated.\nPlease let your provider know if you have any discomfort that does not go away or disrupts your normal activity.\nWhat can I do about pelvic pain?\nThe first step is to talk with your provider about the pain. There are a variety of treatments that can be used to manage your symptoms. Treatment for each person may be different, based on your symptoms and what is causing your pain. Your treatment may include:\nExercise and specialized stretches.\nMedications.\nHormonal creams.\nVaginal dilators.\nAcupuncture.\nLubricants.\nIt is important to manage pelvic pain so that it does not interfere with your daily life. If one treatment does not seem to be helping speak to your provider about your other options.

Griffo RN, MS , Andrea Branas, MSE, MPT, Andrea Cheville, MD, Lora Packel, M.S.P.T.\n\nRead more about our content writing process\nLast Reviewed: \nTreatment for gynecological cancers can affect the body not only physically, but can also affect a woman emotionally, spiritually, alter self image, and affect sexual wellness and relationships. These changes are real and it is normal for a woman to have concerns after treatment for cancer.\nAs part of your healing after treatment, it is important to be aware and acknowledge how you are feeling and find ways to discuss these feelings with your partner, loved ones and healthcare team. It is important to understand and address concerns so that they do not have a long-term effect on you and those close to you. The following are some questions that may arise concerning sexuality and gynecological cancer. \nWill I be able to have sexual relations with my partner?\nA big concern for women following treatment is if they will be able to maintain what they believe to be a good quality of life, which for many, includes a satisfying sexual relationship. Following treatment most patients find that they are able to resume sexual relations with their partner. Often patients prefer to wait for the immediate effects of cancer therapy (fatigue, nausea, pain, etc) to subside before returning to normal sexual activity. During this period many couples maintain intimacy through touching, stroking, cuddling, and other \"outercourse\" activities.\nOnce you resume intercourse, you may find that your usual sexual techniques or positions are not comfortable. Experimenting either alone or with your partner can help you discover new methods. You have to find what works best for you. Be patient, and don't give up. It can take time to regain sexual arousal and satisfaction. It's important to let your partner know how you feel and what they can do to help. \nOf note, you should speak with your provider about when it will be safe for you to introduce anything into your vagina. You body may need time to heal after a surgical procedure or radiation. \nWill my sexual desire change?\nIt is possible that you and your partner may need to have less sexual activity for a period of time and to find different ways of expressing intimacy. There are many physical reasons for a decrease in sexual desire. The presence of pain can lead to a decrease in sexual desire. Treatment can reduce hormone levels that can lead to a decrease in desire. Other reasons include nausea or fatigue related to chemotherapy.\nEmotional issues can be a factor as well. Because of the physical change in your body, your feelings about yourself may change which may lead to a loss of desire. Becoming more comfortable with yourself and accepting of your physical changes is key. Remember that you as a person have not changed. Recognizing how you and your partner are feeling, and accepting these feelings, is part of the process of recovery. Many of the factors that contribute to a personal change in sexual desire resolve over time.\nWhat are the immediate effects of gynecologic cancer therapy?\nEveryone experiences some inflammation in the pelvis after surgery or radiation therapy. Muscles, nerves, and organs may all be affected. Irritation of the pelvis may cause every day activities such as urinating, having bowel movements, or walking to become painful. Women often find intercourse uncomfortable after treatment. Often these side effects lessen over time.\nRadiation treatment may cause a decrease invaginal lubrication, creating a need for externally applied lubricants. Surgical removal of or radiation of ovaries can decrease the production of estrogen (a female sex hormone). The loss of estrogen can cause shrinking, thinning, and loss of elasticity of the vagina, vaginal dryness, hot flashes, urinary tract infections, mood swings, fatigue, and irritability. Talk to your doctor about the possibility of hormone replacement therapy.\nOnce cancer therapy has ended, inflammation gradually subsides. Medications can be helpful in controlling discomfort until this occurs. The immediate effects of therapy may last up to three months and should diminish with time. If you continue to experience discomfort or other symptoms beyond this period, please tell your provider.\nWhat if intercourse is painful?\nA discussion with your provider can help to find the reasons for the pain and help you manage it. Painful intercourse may occur for a number of reasons. The vaginal lining may be thin or lack lubrication. Radiation therapy can cause the vagina to contract (shrink), limiting penetration during intercourse. The vaginal wall may be close to the bowel causing pain with some sexual positions. It is important to be open and honest with your care team so that this issue can be treated.\nCan I have children?\nPrior to receiving treatment, your care team should discuss with you your plans for having children in the future. Even if you are unsure or think that you don’t want to have children this is an important discussion to have because some treatments can cause you to be unable to have children in the future. If after treatment normal conception is not possible, you might be a candidate for assisted reproductive techniques.\nIs it normal to feel sad?\nYes, feeling sad is normal. Depression can occur as a result of your cancer experience. Your feelings about yourself and your life can change significantly during the experience. Depression can be treated with counseling and/or medication to help you regain a sense of control and enjoyment in your life. It is important to tell your doctor or nurse about how you feel so they can help you.\nHow will my partner feel?\nGynecologic cancer brings on many stresses for both you and your partner. It is very important to talk honestly with your partner. It is also important to acknowledge feelings you may have about the changes in your body. Just as you want your partner to understand and accept the changes you are experiencing, you will need to assure your partner that you accept their fears, concerns and feelings. This takes communication and work, but it can be done. If you and your partner are experiencing challenges with these conversations you can contact your care provider for recommendations for counseling.        \nSexuality can be a challenging topic for people to talk about. It is important to maintain open conversations with your loved ones and care team throughout and after treatment. \nReferences\nAmerican Cancer Society:\nSurgery Can Affect a Woman's Sex Life. 2020. \nPelvic Radiation Can Affect a Woman's Sex Life. 2020. \nTreating Sexual Problems for Women with Cancer. 2020. \nCancer Support Community. Ten suggestions to help you regain your desire for sex after cancer. \nMiller, DT et al. Addressing the Sexual Health Concerns of Women with Gynecologic Cancer: Guidance for Primary Care Physicians.

When you're presented with treatment options to save your life, thinking about what could happen ten or twenty years down the road isn't as much of a priority.\nSo what to do now?

You have taken the first step by developing a survivorship care plan. Some survivors may also benefit from a visit to a survivorship clinic. These clinics review your treatment history and develop recommendations for you and your primary care team based on your personal risks. Contact cancer centers in your area to see if they have a survivor's clinic or search for a clinic on OncoLink's survivorship clinic list (though this list is not exhaustive). \nAfter active treatment is complete, you will move into follow up mode. This usually means you will see your oncology team less often. For many, this can be a very scary time. The weekly or monthly visits to the oncologist are reassuring; someone is checking on things and giving you the thumbs up. Survivors are often surprised by their emotions at this time. You may anticipate jumping for joy and throwing a party. Instead, you may find yourself crying in the parking lot after your last treatment, feeling vulnerable in unexpected ways.\nYou may find it distressing that you are no longer getting active treatment. You may miss the much needed daily or weekly support you got from the oncology team. You may experience fear, sadness, anger, isolation, and grief. This is normal! You may also feel a sense of relief, gratitude, and be proud of yourself for getting through treatment – as you should!\nThe end of therapy is a time when friends and family may say, \"Congratulations\" and \"You must be glad to be done\", though you may be feeling uncertain about this milestone. Friends, family, and even the oncology team can be surprised by the complicated emotions you are experiencing. They may not realize that these emotions are common and even expected, which may make you feel even more isolated. You aren't alone. These are common reactions and the information in your care plan will help you transition to survivorship.\nFor starters, be assured that your oncology team is always there if you have any concerns. Plans for follow-up care have been developed to follow each person in the best way. This plan varies for every type of cancer and may involve periodic blood work, radiology scans and tests, and physical exams. You may only see the oncology team once or twice a year, but they are always a phone call away.\nAny time of transition in your life can be stressful. You must give yourself time to adjust to this new place. You may hear from others,  “it must be nice to be getting back to normal.” But as any cancer survivor will tell you, things have changed. So has your definition of \"normal\". Many survivors say they look at life differently; they don't take things for granted and don't sweat the small stuff. A cancer diagnosis changes you as a person, something people around you may not fully understand. It may be helpful to join a group of survivors, either formally (in a support group) or informally (gather a few folks you have met along the way). Email and the Internet have created a wonderful support for all sorts of concerns, and survivorship is no different. CancerCare\n provides online and telephone support groups and professional counseling. Many cancer centers and cancer service organizations offer support groups for survivors to address their specific concerns after therapy. A “buddy” program can match you with someone who’s been in your shoes and can be a listening ear and support person – or you can become a buddy to someone else. No one understands this time better than someone who has been there, and this support can be very valuable. Buddy programs are offered by Imerman Angels, Cancer Hope Network, and many other disease-specific organizations.\nFor many, a cancer diagnosis and treatment is a traumatic experience. Recovering from this trauma can be complicated by the late side effects of treatment. These side effects can impact your quality of life long after you have completed your cancer treatment. Some survivors experience symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder. This can include sleep disturbances, nightmares, flashbacks, avoiding places associated with the experience (like your treatment center), feelings of hopelessness, anger and guilt (including survivor's guilt), loss of interest in things you usually enjoy, and substance use.\nIt is important to find ways to cope with the trauma of cancer and your experiences. If you are having symptoms of post-traumatic stress, ask your care team for a referral for counseling. Your oncology social worker can help navigate your insurance and find an experienced provider who can give you support and therapy. Your team can also refer you for psychiatry support if medication treatment may be helpful in treating your post-traumatic symptoms.\nHowever, out of trauma, comes the possibility of post-traumatic growth. This is the ability to use challenging experiences to change and grow psychologically and emotionally. You may ask yourself, “how has cancer changed me?” Many patients have said, “cancer is the best thing that ever happened to me.” Cancer taught them to live. To appreciate the simple things in life. To love. To give back. To be close to others and show compassion. Even out of the most challenging experiences in our lives, there is room for growth, improvement, and change. After treatment, you may try new things, decide it’s time to take that trip you have always been wanting to do, join a spiritual community, or even find a way to “give back” through volunteer work, advocacy, and fundraising for a cancer service organization. All of these activities help you grow after cancer.\nSome cancer patients have depression and anxiety during and after treatment. Many patients express “scanxiety” when having their routine scans for follow-up. They worry about what the scans may show - “has my cancer come back?” This is normal after going through such an experience. It’s important to talk to your team if you are having these feelings. They do usually improve with time and with your improved abilities to cope with worry and fear. However, sometimes they don’t go away or even get worse. This is a time for concern. Signs of persistent depression and anxiety include trouble sleeping (insomnia) or sleeping too much (hypersomnia), hopelessness, inability or unwillingness to participate in normal activities, and even thoughts of self-harm or suicide. If you are having these symptoms, talk to your care team immediately.\n"

Or perhaps maybe, do I even need to tell them?\nDisclosure of your cancer history can be particularly challenging if you are thinking about dating and new intimate relationships after cancer. Chances are you have physical scars from your cancer treatment. You may also experience changes to your sexual health and function as a result of your treatment. A new partner may bring up questions about your ability to get pregnant or father a child. This is a lot for a cancer survivor to navigate. It’s important that you are comfortable “in your own skin.” Think about what you want to share with someone new in your life. Perhaps, give them small pieces of information to start to gauge their comfort level. If they ask questions about your scars, be prepared with what you want to say about them. Practice your talk with a trusted friend. Therapy after treatment can also help you strategize how to talk with a new partner about your cancer history and its long term impact on your life.\n"

        "text": "Survivorship: Late Effects After Radiation for Gynecologic Cancers \nAuthor: Carolyn Vachani, MSN, RN\nRead more about our content writing process\nLast Reviewed: \nWhat is a late effect?\nA late effect is a side effect that is caused by cancer treatment but happens months to years after cancer treatment has finished. Some side effects that you develop during treatment can last for months to years after treatment is completed (for example, fatigue or neuropathy). These are called long-term side effects. \nLate effects can be health issues or psychological, emotional, and practical challenges.\nLate Effects After Radiation for Gynecologic Cancer \nThe physical side effects of radiation treatment are directly related to the area of the body being treated. Any area in the treatment field has a risk of being damaged by radiation, causing side effects. As radiation techniques have improved over the years, the risk of late effects has decreased.\nImpact on Reproductive Organs, Sexual Function, and Fertility (for women)\nYou may have long-term changes to your vagina and uterus after radiation to your pelvis. You may experience vaginal dryness, atrophy (shrinkage and thinning of the tissues), less feeling/sensation in the genital area, bleeding, or painful intercourse. \nSexual Health\nWater-based lubricants and moisturizers (Replens) can help to make sexual intercourse more comfortable. \nRegularly applying vitamin E to external tissues or using suppositories to apply to vaginal tissue may help to strengthen the tissue and reduce friction and discomfort. Some women may benefit from low-dose estrogen suppositories.\nScar tissue in the vagina may cause the size of the vagina to narrow or shorten. Regular use of vaginal dilators, which are placed in the vagina for short periods of time, is recommended for all women who have had radiation to the pelvic area. This will help stretch the vaginal tissues and make intercourse and vaginal exams more comfortable. \nPhysical therapy to strengthen pelvic floor muscles has been shown to decrease pain with intercourse and improve sexual health. Women with pain in the vulvar region may find relief with topical lidocaine (a numbing agent).\nIf sexual health changes are affecting your quality of life, discuss them with your providers. You may find it helpful to see a therapist experienced in working with cancer survivors with sexual concerns.\nFertility and Childbearing\nRadiation fields that include the ovaries can result in damage to a woman's supply of eggs (oocytes). The risk of infertility is higher with higher doses of radiation. Your period will likely stop during treatment but may return in women younger than 40. If it returns, you may still be at risk of going into menopause earlier than your peers. This can be important to know for family planning purposes.If you would like to become pregnant, it can be helpful to see a reproductive endocrinologist. S/he can review the cancer treatments that you got and review options with you.\nAfter radiation to the ovaries, some women will go into early menopause (menopause that occurs before natural age). Early menopause can increase your risk for osteoporosis or heart disease. It may be helpful to see an endocrinologist even if you do not wish to become pregnant. They can discuss ways to reduce these risks, including hormone supplements, calcium, vitamin D, and exercise, depending on your case.\nRadiation to the uterus (womb) can cause the uterus to shrink, have less elasticity (ability to stretch) and develop scar tissue. These changes in the uterus can cause a higher risk of miscarriage, preterm labor, and babies born at low birth weight. If you wish to become pregnant, you should be followed by a high-risk pregnancy specialist.\nLymphedema Risk\nSurgery to remove lymph nodes or radiation to lymph nodes can cause damage to lymph nodes and lead to lymphedema. Lymphedema is swelling that can happen in the genital area, belly, buttocks, legs, or feet. It can cause pain, be disfiguring, make activity difficult, and increase the risk of infection in the area. \nTalk to your provider if you have any new or worsening swelling. A Certified Lymphedema Therapist (CLT) should be consulted at the first sign of swelling to try to keep the lymphedema from getting worse.\nAny area that has lymphedema or that is at risk for lymphedema is at high risk for infection. If you have any signs of infection, contact your care team right away or go to the emergency room. These signs include a sudden increase in swelling, an increase in pain, redness, the area is warm to the touch, or fever. \nBladder Problems\nRadiation to the bladder area can cause late effects to the bladder including:\nDeveloping scar tissue, which can lead to a decrease in how much urine your bladder can hold. \nIf given with chemotherapy medicines known to cause bladder damage (cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide), late effects can include hemorrhagic cystitis that causes bleeding from the bladder lining. Signs of hemorrhagic cystitis include urinary frequency (needing to go often) and urgency (needing to go right away), blood in the urine, and pain. You should report these to your provider right away.\nRadiation to the bladder may also make you more prone to urinary tract infections. This type of infection can be treated with antibiotics. If you have burning when urinating (peeing), frequency (needing to go often), or see blood in your urine, call your provider.\nRadiation to the bladder can increase the risk of developing bladder cancer. Signs of this include blood in the urine, urinary frequency, and urgency, urinating at night, and incontinence. Contact your care provider if you have any of these. \nThese late effects all have similar signs. You may have urine tests or cystoscopy (inserting a small tube with a camera into the bladder) to figure out what is causing your issues. It is best to not drink alcohol and or to smoke, as these irritate the bladder and increase the risk of bladder cancer.\nDamage to the Bones\nRadiation can cause small cracks (fractures) in the bones that are in the treatment field. Try to avoid trauma including falls or accidents. If you do get hurt, ask your provider if you need an x-ray to check for bone damage.\nBowel Problems\nThe bowel is sensitive to the effects of radiation. The late effects that may occur after radiation treatment that includes the rectum, colon, or small bowel include:\nScarring and strictures: Damage to the tissue of the bowel can lead to scar tissue. This scar tissue can cause a bowel obstruction. A bowel obstruction is when the normal movement of stool through the bowel is blocked. Call your provider if you are having any abdominal pain, constipation, vomiting, weight loss, or bloating. If you have severe abdominal pain along with vomiting and constipation you should be seen by a provider right away, either in the office or the emergency department. You may need to be admitted to the hospital for treatment.\nUlceration and bleeding: Ulceration and bleeding can be caused by damage to the bowel tissues. Report any dark/black colored stools, bright red blood in your stools, or in the toilet water, or on the toilet paper, to your provider right away. These can be signs of bleeding. You may need testing with a colonoscopy to find the area that is bleeding.\nChronic diarrhea: Report diarrhea that is causing weight loss to your care team. Medications to lessen diarrhea may be helpful. You may benefit from meeting with a gastroenterologist (GI Doctor). You should also meet with a registered dietitian (RD) who can help evaluate your diet and give you suggestions to lessen diarrhea and maintain or gain weight.\nFistula formation: A fistula is a connection (hole) between two parts of the body that are not normally connected. A fistula can form between the bowel and the bladder or the bowel and the skin. A fistula between the bowel and bladder can cause you to pass gas through the urethra (the tube that drains urine). If you have urine, feces, or blood coming out of any opening that it should not be, you should call your provider right away. \nColon cancer: Radiation to the bowel can lead to colon cancer years after treatment is complete. If you were treated before the age of 18, it is recommended to begin colon cancer screening with colonoscopy or DNA stool testing 5 years after treatment or at age 30, whichever occurs later. Screening for the general population begins between the ages of 45-50. You should consider these 2 guidelines when deciding when to start colon cancer screening. You may need earlier screening if you have irritable bowel disease, chronic diarrhea or bleeding, ulcerative colitis, colon cancer in your family, or previous gastrointestinal cancers or polyps.\nNerve Damage\nSurvivors who received radiation to the groin area can experience nerve damage. This damage is often a result of tissue scarring in the area and compressing on the nerves or interrupting the blood supply to the muscles served by these nerves.\nRadiation injury to the nerves and muscles is sometimes called radiation fibrosis syndrome. It tends to develop in the years following treatment and slowly worsens over time.\nSymptoms can include pain, loss of strength, decreased feeling (sensation), loss of coordination, or loss of movement or function of the muscle. The area affected will depend on the area that was in the radiation field.\nIn rare cases, the autonomic nervous system (ANS) can be affected. The ANS controls things you don’t think about, such as blood pressure and bowel and bladder control. Symptoms of ANS dysfunction can cause lightheadedness, fainting, extreme constipation, urinary incontinence, and erectile dysfunction.\nIf you develop any of these symptoms, report them to your provider. Some of these concerns can be caused by other health issues, so your provider will need to determine the cause.\nIf radiation fibrosis is determined to be the cause, you may benefit from seeing a cancer rehabilitation physician or physiatrist, and physical or occupational therapists. These specialists can help manage symptoms through therapy, medications, and assistive devices. \nSkin Problems\nRadiation can lead to permanent changes in the skin.\nYou may develop new scars or notice changes in the color or texture of your skin. Radiation can also change the color and texture of your hair or can cause permanent hair loss in the treated area.\nThe soft tissue and muscles under the skin can develop scarring and/or shrinkage, which can lead to a loss of flexibility and movement or chronic swelling in this area.\nYou may develop chronic or recurring ulcers of the skin in the area treated. Blood vessels of the skin may become dilated and more visible, although this is not harmful.\nIf the skin feels tight or sore, you can apply vitamin E to the skin.\nUse fragrance and dye-free soaps and moisturizers in the area if your skin is sensitive after radiation.\nSun Safety\nAfter radiation, the skin in the treated area is more sensitive to sunlight. This sensitivity will last for your lifetime. Practice sun safety, use plenty of sunscreen, wear a wide-brimmed hat, and keep skin in the treated area covered with clothing. Try to avoid being out in the sun between the hours of 10 am-4 pm when it is the strongest.\nIf you notice any new or worsening skin issues anywhere on your body, you should contact your provider for an assessment. \nManaging Late Effects\nIf you experience any concerning or lasting symptoms, contact your care team. Some side effects require specialized care from healthcare providers experienced in working with cancer survivors. Interdisciplinary survivorships clinics are available at many cancer treatment sites.  If a clinic is not available near you, talk with your oncology care team about resources for managing your late effects.\nAfter treatment, talk with your oncology team about receiving a survivorship care plan, which can help you manage the transition to survivorship and learn about life after cancer. You can create your own survivorship care plan using the OncoLife Survivorship Care Plan.\nReferences\nFeuerstein, M., & Nekhlyudov, L. (2018). Handbook of Cancer Survivorship, \n2nd. Ed.

        "text": "Healthy Living After Cancer\nAuthor: Marisa Healy, BSN, RN\nRead more about our content writing process\nLast Reviewed: \nCancer survivor, you may want to know what steps you can take to live healthier after cancer. There is no supplement or specific food you can eat to assure good health, but there are things you can do to live healthier, lower chances of developing other diseases, find new cancers early, and in some cases, lower your risk of cancer coming back (recurrence).\nSurvivorship Care Plans\nA survivorship care plan (SCP) is a great tool to learn about life after cancer. An SCP should have information about health issues (both long-term and late effects) that can be caused by the cancer treatment you had. This information should give ways to lower the risk of these health issues, any tests you should have to watch for the issue, and things to report to your healthcare team. An SCP may also provide resources and information about practical concerns, like fear of recurrence, financial issues, sexual changes, and more.\nYou can ask your care provider for an SCP or create your own at OncoLife.\nIt is important to have a plan for who will provide your cancer follow-up care (your oncologist, survivorship team, or primary care provider). After cancer treatment, this provider should:\nReview any scans or blood work.\nWatch for signs of your cancer coming back or a new cancer developing.\nManage any long-term or late side effects of treatment.\nIt is also important to have a primary care provider who can manage your non-cancer health concerns (like blood pressure, diabetes, etc.) and providepreventive care and screening (for example: checking cholesterol levels, getting a flu shot, and ordering routine screenings). While it is best if these providers know what the other is doing, it doesn’t always happen. Being involved in your own care helps your providers stay connected. You are the captain of your ship!\nUnfortunately, having one cancer does not mean you cannot get another cancer (either the same type or a different type). In fact, people who have had one cancer are at a higher risk to get another type, compared to someone who has never had cancer. It is important to follow recommendations for cancer screening tests. Learn more about what cancer screening tests are recommended for women and men. \nIn addition to these screening tests, your healthcare provider may also look for cancers of the skin, mouth, thyroid, and testicles during routine health exams (at any age). Not all screening tests are right for everyone. Your personal and family cancer history, and/or having an inherited genetic mutation, can affect which tests are right for you and at what age you should start having them. Your healthcare provider can help you find out what is best for you.\nHealthy Lifestyle\nFor some cancer survivors, surviving cancer is the reason to make healthy changes to their lifestyle. These can include things like quitting smoking, eating healthier, and exercising. These changes have been shown to lower the risk of getting new cancer or of certain cancers coming back. They can also help prevent or improve other areas of your health, including high blood pressure, diabetes, cholesterol levels, and more.\nSometips for living a healthier life:\nDo not use tobacco in any form. If you do, learn more on OncoLink and talk to your healthcare provider about taking steps to quit.\nKeep a healthy weight. Many studies have found that being overweight plays a role in 13 different types of cancer and increases the risk of some cancers coming back.Talk to your healthcare team about what a healthy weight is for you and take steps to reach and stay at that weight.\nTwo other important parts of a healthy lifestyle are eating a healthy, balanced diet and getting regular exercise.Experts recommend at least 30 minutes of moderate to vigorous activity per day, 5 days a week. Don’t let that stop you from getting started though! Start with what you can do and build up over time.\nEat healthy foods, including plenty of fruits and vegetables daily. Aim to have 2/3 of your plate filled with vegetables, fruits, whole grains and beans, while 1/3 or less should be an animal product. Choose fish and chicken and limit red meat and processed meats.\nLearn more about recommendations for diet, activity, and weight in the AICR's Staying Healthy After Treatment and the ACS's Eat Healthy and Get Active information on their website.\nLearn more about keeping a healthy lifestyle from Macmillan Cancer Support.\nLimit how much alcohol you drink (if you drink at all).\nHave regular check-ups by a healthcare professional.\nKeep up-to-date on general health screening tests, including cholesterol, blood pressure, and glucose (blood sugar) levels.Learn about health screening tests for women and men from the US Department of Health and Human Services.\nGet an annual influenza vaccine (flu shot).\nGet vaccinated with the pneumococcal vaccine, which prevents a type of pneumonia. Talk to your healthcare team to see if this vaccine is right for you. Learn more about adult vaccinations from the CDC.\nGet healthy sleep and reduce stress. \nDon’t forget your teeth and eyes!The American Dental Association recommends adults see their dentist at least once a year.\nThe American Optometric Association recommends adults have their eyes examined every 2 years until age 60, then once a year. People who wear glasses or corrective lenses or are at “high risk” for eye problems (diabetics, family history of eye disease) should be seen more often.\nIf you have any questions about your care after cancer, talk with your healthcare team about ways to live a healthy life and make a plan for screenings and scans.\nReferences\nAmerican Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO).

        "text": "General Cancer Screening for Women\nAuthor: OncoLink Team\nRead more about our content writing process\nLast Reviewed: \nCancer screening tests are designed to find cancer or pre-cancerous areas before there are any symptoms and, generally, when treatments are most successful. (Learn more about screening tests) Various organizations have developed guidelines for cancer screening for women. While these guidelines vary slightly between different organizations, they cover the same basic screening tests for breast, cervical and colorectal cancers, and are recommended to begin as early as the late teens.\nIn addition, during routine health exams (at any age) your healthcare provider may also evaluate for cancers of the skin, mouth, and thyroid. Not all screening tests are right for everyone. Your personal and family cancer history, and/or the presence of a known genetic predisposition, can affect which tests are right for you, and at what age you begin them. Therefore, you should discuss these with your healthcare provider. \nBreast Cancer Screening\nWomen ages 40-44 should have the choice to start screening mammograms after discussing the risks and benefits with their provider.\nWomen ages 45 to 54 should get a mammogram every year.\nWomen ages 55 and older should get a mammogram every 2 years, with the choice to continue getting them every year.\nContinue screening as long as the woman is in good health and expected to live 10 years or more.\nA clinical breast exam (CBE), performed by a healthcare professional, is no longer recommended.\nWhile monthly self-breast exams are no longer recommended, women should still be familiar with their normal breast tissue and report any changes in appearance, size, or feel of the tissue or nipples, or any nipple discharge to their health care provider.\nIf you have a family history of breast cancer or a personal health history that increases your risk (radiation exposure, genetic mutation, etc), speak with your provider about starting mammograms earlier, depending on your personal and/or family history. The American Cancer Society now recommends yearly breast MRI and mammogram for breast cancer screening in women who:\nCarry a known BRCA 1 or 2 mutation or have a first-degree relative with a BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene mutation but have not been tested themselves, \nThose with a lifetime risk of breast cancer that is higher due to a family history of breast cancer. \nHave Li-Fraumeni, Cowden, or Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndromes or a first-degree relative with one of them. \nTalk with your healthcare provider about your personal history and whether you should have additional tests at an earlier age. For more information, see the ACS website, Breast Cancer Prevention and Early Detection.\nThe American Cancer Society recommends the following guidelines for cervical cancer screening:\nAll women should begin cervical cancer screening at age 25.\nWomen between the ages of 25 and 65 should have:Primary HPV testing every 5 years. This test is not yet available at many centers/practices.\nIf this test is not available, you should be screened with co-testing, which is a combination of an HPV and Pap test. This should be done every 5 years.\nIf HPV testing is not available, then a Pap test alone should be performed every three years.\nWomen over age 65 who have had regular cervical screenings that were normal should not be screened for cervical cancer. \nWomen who have been diagnosed with cervical pre-cancer should continue to be screened until they meet one of the following criteria over the previous 10 years:Two negative, consecutive HPV tests.\nOr 2 negative, consecutive co-tests.\nOr 3 negative, consecutive pap tests in the last 3-5 years.\nWomen who have had their uterus and cervix removed in a hysterectomy and have no history of cervical cancer or pre-cancer should not be screened.\nWomen who have had the HPV vaccine should still follow the screening recommendations for their age group.\nWhile the ACS does not recommend cervical cancer screening every year, women should still see their provider for a well-woman checkup.\nWomen who are at high risk for cervical cancer may need to be screened more often. Women at high risk might include those with HIV infection, organ transplant, or in-utero exposure to the drug DES. They should talk with their doctor or nurse for specific recommendations.\nThe ACS recommends that at the time of menopause, all women should be informed about the risks and symptoms of endometrial cancer. Women should report any unexpected bleeding or spotting to their doctors. Some women, because of their history, especially those with a history of hereditary non-polyposis colon cancer, may want to consider having a yearly endometrial biopsy starting at age 35. Please talk with your provider about your past medical and gynecologic history to determine whether you are at increased risk for endometrial cancer.\nMost men and women over the age of 45-50 should undergo routine screening for colon and rectal cancer, up until age 75. The American Cancer Society suggests starting screening at age 45 whereas the United States Preventive Services Task Force suggests starting at age 50. Insurance may not cover screening before the age of 50 so you should talk with your provider and insurance company before screening. Testing may be appropriate for younger people with a high-risk personal or family health history. \nOptions for colon cancer screening can be divided into those that screen for both cancer and polyps, and those that just screen for cancer. Tests that screen for cancer and polyps include flexible sigmoidoscopy, colonoscopy, double-contrast barium enema, or CT colonography (virtual colonoscopy). Tests that screen mainly for cancer include stool testing for blood, or stool DNA testing. Learn more about colorectal cancer screening options on OncoLink.\nThe \"preferred screening\" recommended by the American College of Gastroenterologists is a colonoscopy every 10 years. The ACS recommends screening beginning at age 45 (unless you are considered \"high risk,\" see below), using one of the following testing schedules:\nTests that find polyps and cancer:\n(Preferred over those that find cancer alone\n. If any of these tests are positive, a colonoscopy should be done.)\nFlexible sigmoidoscopy every 5 years, or\nColonoscopy every 10 years, or\nCT colonography (virtual colonoscopy) every 5 years\nTests that primarily test for cancer:\nYearly guaiac-based fecal occult blood test (FOBT)*, or\nYearly fecal immunochemical test (FIT) *, or\nStool DNA test (sDNA), every 3 years*\n*The multiple stool take-home test should be used. One test done by the doctor in the office is not adequate for testing. A colonoscopy should be done if the test is positive.\nIndividuals at higher risk of colon cancer should have screening earlier and potentially more frequently. Individuals at higher risk of colon and rectal cancer include:\nIndividuals with a family history of colon or rectal cancer.\nIndividuals with a history of polyps.\nIndividuals with inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis).\nIndividuals with a genetic predisposition to colon or rectal cancer, such as hereditary non-polyposis colon cancer (HNPCC) syndrome or familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) syndrome.\nIndividuals who have had radiation to the belly or pelvic area to treat a prior cancer.\nTalk with your doctor about your medical history, and what colorectal cancer screening test and schedule is best for you. For more information on colorectal cancer screening from the ACS, you can read ACS recommendations for colorectal cancer early detection.\nIn general, screening is not recommended for people who are at average risk. However, the US Preventative Task Force does have screening guidelines for those who are at high risk of lung cancer due to cigarette smoking. Screening might be right for you if you meet the following:\n50 to 80 years of age and in fairly good health.\nCurrently smoke or have quit within the past 15 years.\nHave at least a 20 pack-year smoking history (A pack-year is the number of cigarette packs smoked each day multiplied by the number of years a person has smoked. Someone who smoked a pack of cigarettes per day for 20 years has a 20 pack-year smoking history, as does someone who smoked 2 packs a day for 10 years).\nHave gone through smoking cessation counseling if they are current smokers.\nScreening is done with a yearly low-dose CT scan (LDCT) of the chest. If you fit the list above, you and your provider should talk about whether you want to start screening. There are risks, benefits, and limitations to low-dose CT scans that you should discuss with your care team. Learn more about lung cancer screening.\nSun Exposure and Skin Cancer Risk\nSkin cancer is the most commonly diagnosed type of cancer, and rates are on the rise. However, it is one cancer that in most cases can be prevented or detected early. While you may hear that you need the sun to make vitamin D, in reality, you only need a few minutes a day to do this. Exposure to ultraviolet (UV) rays, either by natural sunlight or tanning beds, can lead to skin cancer. In addition, UV rays lead to other forms of skin damage, including wrinkles, loss of skin elasticity, dark patches (sometimes called age spots or liver spots), and pre-cancerous skin changes (such as dry, scaly, rough patches). Although dark-skinned people are less likely to develop skin cancer, they can and do develop skin cancers, most often in areas that are not exposed to the sun (on the soles of the feet, under nails, and genitals).\nYou can do a lot to protect yourself from damaging UV rays and to detect skin cancer early. Start by practicing sun safety, including using a broad-spectrum sunscreen (which protects against UVA & UVB rays) every day, avoiding peak sun times (10 am-4 pm when the rays are strongest), and wearing protective clothing such as hats, sunglasses, and long-sleeved shirts.\nExamine your skin regularly so you become familiar with any moles or birthmarks. If a mole has changed in any way, you should have a healthcare provider examine the area. This includes a change in size, shape, or color, the development of scaliness, bleeding, oozing, itchiness, or pain, or if you develop a sore that will not heal. If you have a lot of moles, it may be helpful to make note of moles using photographs or a \"mole map.”  The American Academy of Dermatology has a helpful guide to performing a skin exam.\nLearn more about the types of skin cancer on OncoLink and the Skin Cancer Foundation.\nThis is a basic guide to cancer screening for women.

If this does happen, it is called cancer recurrence.\nHaving a fear of recurrence is very normal. The main way to reduce the chance of cancer recurrence is to have a good follow-up care plan, also called a survivorship care plan, with a health care team you trust. Knowing your health is being closely monitored can help reduce your fear of recurrence. If fear of recurrence persists, there are additional things you can do to help control this fear and reduce its effect on your daily life.\n\n\n\n\tRECOMMENDED FOR YOU\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tHow to Cope With the Fear of Cancer Recurrence\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tLife After Cancer\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tPost-Traumatic Stress Disorder and Cancer\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\nHow to cope with the fear of cancer recurrence\nLiving with uncertainty is never easy. It is important to remind yourself that fear and anxiety are normal parts of survivorship. Worrying about cancer coming back is usually most intense the first year after treatment. This worry usually gets better over time, and you should let your health care team know if it does not. Here are a few ideas to help you cope with the fear of recurrence:\n Many people try to hide or ignore “negative” feelings like fear and anxiety. Naming them will help you think about ways to cope with them.\nIt often helps to talk about your fears with a trusted friend, family member, or mental health professional. Talking out loud about your concerns may help you figure out the reasons behind your fears. This might include the fear of having to repeat cancer treatment, losing control over your life, or facing death. You can also try writing down your thoughts, such as keeping a journal, or expressing yourself through art or music.\n Telling yourself not to worry or criticizing yourself for being afraid will not make these feelings go away. Accept that you are going to experience some fear, and focus on ways to manage the anxiety. Be aware that your anxiety may temporarily increase at specific times. For instance, when you need follow-up imaging scans, you may experience \"scanxiety.\" Other times this fear often increases includes follow-up lab tests or doctor visits, the anniversary of your diagnosis, or a time when someone else gets a new cancer diagnosis.\nSometimes, you may worry about things that are unlikely to happen. Talking with your health care team about your worries can help by discussing the likelihood of your concerns together.\n Many cancer survivors find joining a support group to be helpful. Support groups offer the chance to share feelings and fears with others who understand. They also allow you to exchange practical information and helpful suggestions. The group experience often creates a sense of belonging that helps survivors feel less alone and more understood. Healthy habits like eating nutritious meals, exercising regularly, and getting enough sleep help people feel better both physically and emotionally. Avoiding unhealthy habits, like smoking and excessive drinking, helps people feel like they have more control over their health. Read more about healthy living after cancer.\n Finding ways to manage stress will help lower your overall level of anxiety. Try different ways of reducing stress to find out what works best for you. Tips to reduce stress include:\nSpend time with family and friends\nFocus on hobbies and other activities you enjoy\nTake a walk, meditate, or enjoy a bath\nExercise regularly\nRead a funny book or watch a funny show\n There is some research about the pattern of recurrence for many types of cancer. But no one can tell you exactly what will happen in the future. Your oncologist or another health care professional who knows your medical history can tell you about the chances of the cancer returning. They can also tell you what symptoms to look for. Knowing what to expect may help you stop worrying that every ache or pain means the cancer has returned. If you do experience a symptom that does not go away or gets worse, talk with your health care team.\n A main goal of follow-up care is to check for a recurrence of cancer. Recurrence can happen in the weeks, months or even years after your original cancer was treated. Your follow-up care plan may include regular physical examinations and or tests to keep track of your recovery. Having a regular schedule of follow-up visits can provide survivors with a sense of control. Find more information on developing a survivorship care plan.\nWhen you may need more help\nYou might find yourself overwhelmed by fear or anxiety even after your best efforts to cope with it. The following signs may indicate more serious anxiety or depression:\nWorry or anxiety that gets in the way of your relationships and daily activities\nFear that prevents you from going to your follow-up care appointments\nHopelessness or apathy about the future\nDifficulty sleeping or eating well\nNot participating in activities you used to enjoy\nTrouble concentrating or making decisions\nFeeling that you have nothing to look forward to\nBeing unusually forgetful\nIf you are concerned about anything on this list, talk with your health care team. You may also want to consider counseling. Counseling may help you sort through unrealistic and realistic fears and give you tools to reduce anxiety. Working with a counselor can also help determine if you have ongoing symptoms of depression or chronic anxiety that could be relieved by additional support, like medication or psychotherapy.\nQuestions to ask the health care team\nWhat follow-up care plan should I follow to watch for a possible recurrence?\nWhat is the likelihood of the kind of cancer I had returning?\nWhat symptoms of a cancer recurrence should I watch out for?\nWhich doctor should I talk with if I suspect a cancer recurrence?\nWho can I talk to about anxiety or worry I experience about cancer recurrence?\nCan you recommend any support groups or counseling services that might help?\nRelated Resources\nPodcast: How to Cope with Fear of Recurrence \nTelephone and E-Mail Cancer Helplines\nWhat Comes After Finishing Treatment: An Expert Q&A Why Cancer Survivors Should Have a Written Survivorship Care Plan Dealing With Cancer Recurrence\nMore Information\nNational Cancer Institute: Facing Forward Series: Life After Cancer Treatment\nAmerican Cancer Society: Understanding Recurrence",

Cancer can be experienced as a bump in the road, or it can have a profound impact on a person’s identity. Once cancer treatment is completed, for example, some people choose not to identify themselves as cancer survivors, while others embrace that identity. But regardless of how you choose to identify as a person who’s experienced cancer, having a roadmap for your follow-up care can help you navigate the complicated maze of consultations, tests, and treatments you’ll need after cancer.\nGenerally speaking, health monitoring and follow-up care for cancer survivors includeswatching for cancer recurrence, detecting any new cancers, treating lingering symptoms that resulted from cancer treatment,monitoring for late effectsof cancer treatment, and receiving preventive care to maintain your health. A customized survivorship care plan is like having a GPS to guide you through this unfamiliar territory of post-cancer life. Having a plan for medical appointments and tests needed after cancer treatment has finished often helps survivors feel more confident. It can also give survivors the freedom to plan appointments that accommodate their personal travel and work needs.\n — Cancer.Net Editor in Chief, Lidia Schapira, MD, FASCO \nThe COVID-19 pandemic has further illustrated the importance of having a strong plan for shared follow-up care. For survivors, having a written survivorship care plan that can be shared with family members and clinicians provides clear instructions that can be adapted to meet new challenges. For example, since March 2020, I have worked with my patients in person and through televisits to adapt their cancer follow-up care based on their circumstances and needs. As appointments were moved to video or phone visits and screening tests were delayed by months, having a clear plan became increasingly important. So rather than have a patient drive 4 hours for a routine exam, we converted many appointments to video visits to discuss cancer-specific problems (as long as they were able to have their exams and tests done elsewhere in their community).\nHere are some suggestions for making your transition to survivorship care a little bit easier:\n An important part of follow-up care is to watch for cancer recurrence. One simple trick to make sure you’re being seen multiple times throughout the year is to stagger your follow-up visits with cancer specialists. For example, a breast cancer survivor might have to see their medical oncologist, surgeon, and radiation oncologist regularly for the first couple of years following treatment. They can accomplish this most efficiently by alternating visits every 3 to 4 months, then lengthening these intervals as their needs change over time. This way, the follow-up care team can evaluate how the person is doing multiple times throughout the year as opposed to getting just a snapshot of their health once a year.\n It’s also extremely important for cancer survivors to resume orestablish care with a primary care physicianafter active treatment to make sure they are up to date with their screenings and general preventive vaccinations and their non-cancer-related conditions are managed. Primary care physicians play an important role in guiding cancer survivors to stay healthy, and having a written survivorship care plan can help facilitate this care.\n Cancer survivors value team communication between the various cancer clinicians they see during active treatment. That same principle should guide the cancer team to communicate the survivorship care plan at the end of active treatment to other specialists involved in that person’s follow-up care, particularly the survivor’s “quarterback,” or their primary care physician. Fortunately, new models of shared care between cancer clinicians and primary care physicians are rapidly evolving to meet the needs of the estimated 17 million cancer survivors in the United States alone.\nHowever, having a written survivorship care plan does not guarantee that the transition between your cancer team and your primary care team will be seamless. Miscommunication or a lack of communication between these teams may lead to misunderstandings around survivorship care, which often places a great burden on the cancer survivor. To overcome these problems, it may be helpful to plan the transition to your primary care physician during cancer treatment or to set aside a visit at the end of treatment to review the plan with your primary care physician and think about life after cancer.\nLife after cancer comes with its own set of challenges for survivors, but navigating your follow-up care shouldn’t be one of them. Allowing your written survivorship care plan to serve as your GPS for post-cancer life can alleviate stress and set you on the road toward whatever life after cancer holds for you.\n",
